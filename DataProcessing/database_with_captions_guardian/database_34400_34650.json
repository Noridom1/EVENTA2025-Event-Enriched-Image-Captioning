        "content": "\u201cWe broke the traditions of football in Spain,\u201d Javier Tebas says in a manner so matter-of-fact that it is genuinely startling. But then the president of La Liga has long been unafraid to speak his mind and, as such, it is not overly surprising he is so forthright during a discussion centred on his desire to see his country\u2019s top division become the most popular in the world. The ambition is clear and if that means radical change than so be it.\nThat has perhaps been seen most clearly in La Liga with the scheduling of games. Under Tebas, who took charge of Spain\u2019s top flight in April 2013, every fixture is now staggered to ensure they can be screened live on television, at home and abroad. At one stage this had the effect of stretching each set of La Liga fixtures across four days, from Friday to Monday, with some on Saturday and Sunday kicking off late morning, a significant adjustment in a country where for so long matches took place solely at the weekend and later in the day.\n\u201cWe always have to think about traditions but we have been working for the past five years to change the schedule so there are no overlapping matches,\u201d says Tebas. \u201cPeople said that would mean less spectators going to the stadium but instead more are \u2013 25% more. Why? Because there were times before that didn\u2019t allow families to watch football in the stadium but now there are many family-friendly times. The schedule is more flexible.\u201d\nThat may be true but the president\u2019s tinkering has also been controversial, specifically in regards to the scheduling of games on Monday evenings. The move proved so unpopular that it led to protests, among them the mock funeral put on by Alav\u00e9s supporters during their home win over Levante in February. Spectators carried a coffin into the Mendizorroza and proceeded to hold up a banner that read \u2018RIP Football\u2019.\nIt required legal intervention from the Spanish Football Federation for Monday evening games to be scrapped before this season and if Luis Rubiales, the federation\u2019s president, had had his way Friday evening games would have gone as well. However, the judge denied that, providing Tebas with a victory of sorts. But it was not long before he was again railing against the governing body in regards to scheduling.\nLast month it was decided the first cl\u00e1sico of the season would move from Saturday 26 October to Wednesday 18 December because of political protests in Catalonia. The change, approved by Barcelona, Real Madrid and the federation, means the game at the Camp Nou will take place at 8pm local time, great for viewers in Spain but less so for those hoping to watch in Asia given a time difference of up to eight hours.\nHence Tebas\u2019s ire and threat of legal action. He dropped that but remains adamant Spain\u2019s outstanding club fixture must be scheduled with an overseas rather than domestic audience in mind. \u201cOf the two cl\u00e1sicos there are in a season, one should always be so people in Asia can watch without being asleep and the other should always be so people in the US can watch without being asleep,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt is important to recognise that the followers of Spanish football are not just people who live in Spain. We must also respect the fans who are in Asia and the Americas \u2013 they are also contributing because they pay for their TV subscriptions, which in turn allows the clubs to pay big stars and helps turns La Liga into a global product.\u201d\nTebas\u2019s desire to see La Liga\u2019s international standing grow is undeniable. He speaks of it being a \u201ckey objective\u201d and the 57\u2011year\u2011old is clearly prepared to become unpopular in order to get as many overseas viewers as possible, which is not a shock given that since he became head of La Liga he has regularly and spectacularly clashed with Rubiales \u2013 most recently over Tebas\u2019s desire to play a La Liga fixture abroad \u2013 and on more than one occasion demanded Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain be kicked out of European competition. The Costa Rica-born Spaniard is as fearless as he is brash.\nTo Tebas\u2019s credit, he has taken a modern and forward-thinking approach to making La Liga more appealing to a global audience, establishing a partnership with Microsoft that means many decisions made by him and his team are, and have been, based on data collected by the tech giant. This has even included the use of sunlight readings to decide where best to base TV cameras inside stadiums for the clearest and sharpest pictures.\nThere have also been strategies such as allowing people on the Indian subcontinent to watch La Liga content for free on Facebook and streaming live coverage of Segunda Division games on YouTube, with the aim of \u2018boosting the brand\u2019 and increasing revenues. Recent forecasts suggest global TV income for Spain\u2019s top two leagues will exceed \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) at the end of this campaign.\nThat figure is dwarfed by the \u00a39bn that the Premier League is reportedly set to generate from its current three-year broadcast deal and puts into context the challenge Tebas faces to make Spain\u2019s top flight bigger and more lucrative than England\u2019s. He insists he is \u201cnot obsessed\u201d with the Premier League, partly because such are the changes in the way people are consuming football content that, long term, La Liga may be better placed to dominate international markets.\n\u201cOur cumulative global audience figure is more than 3.2 billion but what that means is hard to say given the concept of an audience is changing,\u201d says Tebas, speaking to the Guardian at the recent Web Summit in Lisbon. \u201cNow it is also about \u2018users\u2019 and the minutes they are consuming your content. It could be people who are watching La Liga matches but it could also be people who are watching highlights on another device. This is a growing trend and why, as well as working to grow our audience, we are working towards having more users. I\u2019m convinced in 10 years nobody will be taking about audience figures \u2013 instead we\u2019ll be taking about users.\u201d\nThat is for the future. For now TV audience figures remain relevant and, in that regard, it is a boost to La Liga\u2019s presence in the UK that a recently-signed deal means games from Spain\u2019s top flight will continue to be broadcast there via Premier Sports until the end of the 2021-22 season, as well as on LaLigaTV, a 24-hour channel scheduled to launch on Sky TV early next year.\nHowever, it remains a source of frustration for Tebas that La Liga games which kick off on Saturday afternoons in Spain cannot be broadcast live in the UK because of the longstanding blackout policy. Asked what he thinks about that, the president offers a typically blunt reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake\u201d.",

        "content": "A deadline is looming for the classy chaser, deregistered along with other Supreme Horse Racing Club runners recently\nAn end could be imminent to the barrier that prevents entries being made for Kemboy, according to his trainer, Willie Mullins. The triple Grade One-winner, currently second-favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, became deregistered when the Supreme Horse Racing Club was recently barred from owning racehorses, but efforts are being made to get him re-registered in the name of the Supreme members who paid for shares in him.\nThe importance of getting this done quickly lies in the fact that noon on Wednesday brings the deadline for entries to the Savills Chase, Ireland\u2019s equivalent of the King George and a very valuable contest which Kemboy won last year. If he can be re-registered by then, it will cost his owners just \u20ac700 to enter. If that deadline is missed, they might end up paying \u20ac17,500 to supplement him on 19 December; clearly those involved would like to avoid that, but even that would be better than missing the race altogether, given the horse\u2019s earning potential.\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on,\u201d Mullins said in a conference call with reporters on Monday, \u201cand, from what I can gather, that could all be sorted in the next day or so. It\u2019s very, very close to being resolved. We\u2019re all trying to make that deadline and at the moment I would say that looks good.\u201d\nBut an official at Horse Racing Ireland said on Tuesday morning that there was no change yet in Kemboy\u2019s situation, so this is evidently an issue that is going to be resolved, or not, at the very last minute.\nThere are approximately 28 other horses which formerly carried the Supreme colours and are in the same situation. One or two of them would potentially have business in the Grade One races at Leopardstown over Christmas, including the classy hurdler Aramon, and so the same urgency applies in their cases.\nEach of these horses has a slightly different group of people involved, believing they have ownerships rights, and it may be no easy matter to establish who is entitled to what. As a result, it seems possible that they may all be re-registered at different times, depending on how easy it proves to hammer out ownership agreements.\nGood luck to those who are trying to sort this all out. Ante-post punters are also in my thoughts; who would have thought the great game could come up with a new potential stumbling block for us?\nTrainer form is the only way to explain some of the betting movements we\u2019re seeing at Sedgefield. Both Warren Greatrex and Sue Smith have made slow starts to the new jumps season but have come good in the last few days and both could get on the scorecard again.\nSmith didn\u2019t have a winner from April until Sunday but there had been signs of encouragement in the previous days and then both her runners won at Uttoxeter. \u201cJamais deux sans trois,\u201d as the French say and let\u2019s hope they\u2019re right because Maxed Out King (1.20) is easy to like in the two-mile handicap chase, for which he has shortened to 3-1.\nYou wouldn\u2019t expect that from his form figures but he went well at a big price for a long way before fading three weeks ago. If his progress follows the general trajectory of Smith\u2019s stable form, he\u2019ll get involved in the argument. Two of his three wins came at this track and he\u2019s 9lb below his latest winning mark now.\nGreatrex, who has had three winners from his last five runners, fields Another Emotion (1.50) in the staying handicap chase. This ex-pointer would have needed the run in a hotter contest at Chepstow last month, his chasing debut, and better can be expected with the cheekpieces refitted. The grey is 11-4.\nDown at Southwell, Heavenly Promise (1.30) is a warm order at even money as the mare, from the hot, hot Fergal O\u2019Brien yard, seeks a fourth consecutive success. She\u2019s gone up 20lb since her winning run began just 36 days ago but still looked well ahead of her rating at Ffos Las on Friday and can defy the penalty.\nWillett (3.00) is a more speculative option at 10-1. The Sarah Hollinshead stable hasn\u2019t had a winner for half a year but there is quite a bit of potential for this three-year-old to outrun his rating as he takes on his elders in a handicap hurdle. The visor returns for the first time since he went over obstacles and Connor Brace is an interesting booking for a conditionals race.\nSedgefield\u00a012.50 Emma Lamb 1.20 Maxed Out King 1.50 Another Emotion (nb) 2.20 Induno 2.50 Tonto's Spirit 3.20 Strait RunSouthwell1.00 Battleofthesomme 1.30 Heavenly Promise (nap) 2.00 Nifty At Fifty 2.30 Terrierman 3.00 Willett 3.30 When You're ReadyWolverhampton3.50 Reassure 4.20 Waliyak 4.50 You Don't Own Me 5.20 Prompting 5.50 Thegreatestshowman 6.20 Htilominlo 6.50 Chinese Alphabet 7.20 Oh So Nice",

        "content": "Natural History Museum, LondonFlanked by Femi Kuti, Arabic singers and a whale skeleton, Coldplay are successfully reinventing themselves but their politics remain too vague\nFor all the grandeur of the 25-metre whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling, the Natural History Museum\u2019s atrium is a relatively intimate venue for stadium stalwarts Coldplay. As Chris Martin himself acknowledges partway through a piano-driven take on A Sky Full of Stars: \u201cNormally we have some fireworks at this point, but they said this building was too precious.\u201d\nFrom his repeated references (including some dreadful puns: he\u2019d wanted the gig \u201cnear Wales, not whales!\u201d, etc), Martin can\u2019t seem to believe his luck in having secured the \u201cnon-conventional venue\u201d for one of the first shows in service of Coldplay\u2019s new release, Everyday Life \u2013 tonight, set against skeletal life.\nThe double-disc album finds Coldplay in an expansive mode, trying out demo recordings, doo-wop, vaguely religious imagery, and even a political identity in sampling an incident of racist police harassment and decrying inadequate gun control in the US. Some of these experiments \u2013 such as Church, featuring guest vocals from Norah Shaqur, singing in Arabic, and the sinister, rumbling Trouble in Town \u2013 are more persuasive live than on the record, finding a solid footing in the confidence conveyed by the band\u2019s performance and the choice of stage.\nMartin\u2019s understated vocal is charming in a call-and-response with a gospel quartet in Broken. Later, the idea that Everyday Life is Coldplay\u2019s Graceland moment is reinforced when Femi Kuti (Fela\u2019s son) and his brass quintet join the band for a stomping, honking rendition of Arabesque. (They recently performed it together during an ambitious concert live-streamed from Jordan.)\nAny misgivings about white (you might say, the whitest) musicians accessorising with African instrumentalists are alleviated when Martin cedes the stage to Kuti and his band for an extended sax-and-vocal jam \u2013 an unexpected but welcome collaboration for a band that, one evolution ago, was branching out with the Chainsmokers in an ancillary role.\nBut the biggest question is what this reinvention of sorts is in service of, what statement Coldplay are trying to make about Everyday Life \u2013 and not only does it remains elusive in this performance, opportunities to clarify are curiously missed.\nInstead of being underscored as a talking point of the album, Guns \u2013 as explicitly political as the band have ever been \u2013 is skipped over lightly as a precursor to Sparks from Parachutes (2000). Daddy, too \u2013 a song that Martin has said was inspired by children growing up without fathers because of the US prison industrial complex \u2013 is introduced by the clarification that it is not about Martin\u2019s own dad, but is \u201can empathetic exercise\u201d.\nThere was also no reference to the band\u2019s decision to pause touring until it could be made environmentally sustainable, despite proceeds from this show going towards charitable organisation ClientEarth \u2013 and the highly conspicuous reminders of biodiversity flanking the stage. It is telling that Fix You, \u201can oldie\u201d as Martin put it, and Viva La Vida \u2013 the rare chart-topping pop song that can also fill a cathedral \u2013 had the most impact. For all their new sound and apparent politicised identity, Coldplay are still doing what they have always done: sweeping emotional statements with hazy nuclei.\nFew would expect them to come out on stage campaigning, but in the run-up to a pivotal general election, on the night that Stormzy \u2013 an heir to their Glastonbury main stage \u2013 mobilised voters for Corbyn on social media, the oblique gestures towards profundity seemed especially lacking in context and urgency. During an undeniably special and joyful performance, that was the elephant skeleton in the room.",

The White House had argued McGahn\u2019s position as a top adviser to the president gave him \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from a congressional subpoena.

        "content": "John Fowles\u2019s novel drew some of Hollywood\u2019s finest for its adaptation, but even Meryl Streep couldn\u2019t save it. Why?\nJohn Fowles\u2019s novel The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman has presented a unique challenge to film-makers since it came out in 1969. There\u2019s the authorial figure who frequently interrupts his own text to rewrite key scenes. There\u2019s the authorial figure of Fowles himself, who has a scene where he sits in a train carriage with a lead character. And, as Fowles put it in an essay from 1981, the book describes \u201call those aspects of life and modes of feeling that can never be represented visually\u201d. The novel journeyed deep into \u201cinner space\u201d where cameras couldn\u2019t follow.\nIn spite of such obstacles \u2013 or perhaps because of them \u2013 plenty of famous film-makers have attempted to get it on screen. Fred Zinnemann tried, with a Dennis Potter script. Mike Nichols briefly took the helm. Franklin Schaffner was also approached to direct. (Fowles once said: \u201cA Hollywood screenwriter came over to do that one, I\u2019m told he had a nervous breakdown after six weeks.\u201d) John Frankenheimer was also offered the director\u2019s chair, but concluded: \u201cThere is no way you can film the book. You can tell the same story in a movie, of course, but not in the same way. And how Fowles tells his story is what makes the book so good.\u201d\nFowles was inclined to agree that his book was unfilmable until \u201cwhatever fickle gods rule the cinema decided to smile on us\u201d. That time came 10 years after the book was published, when Karel Reisz was lined up as director, renowned playwright Harold Pinter took on the script, and actors including Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons were attached.\nPinter\u2019s involvement was especially pleasing to Fowles. \u201cI do not need to dwell on his universally acknowledged qualities as a playwright,\u201d he purred. He was a fan of Pinter\u2019s solution to the metafictional problems the book posed: instead of having the author step into the narrative, Pinter had the action move outside the period frame. The film starts with a shot of a clapper board and the action frequently moves from the Victorian love story of the novel\u2019s heroes Charles and Sarah to portray an affair that is happening between the two actors playing them in 1981. For Fowles, this was a brilliant metaphor for the novel.\nPlenty of critics shared his pleasure. The venerable cinema critic Roger Ebert called it \u201ca beautiful film to look at, and remarkably well-acted \u2026 it entertains admirers of Fowles\u2019s novel, but does not reveal the book\u2019s secrets.\u201d\nIf I were finishing this article here, I might be describing it as a success. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019ve just seen it and: oh dear \u2026\nIt hasn\u2019t aged well. I won\u2019t argue with Fowles about Pinter\u2019s ability as a playwright \u2013 but it\u2019s worth remembering that Pinter was also responsible for this poetry about the disastrous 2003 invasion of Iraq:\nHere they go again\n  The Yanks in their armoured parade\n  Chanting their ballads of joy\n  As they gallop across the big world\n  Praising America\u2019s God.\nThere\u2019s nothing quite that bad in his adaptation of The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman, but it gives an impression of the heavy stomp Pinter takes through the story, the resolute humourlessness of his script and the overripeness of his dialogue. Some of the latter I could just about forgive as faithful reproductions of Fowles\u2019s Victorian pastiche. Sadly, the \u201cI want you\u201d histrionics also spill into the present day narrative, aided and abetted by some surprisingly poor performances from Irons and Streep. It got to the point that whenever the camera panned out to the modern-day film set, I was half-expecting to see shots of Irons chewing on the scenery. Some won\u2019t be surprised about how hammy he is, but even Streep tucks into the proverbial pig, spending most of her screen time gazing wistfully into the middle distance while mangling an English accent.\nOn the plus side, there are some fine shots of Lyme Regis town and Dorset country. There\u2019s also plenty to enjoy if you like lingering shots of period clothing. But the pacing feels so slow that I often found myself wondering how the make-up department managed to attach the mutton-chop sideburns on to Victorian Charles as much as anything he was thinking or saying. In the 1980s narrative, I was reduced to looking out for Ford Cortinas. There were some nice old Rovers, too. But such fleeting pleasures don\u2019t detract from the central truth that the film is now interesting only as a period piece, while the book remains fresh and vital. It turns out that the cameras couldn\u2019t follow far enough.",

        "content": "Hans-Werner Sinn\u2019s opinion piece on whether electric cars are as climate friendly as they seem generated a good deal of controversy. William Todts, executive director of Transport & Environment, gives his response\nHans-Werner Sinn is quite the character. This German economics professor\u2019s writings range from the Greek crisis to migration, to German energy policy.\nRecently he has discovered a new passion: electric vehicles. Back in April Sinn published a paper claiming electric cars were worse than diesel. The study was roundly criticised for being misleading. Even Germany\u2019s largest carmaker VW felt compelled to publicly contradict the report days after its publication, giving a rare glimpse of its own lifecycle analysis based on company-specific data that shows Volkswagen EVs are better than their diesels.\nYet rather than backing down, Sinn\u2019s now back at it in an article published by the Guardian. Rather than forcing carmakers to invest in clean technology \u2013 the EU\u2019s current policy \u2013 Sinn proposes introducing a big fuel tax on car drivers which he believes would be more effective than forcing German carmakers to go electric.\nBut this isn\u2019t about Sinn. In fact, whenever you read a newspaper article claiming EVs are worse than diesel or petrol cars, that article will be based on a report that deliberately makes EVs look worse than they are.\nUsually the plot is as follows: a smaller petrol or diesel car is compared with a bigger, more powerful electric car; then the fossil fuel car is assumed to be as efficient as the EU\u2019s official tests portray (in reality its fuel economy is always a lot worse); and finally the electric car is driving in a region with a very dirty electricity mix. Then you assume very high emissions for battery production based on outdated studies and finally you pretend electric cars don\u2019t last very long and that its batteries aren\u2019t reused or recycled.\nThere will always be a new study with some flawed assumptions to keep us all busy and we could rebut these until we all drop. The advantage for the oil and diesel industry is that articles and reports, however poor, keep the controversy alive. Discrediting or distorting science is a political strategy, as Naomi Oreskes chronicles so well in Merchants of Doubt.\nSo let\u2019s skip the detailed rebuttal and just look at some basic facts. Every year we burn around 275m tonnes of petroleum and diesel in cars, vans and trucks in the EU alone. Petrol and diesel vehicles are hugely inefficient. Around 70% of the energy that goes into a car engine is wasted. Oil that is burned cannot be recovered, reused or recycled. Oil cannot be made clean. Actually, thanks to the rise of unconventional oil, it is getting dirtier.\nSo if we want to halt global warming we need vehicles that don\u2019t burn stuff. That\u2019s the unique appeal of electric cars, trains and buses. They\u2019re ultra-efficient and have no tailpipe emissions. And yes, of course, we\u2019ll need clean electricity to run the vehicles and to produce the cars and batteries.\nBut we know how to make power clean and we\u2019re making rapid progress towards exactly that. The UK has almost got rid of coal, Germany is phasing it out, and even in Poland and Trump\u2019s America, coal is in decline. Meanwhile clean wind and solar power are on the rise. By 2030 half of the EU\u2019s electricity will come from renewables driven by renewable electricity mandates and the increasingly robust EU carbon pricing scheme.\nThe rise of electric cars and green power are some of the biggest climate success stories of the past few years. It is the result of regulators in Europe, California and China doing their job and industry rising to the occasion. It shows what we can achieve if we set industry ambitious goals to clean up its act.\nThat might not please some but it is fair, effective and, for the climate, unequivocally a good thing. As the Nobel prize committee eloquently put it: \u201cLithium-ion batteries have revolutionised our lives since they first entered the market in 1991. They have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society, and are of the greatest benefit to humankind.\u201d\n William Todts is executive director of Transport & Environment, a European research and campaign group",

He was Tasered by Valentine, 31, but the probes of the 50,000-volt stun gun became tangled in his thick puffer coat and failed to paralyse him.\nThe defendant began charging at police on the platform before he stabbed Valentine in the shoulder. A second kitchen knife was later found concealed in the defendant\u2019s coat as he was led to a police van.\nHe pleaded guilty at Manchester crown court on Tuesday to three counts of attempted murder and to possessing a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing for an act of terrorism.\nHe is said to have become radicalised online, accessing extremist materials including how to \u201caid jihad\u201d and \u201cthe seven most lethal ways to strike with a knife\u201d. He also downloaded speeches by Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born Islamist hate preacher who was killed in a drone strike in 2011 in Yemen.\nDetectives from Greater Manchester police believe Mohamud, a Dutch national, began planning for the attack towards the end of 2017, when he visited family in Somalia.\nIn video footage from police officers\u2019 body-worn cameras, he can be heard repeatedly saying \u201cthis is for Allah\u201d and \u201cthese attacks will never stop\u201d.\nHe also told one officer: \u201cKeep bombing Muslim countries, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d As footage of the incident was shown in court, the defendant held his hands to his ears inside the dock.\nMohamud moved to the UK with his family aged nine. Between 2012 and 2013, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Leeds.\nSince 2015, the defendant has experienced several inpatient stays in hospitals in both the UK and Somalia as a result of his mental health issues.\nAt the time of the attack, he was not subject to a care plan by mental health services, and had no criminal record.\nAlthough he was detained under the Mental Health Act the day after the attack, he was later found fit to stand trial.\nIn a victim impact statement which was read to the court, Valentine said he had diagnosed with trauma-related stress as a result of the incident. His partner, a police officer who witnessed both the attacks on Knox and Charlton and on Valentine, had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\nMohamud will be sentenced later.",

It is the biggest fine ever levied by the Bank.\nThe PRA said the bank\u2019s systems were inadequate, that Citi had failed to have enough people working on regulatory accuracy, that it had inadequate documentation and that its oversight and governance \u201cfell significantly below the standards expected\u201d.\nIt added that the errors and omissions included \u201csix substantive matters\u201d, which led to significant errors.\nNew York-based Citi is the third biggest bank in the US, and is designated as a \u201cglobal systematically important bank\u201d.

Citi failed to deliver accurate returns and failed to meet the standards of governance and oversight of regulatory reporting which we expect of a systemically important bank.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Citi said: \u201cCiti has fully remediated the past regulatory reporting issues identified by the PRA, and settled this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\u201cCiti places a high priority on meeting its regulatory reporting requirements, and has devoted significant resources to UK financial reporting before, during and after the period to which the PRA\u2019s notice relates.

The women have insisted they will continue in their attempt to visit the temple.\nShocking visuals of pepper/ chilli spray being sprayed at Bindu Ammini outisde the commissioner office by one of the protesters . She has been moved to the hospital. Six other women including Trupti Desai inside the police commissioner's office. #Sabarimala #Kerala @ndtv pic.twitter.com/d24chgs8b3\n\u201cThis is about gender equality,\u201d said Desai, speaking over the phone from the office of the deputy police commissioner in Kochi, where the women were temporarily given refuge for their own protection. \u201cThe constitution has given us the right to gender equality and a right to pray, and last year the supreme court ruled that women could enter, so they have no right to stop us going to Sabarimala temple.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cEven if I know I might die in this struggle, I will still not go back. I\u2019m not afraid of losing my life, this is a fight that someone has to take on.\u201d\nSabarimala temple has become one of the most polarising holy sites in India since the supreme court ruled in September that women of all ages should be allowed to enter. Previously the temple had banned women of childbearing age, between 10 and 50, said to be out of respect for Ayyappan, the celibate Hindu deity to which the temple is dedicated.\nThe ruling by the supreme court, which stated that \u201cwhere a man can enter, a woman can also go. What applies to a man, applies to a woman\u201d, was heralded as a rare landmark victory for women in India but has remained highly controversial with religious and nationalist groups openly opposed to women being allowed into the Hindu temple.\nThe ruling is now under appeal. The appeal case was recently moved to a bigger, seven-person supreme court bench, after the four-judge bench could not reach a decision. While last September\u2019s supreme court verdict still stands, women have repeatedly been denied entry to the temple since it re-opened this month, and those who have tried to visit have endured harassment and violence. The government has also refused to offer police protection for women wishing to enter the shrine, describing it as \u201cnot a place for activism\u201d.\nDesai said news of their arrival had been leaked to the press and protesters, who were waiting when they arrived at Cochin airport at 4.30am on Tuesday. A group of protesters from the ruling BJP party, as well as from the rightwing Hindu nationalist group RSS and others from conservative religious groups, accosted their taxi as they drove into the city, ripping off the licence plates. The journey to the temple, which is on a mountaintop in the jungle, involves a long drive followed by a four-hour walk through a forest reserve.\nOne of the women, Bindu Ammini, was sprayed in the face with chilli spray by a protester after the group had gone to the police station to ask for protection. \u201cThe police didn\u2019t do anything, they just looked on and watched,\u201d said Desai.\nShe said they had explicitly been told by the deputy chief of police they should not continue to Sabarimala. \u201cThey said our lives are in danger if any of us try to visit the temple,\u201d said Desai. \u201cBut we have told them that we will enter the temple as is our right, even if they don\u2019t give us police protection. We will not go back.\u201d\nDesai, who is the founder of the Bhumata Brigade, an organisation dedicated to fighting injustice to women, has previously led similar protests calling for women to be allowed to enter the Shani Shingnapur temple, in Ahmednagar district.\n\u201cWe are living in the 21st century, where women are working and are in power with men, but still we are following a custom which is 500 years old,\u201d said Desai. \u201cIt is the duty of women like us who should take it in hand and change that mindset.\u201d\nThe attempt by Desai and her fellow protesters to reach Sabarimala was denounced by Hindu activists. Pratheesh Viswanath, a volunteer at Sabarimala who has vowed to protect the temple from women and was among the protesters who accosted the group, tweeted: \u201cThe Hindu society is here standing like a mountain ... no need to worry, our volunteers are there. We won\u2019t allow any urban naxal to break Sabarimala\u2019s sacred traditions.\u201d\nSJR Kumar, the state president of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a militant rightwing Hindu organisation, told the Guardian that because the supreme court ruling was under appeal, it meant women had no right to enter Sabarimala. \u201cThey will not be coming in, so there is no problem,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Czech academic Petr Plechac has run tiny pieces of text through a new algorithm that he says identifies their distinct contributions\nWhen the scholar James Spedding analysed the authorship of Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VIII in 1850, he pored over the details of the text and eventually attributed the play not only to the Bard, but to his successor at the King\u2019s Men theatre company, John Fletcher. Now 169 years later, an academic has used artificial intelligence to back up Spedding\u2019s theory and pin down exactly who wrote what.\nPetr Plechac from the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague trained an algorithm on scenes from Shakespeare\u2019s later plays Coriolanus, Cymbeline, The Winter\u2019s Tale and The Tempest, and on Fletcher\u2019s Valentinian, Monsieur Thomas, The Woman\u2019s Prize and Bonduca. He also ran a selection of scenes from works by Philip Massinger, Fletcher\u2019s successor at the King\u2019s Men and another possible candidate for authorship of Henry VIII, through the algorithm.\nPlechac then showed the algorithm Henry VIII. Looking at the rhythms of the text, and the combination of words used, it indicated that Shakespeare had written the first two scenes of the play, with Fletcher responsible for the next four scenes. Shakespeare then picked up the pen, according to Plechac\u2019s algorithm, with Fletcher taking over for Act II Scene III.\nAccording to the computer, this scene was written by both authors, with Shakespeare solely responsible for the first scenes in Acts IV and V, and possibly for part of the fourth scene in Act V. The participation of Massinger is not indicated, Plechac concludes.\nPlechac told the Guardian that his analysis looked for combinations of frequently used words and common rhythmic patterns.\n\u201cThis turned out to be a very reliable discriminator for both authors\u2019 styles. When applied to the text of Henry VIII, the result clearly indicated that both authors were involved,\u201d he said.\nThe findings roughly correspond to Spedding\u2019s analysis, which he laid out in the essay Who Wrote Henry VIII? The main difference of opinion is over the second scene of Act II, where Spedding supposed mixed authorship, and the first scene of Act IV, which was originally attributed to Fletcher.\n\u201cCombined versification- and word-based models trained on 17th-century English drama yield a high accuracy of authorship recognition,\u201d writes Plechac. He said that, since 1850, many studies have been published supporting Spedding\u2019s theory, but many have also rebutted it \u2013 including another piece of computer research in 2000, which attributed the whole play to Shakespeare. Plechac\u2019s approach differs, he said, because \u201cit does not classify entire scenes but rather tiny pieces of text to trace the authorship much more precisely\u201d.",

        "content": "At Christmas, Naples\u2019 famous nativity figurines dominate its shops, but the city buzzes with artisans creating beautiful ceramics, fashion and accessories year-round \nIn Naples the build-up to Christmas is chaotic. Pilgrims descend on the city, pushing their way through narrow streets to Via San Gregorio Armeno, where workshops sell handcrafted miniature nativity figurines. The religious scenes, which are made year-round to keep up with demand, are beautifully crafted in wood, terracotta and silk. They are prized by Neapolitans as the epitome of local craftsmanship: honed over centuries and underpinned by a Neapolitan blend of pagan and Catholic beliefs.\nThere are, however, many other skilled craftspeople working in the city that are worth visiting. A lot of them have regal roots and have survived the peaks and troughs of Neapolitan history. In fact, the modern perception of Naples as a penurious city neglects its rich and flamboyant past. While Florence and Rome\u2019s artisan guilds flourished during the medieval and Renaissance periods, Naples prospered much later, with the arrival of the \u201cEnlightened\u201d occupying Spanish Bourbon monarchy in 1734.\nThe first Bourbon king of Naples was Charles III who, according to legend, arrived into the city aged 18 on a golden carriage dishing out coins to the populace and promising to serve his new kingdom with vigour. As the son of Elisabetta Farnese \u2013 a family of great Roman art collectors \u2013 and the husband of the highly educated Maria Amalia of Saxony, he was interested in high culture and supported the arts at its finest level.\nCharles\u2019 principal passion was the advancement of pottery. In 1743, he opened a factory in the grounds of the Capodimonte Royal Palace, which served as the catalyst for the production of porcelain and majolica tiles across the kingdom. Stingo Antica Manifattura Ceramica, producers of the ornate coloured tiles, are one of the last bastions from this time. Its dusty workshop is east of the station, where timber factories jostle for space with Chinese wholesale warehouses, and is a rare window into a pre-industrial age. Every stage of the production process is done by hand by a small team of artisans, some of whom have been working there for 60 years. Individual tiles and colourful crockery (from \u20ac15) are on sale above the workshop. The two Stingo sisters running things welcome visitors to sit down with the workers for lunch or even try their hand at painting a tile.\nThe production of leather gloves also blossomed under the direction of the new king. Via Guantai Nuovi, off Via Toledo, marks the area where the glove-making workshops once thrived. Sadly, today, only one remains: Omega Srl on Via Stella. It survives perhaps due to its military approach to quality control.\n\u201cIt takes 25 steps to complete a pair of gloves,\u201d says its young heir, Alberto Squillace, son of owner Mauro, \u201cand every step is checked \u2013 at least twice!\u201d The Squillaces offer visitors coffee as they welcome them to the Omega headquarters, an apartment on the third floor of a dilapidated 18th-century building. There, clients can buy, at wholesale prices (from \u20ac30 a pair), luxurious gloves made from full-grain or peccary leather, tinted in a bright pallet of colours and lined with cashmere.\nSquillace and Stingo have become synonymous with quality craftsmanship in Naples yet the families that run the workshops are not necessarily the artisans that produce the goods. But Mario Talarico, whose family has been making umbrellas since 1860, is keen to underline that he is also the man that does the making: \u201cI am descended from a family of female umbrella artisans,\u201d he says, and is the fourth generation to run the business at Ombrelli Talarico.\nEasily dismissable as a tourist trap due to the cheaper umbrellas hanging at the entrance, inside there are piles of smart, striped fabrics and crude cuts of exotic wood, and the walls are plastered with press cuttings and photographs with famous figures, including the pope, receiving their own bespoke umbrella. Here, they welcome in clients for repairs and to order a personalised umbrella, which can be ready within 24 hours (umbrellas from \u20ac50).\nClose to Talarico, above the smart Galleria Umberto I shopping mall, is the Ascione Corali museum and boutique. Ferdinand IV, Charles III\u2019s successor, nominated the Ascione family, who were originally coral fishermen, to be the official royal producers of coral jewellery, when he wanted to reap the financial benefits of localised production. In Neapolitan folklore the blood red coral is a symbol of good luck and new life. Although many shops sell it in the historic centre in the form of a horn, Ascione offers the seal of legitimacy and adherence to a strict ethical and sustainable fishing code. (Visits by appointment only, accessories from \u20ac40.)\nAfter more than a century of decadence, the Bourbon reign ended abruptly in 1861, with the unification of Italy \u2013 and craftsmanship in Naples suffered without Spain\u2019s financial investment. However, the city\u2019s tailors survived and began to thrive at the turn of century, when attitudes to fashion changed and small family businesses, such as Marinella and Rubinacci, put Naples back on the map as a capital of elegance.\nThe tailors adhered to historic Neapolitan standards of quality but also took inspiration from Britain. Mariano Rubinacci\u2019s father, who began the business, was obsessed with the tailors of Savile Row, adapting the English style to suit the Mediterranean climate. To this day, its suits are sewn entirely by hand by artisans using British fabrics in the workshop above the elegant ochre-coloured boutique on Via Chiaia (suits and shirts made to order).\nNo suit is complete without a tie, and with Marinella close by it would be criminal not to pay a visit. Marinella, which shares Oscar Wilde\u2019s philosophy that \u201ca well-tied tie is the first serious step in life\u201d, has been the leading producer of neckties in Europe for a century. Its skill is reflected in a client list that includes presidents, princes and politicians, who wear the handmade silk ties with their traditional but unique prints (ties and scarfs from \u20ac80).\nTraditionally, Naples goes heavy on menswear. However, for women passing through Naples, en route to the chic islands of Ischia, Capri or Procida, it is almost compulsory to pick up a pair of sandali capresi from Pasquale Can\u00e9\u2019s tiny workshop on Via Nardones (97). Can\u00e9, who is in his 70s, belongs to a past era of old-fashioned Neapolitan charm and enjoys helping clients decide on the leather and finishes for their bespoke sandals, which can be decorated as simply or as extravagantly as desired and can be ready to wear in a day (bespoke sandals from \u20ac60).\nSome of these artisan enterprises are unknown to outsiders but in Naples they are household names, revered by Neapolitans who are keen to shift the negative reputation that has, on occasion, suffocated the city. With tourism increasing in recent years, however, and the enthusiastic younger generations, such as Mario Talarico and Alberto Squillace, keen to take up the artisanal mantle, Naples is striving to reclaim its title as the flourishing capital of craftsmanship.\n Sophia Seymour offers guided walks of Naples inspired by Elena Ferrante\u2019s novels, lookingforlila.com\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?

        "content": "Growing up Asian in Bolton, Patel \u2018wanted to be white\u2019. Now the superhero fantasies into which he escaped racism have won him a major art prize\nHetain Patel remembers what it was like to grow up in Bolton as part of the \u201conly brown family in town\u201d. He still recalls the vicious abuse he\u2019d receive whenever there was a special occasion and he was forced to wear his Indian formal suit: \u201cEven just walking from the house to the car was difficult.\u201d And he still remembers discovering kung fu movies for the first time, seeing heroes fighting in similar robes, and the transformative effect they had on him.\n\u201cIt was old Hong Kong movies late at night,\u201d he says, \u201cand much later it was Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This freeing up of the idea that a man just wears a shirt or T-shirt.\u201d\nSuddenly, Patel was able to reinvent himself, no longer an outsider in strange clothes but a kung fu hero. And why stop there? With a little imagination, he could pretend to be Spider-Man, Eddie Murphy or Michael Jackson. He became an expert mimic in the playground and, at home, he was a head-in-the-clouds fantasist, weaving Spidey-webs around his grandmother\u2019s house with little more than a piece of string and a paperclip.\nHe was also laying the groundwork for an artistic career that has frequently looked back towards these coming-of-age moments, raising questions about identity, communication and cultural overlap. It\u2019s work that has led to the 38-year-old winning this year\u2019s Film London Jarman award, which recognises outstanding artists working with moving image.\nLike Derek Jarman \u2013 the late experimental film-maker the awards are named after \u2013 Patel\u2019s work connects with an audience outside the art world, largely because he likes to wrap them all in the language of Hollywood: epic soundtracks, highly choreographed movement, impressive slow-motion effects (filmed on a shoestring although you\u2019d never guess). On 2017\u2019s Don\u2019t Look at the Finger, the turquoise and purple costumes dazzle, while the camera swings around the action in true bullet-time, Matrix style.\nAt first glance, it\u2019s a high-production fight movie, but the more you look the less generic it seems. The fight seems to be taking place at an African wedding ceremony; the kung fu moves incorporate sign language. Patel has brought together different cultures and marginalised groups, using a global language we can all understand.\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in bridge building,\u201d he says. \u201cIt comes from a personal place of wanting to fit in and be accepted. Of course, on paper an afro kung fu sign language film with transforming costumes shouldn\u2019t work. But when you hear or see it, you should feel instantly familiar with it.\u201d\nAs a child, Patel didn\u2019t enjoy discussing his identity: it was only through art that he felt able to express his feelings. Surprisingly for someone trained in visual art, he\u2019s spent much of his career in dance: \u201cI secured some funding and I went in with a naivety, not knowing the rules, which was helpful. I never had to pretend I had a dance-trained body.\u201d\nHis stage work includes American Boy \u2013 which sees Patel shapeshift through a range of movie and comic-book impersonations \u2013 and American Man, a satire on misogyny that has him appearing as a \u201cbad\u201d Obama. Experience in the dance arena has clearly fed into his video work. In 2015\u2019s The Jump we see Patel dressed as Spider-Man, leaping off the sofa in his grandmother\u2019s front room while his extended family look on in smart Indian dress. It was, he says, the first sofa he ever jumped off pretending to be the superhero. The suit took him four months to make, and the day of filming was fraught as his family had not been told what to expect and his grandmother \u2013 who had been recently burgled by a gang of masked white men \u2013 spent the session berating the (white) camera crew.\n\u201cLuckily, it was in Gujarati so they couldn\u2019t understand her,\u201d says Patel. The resulting piece is both funny and moving, an exploration of his family\u2019s roots (their own great leap involved moving the family to the UK) and our desire for shared experiences. \u201cAt that age, what I wanted to be most when I grew up was white,\u201d notes Patel, who was drawn to Spider-Man because the full facial mask took ethnicity out of the equation.\nHe\u2019s still working through issues with his background and you get a good sense of this in 2008\u2019s It\u2019s Growing on Me, a time-lapse video that shows him gradually adopting his father\u2019s look \u2013 a moustache and side parting. The reactions to his changing image fascinated him: at first friends would make jokes about him looking like a \u201cpaedo\u201d. (\u201cI had a BMX at the time and it put me off going to the track because there were children there.\u201d) People would stare at him in shops, or even tug it in nightclubs. Then he started getting discounts in Indian shops \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019d assume I couldn\u2019t be British-born so must be fresh off the boat\u201d \u2013 and a newfound respect among relatives who he\u2019d barely spoken to before. \u201cIt\u2019s just hair, but it\u2019s amazing the associations it brings.\u201d\nPatel\u2019s work isn\u2019t just for gallery audiences. He has a fascinating TED talk that plays the audience\u2019s preconceptions (he speaks in Mandarin, which a translator turns into English, only to reveal that he\u2019s just been repeating the same phrase over and over), while his YouTube videos can be equally engaging \u2013 his one on how to make a cup of tea found a viral audience in the Gujarati community, \u201cwhich is definitely not my audience in the gallery\u201d.\nHe recently secured funding for his next film, about two women who rediscover an ancient physical language that once united humanity. Inspired by the biblical tower of Babel, it will be about body swapping, and whether an increase in empathy could solve many of today\u2019s problems. He hopes to turn it into a feature film and winning the \u00a310,000 Jarman prize will certainly help. In fact, winning the prize means a lot to Patel in other ways. \u201cThe biggest challenge I\u2019ve faced is being recognised as a British artist outside of my ethnicity,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll get invited to do shows around the subject of diaspora or race. So to be acknowledged for the medium I\u2019m working in, alongside peers I respect and admire? That\u2019s yet another freeing thing for me.\u201d",

        "content": "Drug could \u2018rewrite\u2019 memories to help those struggling to reduce their consumption\nIt may sound like an unlikely route to abstinence, but scientists have found that a treatment involving a one-off shot of ketamine could help heavy drinkers substantially reduce alcohol consumption.\nThe scientists behind the work said that ketamine, more commonly known as a recreational drug and animal tranquilliser, can be harnessed to \u201crewrite\u201d drink-related memories. The findings raise the prospect that the therapy could in future be developed into an entirely new form of treatment for alcohol addiction.\nDr Ravi Das, a psychologist at University College London, who led the trial, said: \u201cThere was a really big drop-off, which was maintained or got even better up to nine months [after treatment]. I was surprised by how effective it was.\u201d\nThe study was inspired by a growing body of evidence that ketamine can be used to disrupt memories. In the case of addiction, memories can drive harmful patterns of behaviour \u2013 for instance, when someone learns to associate an environmental trigger with the urge to have a drink.\n\u201cEvery behaviour is encoded in our memories,\u201d said Das. \u201cAn important takeaway is that these habits and unhelpful memories can potentially be unlearned.\u201d\nThe study involved 90 people with hazardous levels of drinking, but who did not have a formal diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. On average, they were drinking 74 units of alcohol per week, equivalent to roughly 30 pints of beer \u2013 five times the recommended limit. They were all primarily beer drinkers.\nOn the first day, a glass of beer was placed in front of the participant and they were told they would be allowed to drink it after viewing some images of beer and people drinking. They were allowed to drink the beer, but on the second day, when the same routine was repeated, the beer was instead taken away.\nUnexpectedly removing an anticipated reward is known to temporarily disrupt learned associations. Normally the memory re-stabilises in the minutes and hours after the experience. But ketamine blocks a brain receptor called NMDA, which is required for the formation of memories. So the scientists hoped this short period of instability would represent a window of opportunity for more permanently rewriting drink-related memories.\nIn the study, once the beer was taken away, some participants were given an intravenous ketamine infusion, while others were given a placebo infusion. A third group got the ketamine but without the psychological intervention.\nThe method appeared to be successful. Over a 10-day follow-up, the people who were given ketamine combined with the psychological intervention showed significant reductions in their urge to drink, drank less alcohol and drank on fewer days than the other study participants.\nThe effect was sustained over a nine-month follow-up. All three groups decreased their drinking, but those given the ketamine therapy had a much more pronounced overall improvement, halving their average weekly alcohol consumption over the nine months.\nDas said his team was applying for funding to carry out a clinical trial that would investigate whether such a therapy could help people with alcohol addiction.\nRupert McShane, a consultant psychiatrist and honorary senior clinical lecturer at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cIf the findings of this study were replicated, it could be very important. At its broadest, it could imply that habits of thinking could be provoked and then usefully disrupted by a single ketamine infusion. If proven, this would have many therapeutic applications.\u201d\nHowever, McShane said that a major limitation \u2013 one acknowledged by the authors \u2013 was that those in the ketamine group happened to be drinking higher levels on average at the outset.\n\u201cThis is just an unlucky quirk, which sometimes happens when participants are randomly put into groups,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it means is that the key result could have happened because those drinking the most will also, statistically, have tended to reduce their drinking the most. So, unfortunately, we cannot really be sure about how to interpret the data.\u201d\nCelia Morgan, a professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter, who is also investigating the use of ketamine in treating alcoholism, said the study was an important piece of research but that more work was needed before a clinical applications to ensure that the results would apply to people with alcohol addiction and to ensure that risks were fully understood.\n\u201cThe fact that these are people who drink a fair amount but not daily, and who don\u2019t meet criteria for alcohol use disorder, means that the use as a treatment has to be tested,\u201d she said.",

Dressing up lib dem election campaign leaflets as a local newspaper? #Election2019 #LibDem pic.twitter.com/SOWNYz53ci\nThe Yorkshire Post went further and called the Lib Dems\u2019 Leeds publication a \u201cpiece of political propaganda masquerading as local news\u201d.\nIn an editorial the newspaper said: \u201cHere we have someone peddling imitation newspapers around the country in the hope that those reading them will be fooled into thinking the messages are checked and endorsed by the same local journalists who fought for their libraries; demanded their A&Es were saved; exposed that corrupt business person or found out the politician who was up to no good.\n\u201cWhen ordinary readers realise they\u2019ve been hoodwinked by the medium that looks just like ours, the next time they come to read journalism produced by us, they will trust it that bit less. This all leads to the powerful becoming more powerful; more insulated to scrutiny; less accountable to the public. It has to stop.\u201d\nThe tactic of masquerading political pamphlets as newspapers has been used by all major British political parties for many years, with local Labour and Conservative candidates also taking the same approach during this election. The Tories have produced a similar publication called Pudsey Future, while voters in Tooting, south London, have received a publication called Daily Press, which presents itself as a newspaper that is \u201cfree, paid for by local residents\u201d, but does not state on its front page that it is a Labour campaign leaflet.\nOnly one step above the notorious Lib Dem election leaflet bar chart is the political party \u201cnewspaper\u201d.This from Labour is particularly maddening. Utterly shameless. pic.twitter.com/U9apuTdbYN\nMark Pack, a veteran Lib Dem campaigner, said the aim was to get members of the public to pick up the newspapers when pushed through their door.\n\u201cThe intention from all the parties that use them is to get people reading them, and as long as it\u2019s made clear who the leaflet is from then that\u2019s as legit as any other leaflet or other piece of literature, not all of which say at the top who they are from but make it clear somewhere else,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the Lib Dems\u2019 systematic use of the approach during this campaign has attracted particular attention, potentially because of increased awareness around campaigning tactics and misinformation after recent election scandals. The party\u2019s infamous use of dubiously labelled bar charts to emphasise that they were in with a chance of winning a constituency has also come under repeated scrutiny, despite having been a standard campaign tactic for decades. The Lib Dems have been approached for comment.\nWith just over a fortnight until polling day it is unlikely that any party will be tempted to bin printed campaign material. To confuse matters further, financially struggling local newspapers have often sold front-page adverts to political parties during elections.\nA Liberal Democrat spokesperson said they had not distributed any of their material in the same area as the Basingstoke Gazette\u2019s circulation area but were willing to discuss the issue with the newspaper\u2019s editor.\n\u201cIn the meantime, we remain committed to communicating with people, and tabloid newspapers has been one way of doing this employed by all political parties for decades.\u201d",

The new legislation allows the minister to restrict 100% of payments in some circumstances.\nWithout an extension being granted by parliament, the existing trial sites are due to expire in June next year.\nDebating the legislation in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Labor\u2019s shadow minister for families and social services, Linda Burney, said the proposed expansion was a \u201cstalking horse\u201d for a national rollout, and confirmed Labor\u2019s opposition.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t create a single job, it is extraordinarily expensive and there are serious doubts as to whether it actually works,\u201d Burney said.\nThe Nationals MP for the seat of Hinkler, Keith Pitt, said that the card was \u201ca tough but necessary policy\u201d and had been welcomed in his electorate.\n\u201cMy community wants change [and] doing nothing is not an option,\u201d Pitt said.\n\u201cThe cashless debit card is by no means a silver bullet, it does not hold all of the answers for all communities [and] it is a complex situation, but we are actually taking action, as doing nothing will never be an option.\u201d",

        "content": "The injured and bereaved face financial stress, life-long physical issues and mental trauma and want a more flexible response from government\n\u201cWhat happened is unusual, and for unusual things, there should be unusual rules.\u201d\nHisham al Zarzour survived the Christchurch massacre in March, when 51 people were killed by a gunman who entered two mosques during Friday prayers and opened fire. But his struggle isn\u2019t over.\nNearly nine months on, he is among victims of the attack who are calling for a new approach and more understanding from the government, which has promised long-term support but has not always delivered what survivors say they need.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t deal with unusual things in normal ways,\u201d he says.\nAl Zarzour, 33, sits in bright sunlight outside his Christchurch home, his three children shrieking happily as they play around him. In April, he was too nervous to leave his house for the physiotherapy appointments needed to recover from bullet wounds sustained to his leg when he was shot by the gunman in Al Noor mosque. Sometimes he slept on the floor, afraid he might be shot through the window.\nHe had lived in New Zealand for seven months before the gunman stormed two mosques in the South Island city. The Syrian man was one of dozens who were injured, and suffered a heart attack in the weeks after the shootings. Since then, things have improved in fits and starts: he now sleeps for brief spells every night, waking up two or three times with nightmares \u2013 months earlier, he would sometimes go two days at a time without rest.\n\u201cMy personality is changed now,\u201d he says. \u201cI get angry quickly, and I\u2019m not social like before.\u201d\nAccording to a Christchurch-based organisation that has conducted about 100 recent meetings with victims of the attacks, the bereaved and survivors still face a litany of problems: financial stress from closed businesses and terminated incomes \u2013 many of those killed were the breadwinners in their families \u2013 life-long physical injuries and mental trauma. Some are still wrestling with New Zealand\u2019s immigration agency, or confronting a lack of cultural understanding from officials designated to work with them.\nRaf Manji is a former Christchurch city councillor who is now advising the Christchurch Foundation, the independent charity that carried out the recent interviews. After more than 160 conversations, Manji said it was clear how much support the community still needed, and how much trust needed to be rebuilt after missteps and misunderstandings following the attacks.\nHe has recommended New Zealand\u2019s government consider a \u201cflexible, bespoke\u201d system of financial support system that runs for at least two years after the shooting, more information-sharing between government agencies, culturally competent support workers, and a long-term mental health and trauma hub \u2013 as was established in response to the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.\n\u201cGovernment agencies were told to be flexible, and they certainly were in the frontline strategy,\u201d he said, of the numerous departments \u2013 including health, social welfare, compensation, and immigration \u2013 that had to work together to meet survivors\u2019 needs following the attack. But, he added, they had eventually \u201chit walls\u201d in terms of how much help they could provide.\n\u201cOne thing I often heard \u2026 is that they don\u2019t want to set a precedent.\u201d\n\u201cThe precedent has been set by the mere fact that we have had a mass casualty terror attack. You will not get a bigger precedent than that,\u201d Manji says.\nMegan Woods, the minister responsible for the government\u2019s response to the attacks, said in an emailed statement: \u201cThis attack was unlike any other in the history of our country, and providing appropriate support for the victims is a complex task but one that it is vital we get right.\u201d\nShe cited the \u201cdedicated and personalised case managers\u201d each family had been assigned, and added that it was important to balance information-sharing requests between government agencies with \u201crespecting the privacy of victims and their families\u201d.\nThe government faced extraordinary challenges in responding to the attacks, partly because not all of the community had integrated into New Zealand life, and many did not understand how systems worked, said Zhiyan Basharati, an advocate for the victims in Christchurch who has worked with dozens of victims\u2019 families to raise their complaints with officials.\nSometimes translators provided at meetings did not understand government systems either.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to bring people into the country, we need to make sure that they are integrating, that they feel safe, that there is no fear,\u201d said Basharati, whose family settled in New Zealand as Kurdish refugees in 2001. \u201cAnd to achieve that outcome, there has to be integration.\u201d\nWoods agreed in her statement that \u201cissues around assimilation and integration have come to the fore for the community in the months after the attacks\u201d.\nThe Christchurch Foundation\u2019s interviews with members of the community came as the organisation prepared to distribute NZ$9m donated from around the world since March; Manji wanted the community\u2019s advice on what to do with the funds.\nSuch questions have proved fraught. Many victims said an earlier round of more than NZ$10m raised by New Zealand charity Victim Support was disbursed without consulting them. Basharati, the community advocate, said the agency and other bodies had relied too much on the same handful of local community leaders, and the conversations had not filtered down to those most affected.\n\u201cSome individuals who are part of the boards, some of them have never seen the faces of the victims. They\u2019ve never spoken to them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou go individually, you speak to them, you go to their house, you give them respect individually.\u201d\nSome community members criticised a decision to exclude those present at the mosques \u2013 but who were not shot \u2013 from most of the earlier funding. Others decried the ruling that those with severe, life-changing injuries \u2013 a woman paralysed, a man who might lose his hand \u2013 were given the same amounts as those with less serious wounds.\nThe Christchurch Foundation plans, after the conversations with victims, to make payouts to the bereaved families and those shot in the attacks, and to set aside extra funding for the medical costs of those most seriously injured. Other tranches of money are set aside for children\u2019s education, hardship, and community initiatives.\nSome of the most severely injured were still recovering in hospital when the first round of funding was distributed, and their voices were absent from the conversations, said Basharati.\nIn one case, a 25-year-old woman who was paralysed in the attack had been discharged from the hospital to a property that did not accommodate her needs, and had to be driven across the city every time she needed to shower.\nThe government\u2019s housing agency had been in the process of making modifications to a home for the woman and her husband to move into, but Basharati said she had visited the property and found it was in \u201crevolting\u201d condition.\nManji said when Basharati told him the situation, he helped arrange for the woman\u2019s compensation to be released to her early, and assembled a team of people \u2013 including a lawyer who spoke the woman\u2019s first language, and representatives of a local bank \u2013 so the woman and her husband could put down a deposit on their own home.\nTalking to survivors from month to month reveals the volatile nature of their situations, and the starkly different challenges each family faces. Al Zarzour\u2019s parents and brother have arrived in New Zealand to help him and his wife and children, and are likely to be able to stay long term, providing the government approves visas for them.\nThe presence of his relatives had been comforting and helpful, he said, but \u201cmore responsibility\u201d too; once their visas are processed, he must help them find jobs and a place to live.\n\u201cThey are my family, and it is my responsibility to find for them a house to rent and buy a car and then to buy the things in the house,\u201d says al Zarzour, who survived after the shootings on donated grocery vouchers. \u201cThis will cost a lot of money.\u201d\nHis landlord has told him he must vacate his rental home by April, so he must also find a new house for his family of five. He is barred from his previous work as a plasterer due to his injury and is retraining to be a social worker.\nThe worst thing for many survivors is the uncertainty; some who are likely to be among the most severely affected do not yet know the outcomes of their medical situations.\n\u201cWe need to think about people who have bullet particles in their body, because if that bullet particle shifts, they could need emergency surgery,\u201d says Basharati, who believes more work should be done to track the victims and their needs. \u201cI mean, I get that this is the first time New Zealand has been going through something like this. But we\u2019re not idiots.\u201d\nOne of those whose future is in limbo is Ahmed Jahangir, the chairman of Linwood mosque \u2013 the second the gunman attacked \u2013 who is a good-humoured man with his arm in a sling and big dimples when he smiles.\nJahangir, who was shot in the shoulder and has lost the use of his right hand, will not know for another year whether more treatment might help.\nFor now, someone else is running the Indian restaurant that was his pride and joy.He is full of praise for how government officials dealt with his case, but his future, and that of his young family and his business, are up in the air.\n\u201cAs of now, I haven\u2019t planned anything for the next year after this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it as it comes. No certainty yet.\u201d",

The rest of the family has had their claims rejected.\nThe four asylum seekers are the only residents of the Christmas Island detention centre, which was reopened at a cost of tens of millions of dollars in response to the parliament passing laws allowing medical transfers for asylum seekers from Manus Island and Nauru to Australia.\nIn late September, the federal court ruled the family could stay until their case could be heard by the court.\nPrior to being moved in August, the family had been in detention in Melbourne, and before that had been living in the regional Queensland community of Biloela.\nHowever, there is no written documentation to support the government\u2019s decision to keep the family in detention on Christmas Island while waiting for their case to be heard.\nOn 19 September, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, justified to 2GB\u2019s Ray Hadley the decision to move the family to Christmas Island. He said because activists \u201ccut through the fence and chained themselves to the front of the plane\u201d when the family was evacuated at Tullamarine airport, the advice he had received from the commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Michael Outram, was that it would be safer for the ABF and the family for them to be moved to Christmas Island.\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nGuardian Australia sought a copy of this advice using freedom of information law, but was initially rejected, with the department saying no documents could be found. After an internal review of the decision was conducted, the department told Guardian Australia it had been advised that Outram had given the advice to Dutton verbally.\nThis is backed up by a separate FOI response provided to Labor this week, in which a letter from Outram to Dutton, dated 13 September 2019, mentions the verbal advice on the family\u2019s situation.\n\u201cFurther to my verbal update to you this week with respect to the \u2018Biloela family\u2019, the entire family unit continue to be accommodated at the Phosphate Hill facility on Christmas Island,\u201d he said in the FOI document provided to Guardian Australia by Labor.\n\u201cThey are housed in accommodation built specifically for families with children, with access to outdoor play areas, and age-appropriate toys and entertainment for the children.\u201d\nOutram said they had access to medical and mental health care practitioners, and interactions with Serco guards were recorded with body-worn cameras.\nNo other documents related to the advice to keep the family on Christmas Island have been released by the department.\nPriya told Guardian Australia in September that the family felt distressed and worried being held on Christmas Island.\n\u201cEspecially Kopika is saying she doesn\u2019t like this place, she wants to go back to Biloela. Tharunicaa is not eating proper food. I think they are scared.\u201d\nThe next case management hearing for the family is set down for 16 December. The case will not be heard in court until sometime after January 2020, meaning the family will remain on Christmas Island for several months at least.",

It was early July and Valencia had reached an agreement with Celta Vigo to sign the Uruguayan striker; more importantly, they had convinced Maxi\u2019s family and representatives. They had held off West Ham\u2019s late offer to pay his \u20ac50m buyout clause and a salary twice what he would be on at Mestalla. At last the deal was done. There was just one problem: no one could find him to sign it. They needed the final OK and, until they got that, doubt lingered. In Valencia the wait went on. In London it did, too.\n\u201cThey called and called but couldn\u2019t get hold of me because I didn\u2019t have a [phone] signal,\u201d Maxi says, grinning and sitting at Valencia\u2019s Paterna training ground after an early-morning session four months on. He was in the middle of nowhere. Well not nowhere exactly, but close: he had headed to the hills from Paysand\u00fa, his hometown on the western border with Argentina, away from it all.\n\u201cIt had been a long season and when I\u2019m back in Uruguay I like to go into the countryside, ride horses, fish, camp, go to the mountains.\u201d Places where the phone doesn\u2019t work. The last they knew was a photo of him with his friends gathered around a fire in the woods somewhere, mate in hand, not a care in the world.\nWhen he got back the deal was done. Maxi was heading for Spain\u2019s east coast, not London\u2019s East End. \u201cI was relaxed. There was a lot of talk of a lot of clubs \u2013 Barcelona, England \u2013 but I left it with my sister, my family. They were the ones who handled it all with my agents. West Ham was real, a big club. But the truth is that when I found out about Valencia I didn\u2019t hesitate: because of the language, the club, the league.\u201d\nAsked if he speaks any English, Maxi laughs. \u201cNo. Not even \u2018hello\u2019.\u201d But more important was the Champions League, in which Valencia host Chelsea on Wednesday. Valencia\u2019s then director general, Mateu Alemany, and the sporting director, Pablo Longoria, had won over Celta with a deal that involved paying \u20ac16m and Santi Mina going the other way. They finally won over Maxi, with whom they had been speaking for months, by making much of the opportunity to play in Europe\u2019s biggest competition.\n\u201cTwo years ago I was playing the Champions League on the PlayStation. Now I can play it for real and that\u2019s a dream: it\u2019s unique, not every player gets the chance. It\u2019s huge, even in Uruguay, lived with passion. When I was a kid games were at 3.45pm, which was a good time: I\u2019d watch them and then go to training with my club in Paysand\u00fa.\u201d\nThere, he stood out. His brother, father, and sister played but he played even better. He moved to Defensor, where he scored 29 times. He got 30 at Celta and he has six in 13 league games at Valencia, although he is yet to score in Europe, averaging better than a goal every other game throughout his short career so far.\nHe was a lively kid, he admits. As a player he was a battler and a finisher. There is a video of him punching a teammate \u2013 \u201cI got on well with him,\u201d he says, \u201cthat was a hard moment, we were losing, it was tense and it happened, but I said sorry afterwards and it ended there\u201d \u2013 and he was relentless, strong, no thrills. Think Luis Su\u00e1rez. The typical Uruguayan striker, then? \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he says. In fact, when it is suggested that he might be the most Uruguayan of Spain\u2019s Uruguayans, he replies: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely for someone to say that.\u201d\nOf his homeland, the 23-year-old says: \u201cThere are only three million of us, but you lift up a rock and there\u2019s a footballer. Lift another one, and there\u2019s another footballer. Personality is the key. That fighting spirit comes from there: it\u2019s the way we live the game. I hate losing \u2013 at anything. That mentality defines us, it\u2019s unique. We have that fight inside; my family has it.\n\u201cWhenever I played on the PlayStation, I played with Su\u00e1rez. He was my idol, from very young. I followed Liverpool because of him, loved watching him. That year they almost won the league [2013-14], what he did was brutal. He was so good: he scored all sorts of goals, every ball he touched went in. I would watch him and think: \u2018What a monster.\u2019 The way he inspires the rest is like no one else. The goals, the assists, the movement, a fantastic player.\n\u201cI feel lucky to have shared a pitch with him. I spoke to him in the dressing room at Barcelona recently. When I came to Spain, to Celta, he sent me a message. I never expected that. He would write when I scored to say well done. You hear people say he\u2019s a bastard on the pitch, dirty, but that\u2019s his football and he inspires his teammates, the fans, everyone. And off it he\u2019s such a good person: 10 out of 10. Learning from him in the national team is incredible: he and [Edinson] Cavani are role models.\n\u201cOn the pitch anything comes into your mind. Your wires cross all the time, you\u2019re bad-mouthing opponents all the time, saying things. But at the end, it ends. You shake everyone\u2019s hand because football is football and it\u2019s over. It all stays on the pitch, it never gets taken anywhere else.\u201d\nChelsea know what awaits then: centre-backs prepare. Maxi laughs. \u201cI do like to fight a lot. We respect them but there\u2019s never any fear. They\u2019re a very big club but we\u2019re optimistic and we beat them at their ground \u2013 which isn\u2019t easy. We really need these three points, so hopefully the supporters back us, hopefully we can compete.\u201d\nOne thing is for sure: this time Maxi will not go missing.",

After Stormzy endorsed Jeremy Corbyn and laid into Boris Johnson, Gove dismissed him \u201cas a far, far better rapper than he is a political analyst\u201d. Rayner tweeted that \u201cGove is crap at both\u201d, which prompted Gove to cram his entire foot into his mouth with the comeback: \u201cI set trends dem man copy.\u201d\nThe Twitter reaction was swift and unforgiving, not least because it is never ends well when a politician tries so painfully to be \u201cdown with the kids\u201d. But, aside from the usual uncle-dancing-at-wedding cringing about it, one Twitter user, @Duggs_Bunny, got to the heart of the matter with a reply to Gove that read: \u201cCongrats, you\u2019ve found the Twitter equivalent of blackface.\u201d\nGove\u2019s dismissal of Stormzy as a rapper rather than analyst highlights the sneering elitist bigotry behind the tweet. It appears beyond his comprehension that Stormzy could possibly be intelligent, political and rap. Never mind that the roots of rap music lie in hip-hop which was, at first, as much social commentary as entertainment. Stormzy has been a critic of Tory policy, particularly around Grenfell; he has created a scholarship for young people to go to Cambridge; he has launched the #Merky Books imprint to showcase a \u201cnew generation\u201d of voices. Stormzy is a far better source for political analysis than Gove, who is so distant from the daily realities of regular people he could not possibly understand them.\nFor Gove, Stormzy\u2019s rap lyrics have no merit other than to be appropriated. No doubt he revelled in being able to use \u201cdem\u201d, at once showing off his \u201cstreet\u201d credentials, while also highlighting his linguistic superiority. He probably aimed to mock the supposedly out-of-his-depth rapper; to show him the error of his ways for daring to call out the politician. The tweet was particularly insensitive given Johnson\u2019s history of calling \u201cdem man\u201d \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. Next time, Gove should take the advice from the title of the song he\u2019s quoting and \u201cshut up\u201d. Let\u2019s hope, for all our sakes, this is not a trend that his fellow politicians want to follow.\n\u00a0This article was amended on 28 November 2019 because an earlier version named the wrong Twitter user, @bugsbunny.

Rather, it is too nuanced and considered for the simplistic analysis seen in much of the media, and he should be given credit for being brave enough to adopt such a position.\nThe finest and most successful leaders today \u2013 in business, education, sport and elsewhere \u2013 are facilitators and enablers, not the outdated and misguided purveyors of the \u201cThis is what I say and this is what we are going to do and you will follow me, or else\u201d school that too many people still believe we need.\nI am not a supporter of Mr Corbyn, but leadership is also about vision and conviction \u2013 and, whatever we may think about the Labour manifesto for this election, it certainly presents a very clear and bold vision for the future of our nation.Richard BryantLondon\n Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s ability to have facilitated a generally acceptable position for most Labour party members should be applauded for its bravery in an era of governmental totalitarianism and its \u201call-knowing\u201d, complicit advisory management consultants.\nYour readers should look at The Facilitator\u2019s Handbook by John Heron. This lays out in plain terms the disadvantages of our current hierarchical leadership system and the advantages of facilitating change instead. Boris Johnson and Jo Swinson rebuke Corbyn\u2019s neutral leadership when all it seeks is to find mutual ground on which to tackle society\u2019s underlying problems. Mike JoslinDorchester, Dorset\n At the passing of the second amendment to the US constitution, Thomas Paine argued that on great issues of the day government should remain neutral, and thereby be ready to execute the will of the people. Where there is a contest of fundamental social values, only those with an immediate interest could legitimately state their position \u2013 government, of course, should have no material interest of its own that is independent of the citizenry. The free play of democracy, therefore, is best served without the intervention of the governing elite. Theresa May and Boris Johnson distorted that by insisting that Brexit was partisan, and that by projection government had a position opposed to other parties. This reverses Paine\u2019s principle. Corbyn is right that neutrality is a mature position \u2013 certainly legitimate.

        "content": "Debt soared at the banknotes-to-passports printer just as bonuses rocketed and business fell\nAt De La Rue\u2019s shareholder meeting in June, 48% of votes were cast against the banknote printer\u2019s remuneration report, presumably in protest at the \u00a3197,000 bonus awarded to its then chief executive, Martin Sutherland, in his final undistinguished year at the helm. Perhaps the 52% of compliant voters were half asleep. Five months later, the horrible state of De La Rue should be plain even to dozy fund managers.\nDebt has soared, borrowing covenants are tight and there is \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over the 200-year-old company\u2019s future if known risks materialise. De La Rue has fallen into a half-year loss of \u00a312.1m. The dividend is being cut from 25p a share to zero, which clearly should have happened before now. The share price, down by almost a quarter on Tuesday, stands at a 21-year low.\nThe farewell bonus for Sutherland, who finally departed last month, now looks a wretched joke about a licence to print money.\nThe new chief executive, Clive Vacher, was too polite to aim a direct kick at his predecessors but it wasn\u2019t hard to detect his diagnosis of drift in the boardroom. \u201cThe business has experienced an unprecedented level of change with the chairman, CEO, senior independent director and most of the executive team leaving or resigning in the period,\u201d he wrote in the half-year report. \u201cThis has led to inconsistency in both quality and speed of execution.\u201d\nThis, remember, was the same succession process that the departed chairman Philip Rogerson, who just beat Sutherland out of the door, described as \u201corderly\u201d.\nNone of which is to deny that De La Rue is operating in tricky conditions. Margins in banknote printing are being squeezed by over-capacity. Growth in \u201cproduct authentication and traceability\u201d \u2013 meaning devices to track goods through the supply chain \u2013 is not yet fully compensating. In the wings, the Venezuelan central bank has stopped paying its bills (but perhaps it was never a good customer to accept) and a continuing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office tied to \u201csuspected corruption\u201d in South Sudan probably hasn\u2019t lifted morale in the ranks.\nThe better news, of a sort, is that Vacher\u2019s cost-cutting plan, with a strategic review to follow, looks more credible than Sutherland\u2019s. The open question, though, is whether the balance sheet needs to be reconstructed since De La Rue is now a company valued at only \u00a3140m but carrying \u00a3170m of debt. In a rational world, Sutherland would be asked to return his \u00a3197,000 bonus but, of course, that won\u2019t happen.\nMini-bonds are a major financial scandal \u2013 or, more precisely, the scandal lies in the promotion to unwary small investors of speculative IOUs with enticing interest rates.\nSo one must welcome the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s decision to use a blunt instrument and ban the mass marketing of unlisted mini-bonds to retail customers from January. The Isa season approaches. The regulator had to do something.\nVery good, but an emergency 12-month ban also serves to underline two features about mini-bonds, which typically fund loans to small companies or finance property developments. First, the current regulations on promotions are full of holes. Second, the shortcomings should have been recognised by the FCA before the collapse of London Capital & Finance, which failed earlier this year owing \u00a3236m to more than 11,000 customers.\nThe regulatory system needs a proper fix. At a bare minimum, punters should be warned in triplicate when their investments are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Pre-approval of marketing materials is another option to spare the FCA the \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d game of chasing Google to take down suspect websites. The Treasury-commissioned review, led by Dame Elizabeth Gloster, a former court of appeal judge, must produce workable proposals.\nAs for the FCA, it may now understand the size of the problem. It reports 80 cases of regulated activities being carried out without authorisation, and 200 cases of non-compliant promotions. Intervention is essential but it has arrived very late in the day.\nThe next financial crisis, it is generally assumed, will occur outside the banking system. After all, regulators have focused their post-2009 reforms on big financial institutions, with \u201cglobal systematically important banks\u201d at the front of the queue.\nBut then you see the record \u00a344m fine for Citigroup, one such global monster, and you wonder whether the comfortable thesis is correct.\nThe Bank of England cited \u201cserious and widespread\u201d failures in Citi\u2019s record-keeping between 2014 and 2018. No real harm resulted on this occasion, but regulators rely on this data to monitor risks. A record fine implies an alarming level of incompetence, and perhaps disdain for regulators, at a major bank.",

        "content": "Catch up with the campaign with our daily roundup\nJeremy Corbyn has refused to apologise to the British Jewish community following a remarkable election intervention from the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who used an article in the Times to suggest that the \u201cmoral compass\u201d of Britain would be awry if Labour won the election because of Corbyn\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in his party. In his article Mirvis did not raise any new allegations about Corbyn or his party, but he said the Labour claim that it was doing everything it could to tackle antisemitism in the party was \u201ca mendacious fiction\u201d. He also claimed that Corbyn did not even understand the problem properly:\nThe party leadership have never understood that their failure is not just one of procedure, which can be remedied with additional staff or new processes. It is a failure to see this as a human problem rather than a political one. It is a failure of culture. It is a failure of leadership. A new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour party.\nMany members of the Jewish community can hardly believe that this is the same party that they called their political home for more than a century. It can no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism.\nAnd he concluded his article:\nIt is not my place to tell any person how they should vote. I regret being in this situation at all. I simply pose the question: What will the result of this election say about the moral compass of our country? When December 12 arrives, I ask every person to vote with their conscience.\nThis morning, at the launch of Labour\u2019s race and faith manifesto, Corbyn said antisemitism was \u201cvile and wrong\u201d and \u201cwould not be tolerated in any form whatsoever\u201d. He also offered to meet Mirvis to discuss this further. Many Corbyn supporters are exasperated by this line of attack, which they believe is being amplified by rightwing newspapers with no genuine anti-racist credentials, but Corbyn himself was careful to avoid criticising Mirvis personally or denying the existence of a problem.\nHowever, he did point out that the Conservative party said almost nothing on race and faith issues in its own manifesto. Inspired by the chief rabbi, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was important to speak up for the experience of Muslims in the Tory party too:\nAs a faith community, we commonly are threatened by Islamophobia. This an issue that is particularly acute in the Conservative party who have approached Islamophobia with denial, dismissal and deceit.\nIt is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism. It is as if the Conservative party has a blind spot for this type of racism.\nBoris Johnson said the chief rabbi\u2019s comments showed Corbyn had been guility of a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d on the issue of antisemitism. However \u2013 mindful no doubt of complaints about racist language he has used himself in the past \u2013 when Johnson was asked about this in Scotland, he seemed keen to move the subject on and he quickly made a wider point about Corbyn\u2019s supposed lack of leadership on Brexit.\nThe Conservative vulnerability on this issue was on display later in the day when Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to endorse Johnson\u2019s \u201cletter box\u201d article about Muslim women wearing burqas that was deemed responsible for a sharp rise in incidents of Islamophobia. Javid also claimed he was not disappointed that the inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party he proposed has been converted by Johnson into an inquiry into racism in general in the party.\nJavid published a Tory analysis of the Labour manifesto that he claimed proved that ordinary people would pay more in tax under Corbyn\u2019s plans. Labour says only the richest 5% will pay more in tax. But the Tory document identified six \u201ctax rises\u201d (some of them were just financial penalties, not proper tax rises) that might affect non-wealthy taxpayers under Labour.\nJavid also said that, following the publication of the Labour manifesto, the Conservatives have revised their calculations about how much extra spending they will entail, and what this will mean for taxpayers. By happy coincidence, the Tories have concluded that the overall cost, \u00a31.2tr, and the cost to taxpayers, \u00a32,400 a year, are the same as they were when the party calculated them before the Labour manifesto was published. Both those figures were widely seen as bogus because they were based on too many false or questionable assumptions.\nJohnson ruled out agreeing to a second referendum on Brexit or Scottish independence if rival parties demanded them as the price for supporting the Tories in a hung parliament.\nThe Liberal Democrats have been accused of peddling misinformation after distributing fake newspapers, prompting one local newspaper group to threaten to stop all coverage of the party.\nA sharp rise in voter registration, predominantly among young people, has boosted Labour\u2019s hopes in the general election.\nMichael Gove has mocked Stormzy for expressing his support for Labour and Corbyn in the forthcoming election.\nWondering how to vote?

All three men have denied wrongdoing.\nThe departures came almost four years after Caruana Galizia used a leak of offshore information, known as the Panama Papers, to reveal that Schembri and Mizzi, who was then energy minister, had become the beneficiaries of secretive Panama shell companies shortly after assuming office.\nDaphne Caruana Galizia \nMalta's best-known investigative journalist was killed in a car bomb as she left her home in October 2017.\u00a0\nAlfred Degiorgio, George Degiorgio and Vincent Muscat\nThree men in their fifties arrested in December 2017 and then formally charged in July 2019 with Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder, criminal conspiracy and the criminal use of explosives.\nMelvin Theuma\nA taxi driver from Birkirkara and suspected middleman in the Caruana Galizia case, he was arrested on 14 November 2019 in a separate money laundering case.

One of the journalist's final investigations was a leak of data from his businesses. He has previously denied any wrongdoing. On 28 November his lawyers deposited a letter in court to Malta\u2019s president formally asking for a pardon in return for information relating to the case. On 29 November the request was turned down.\nKeith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi\nThe Maltese PM's chief of staff and the tourism minister resigned on 25 and 26 November 2019 respectively. Caruana Galizia reported that they had taken control of secretive Panama shell companies soon after entering office. They deny any wrongdoing. Schembri was arrested on 26 November and released on 28 November. Police said that after an 'intensive investigation' they no longer felt the need to hold him.\nJoseph Muscat\nMalta\u2019s prime minister who served between 2013 to 2020. He was criticised by opposition politicians for allowing Schembri and Mizzi to stay in their posts. Having said on 29 November 2019 that he would stay in the job until the investigation into the murder\u00a0was complete, on 1 December in a televised address he instead announced that he would stay on until a new leader of his ruling Labour party was elected in January. The prime minister expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d for Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder and spoke of the need for a \u201cfresh page\u201d.\nEvidence later emerged that those companies were due to receive payments from a third shell company belonging to a well-known businessman. All those allegedly involved deny any allegations of impropriety.\nThe journalist\u2019s revelations triggered a snap general election in 2017. Labour won by a landslide but the victory did not quell Malta\u2019s political unrest. Five months later, Caruana Galizia died after her rental car exploded and spun into a field near her home in the village of Bidnija.\nTuesday\u2019s ministerial departures followed a five-hour cabinet meeting, during which Muscat came under pressure from members of his party, including the deputy prime minister, to cut loose those in his circle associated with the Caruana Galizia story.\nMuscat won the unanimous backing of his parliamentary party in a vote on Monday, but the prime minister is now battling for his political survival. He faces pressure not just from within his own party but from politicians and campaigners across Europe. His deputy, Chris Fearne, has described the damage from the scandal as \u201calmost irreparable\u201d.\nMizzi emerged from the prime minister\u2019s office at Auberge de Castille, in Valletta, just after 3pm on Tuesday to announce his resignation.\n\u201cIn light of the extraordinary circumstances and the general sentiment in the country, I personally feel that the right thing to do at this moment in time is for me to step down,\u201d he said. He denied the corruption allegations against him, saying he had \u201cnot done anything wrong from a criminal point of view\u201d.\nHis departure came as police conducted a search of Schembri\u2019s home in the north of the island. He had spent the morning being questioned at police headquarters. Schembri has headed Muscat\u2019s office since the 2013 general election, which swept the Mediterranean nation\u2019s Labour party to power after two decades in opposition. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nCardona was questioned by police in connection with Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder on Saturday. In a statement, he said he was suspending himself \u201cfollowing a discussion with the prime minister\u201d. \u201cDr Cardona declares that he has absolutely no connection with the case, but after police had asked for further clarifications, he feels duty bound to take this step in the national interest,\u201d said the statement.\nMuscat left Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting without making a statement. The prime minister was bundled into his car by bodyguards as furious protesters shouted, among them Caruana Galizia\u2019s sister Helene Asciak, who ran behind the vehicle before breaking down in tears.\nEuropean leaders are urging Muscat to step back and allow the judicial process to take its course away from the political arena. While the chief of police has made no public statements, the prime minister has been giving daily briefings in Maltese and English since a breakthrough in the inquiry last week.\nManfred Weber, the leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party in the European parliament, said Muscat faced \u201ca lot of additional questions\u201d following the resignation of his chief of staff. \u201cThe prime minister has to take over his political responsibility when it is about his cabinet,\u201d Weber said. Describing the situation in Malta as worrying, he called on the Maltese authorities to clarify the situation \u201cin the upcoming hours\u201d.\nThe European council\u2019s special rapporteur on Malta, Pieter Omtzigt, who is monitoring the situation, published a letter in which he urged Muscat to distance himself from proceedings.\n\u201cThe suspicions of Mr Muscat having a personal and political interest in the investigation are too strong for him to be involved with it,\u201d Omtzigt wrote in a letter to Malta\u2019s justice minister.\nA coalition of press freedom organisations, including Reporters Without Borders and Transparency International, issued a joint statement, saying \u201cthe whole truth\u201d must emerge.\n\u201cWe are concerned that the prime minister, by placing himself at the centre of the investigation, raises the spectre of undue executive interference in the investigation. The financial interests of Muscat\u2019s cabinet present the serious possibility of a conflict of interest for the prime minister with regard to the investigation.\u201d\nAsked on Tuesday morning whether he would now consider his own position, Muscat said: \u201cI have always said I don\u2019t intend seeking re-election. I don\u2019t intend to serve more than two terms. My role right now is to make sure that we navigate through this turbulent time in the best possible manner. Once this chapter is closed with the arraignment of person or persons on this case I will make my consideration.\u201d\nGalizia\u2019s family urged the authorities to act independently.",

        "content": "Safe, supervised injecting room will help combat drug deaths and HIV infection \nHomeless addicts in Glasgow will be provided with pharmaceutical grade heroin to inject themselves with, in a pioneering scheme intended to combat soaring drug deaths and HIV infection rates across the city.\nBut medical staff expressed their frustration, as they launched the purpose-built enhanced drug treatment facility on Tuesday, that calls for a safe drug consumption room, which they believe could help hundreds more vulnerable addicts, had been blocked by the Home Office.\nGlasgow\u2019s Health and Social Care Partnership\u2019s \u00a31.2m facility is based in the city centre, alongside existing homelessness health services. The pilot project is licensed by the Home Office and the first of its kind in Scotland, but the second in the UK after a similar initiative began in Middlesbrough in October. Individuals referred to it will be given a prescription of diamorphine tailored to their requirements, which they must inject on the premises and under strict supervision.\nPatients will take their pre-filled syringe from the dispensary counter to a small booth, furnished with a stainless steel counter, a padded chair and a sharps disposal box, which is screened for privacy but has a mirrored back wall to allow nurses to view their progress.\nThey will spend around 20 minutes in the booth, and then a further 20 minutes in a nearby seating area where they will be monitored in case of overdose. The facility will hold two injecting sessions each day, morning and afternoon, as well providing oral methadone for night-time use.\nWhile the focus of Tuesday\u2019s launch was inevitably on the radical provision of heroin by NHS Scotland, the facility\u2019s specialist staff were keen to emphasise the intensive nature of the scheme. The frequency of visits \u2013 twice daily, seven days a week - means that ongoing relationships are forged with nurses who can then introduce patients to on-site support, including mental and physical health checks and treatment, in particular for those diagnosed with HIV, welfare rights and housing advice. This holistic approach aims to stabilise and reduce drug use.\nThe facility includes the newest equipment, such as a portable vein finder to reduce wound sites and vascular damage that is common with chronic injecting. Staff also hope that safer behaviour \u2013 such a using clean needles and correct injecting technique \u2013 will filter out on to the street where Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board saw the highest number of deaths in Scotland last year, at 394.\nDr Saket Priyadarshi, associate medical director and senior medical officer, Glasgow Alcohol and Drug Recovery Services described the facility as \u201cmuch-needed\u201d.\nFindings from international trials suggest that the supervised use of medicinal heroin can be an effective alternative treatment for the small minority of entrenched opioid users who fail to respond to mainstream substitution therapy using methadone or buprenorphine.\n\u201cIt is only appropriate that, as in other branches of medicine, we can offer addictions patients the next line in treatment,\u201d Priyadarshi said.\nBut he expressed his \u201cfrustration\u201d that plans for a drug consumption room, where addicts can use their own drugs in safer conditions, had stalled, despite support from both Glasgow city council and the Scottish government. Such a facility would require the UK government to either amend the Misuse of Drugs Act or delegate further powers to Holyrood.\n\u201cWe have new cases of HIV every year and our drug-related death rate is rising too, and the people who are experiencing the most significant harms are those who would benefit from a drug consumption room,\u201d Priyadarshi said.\nWhile the new facility plans to accommodate up to 20 patients by the end of the first year, Priyadarshi argued that a drug consumption room \u2013 which specialists describe as \u201can enhanced needle exchange\u201d \u2013 could help many more.\n\u201cWe have a vulnerable injecting population of 500 to 600 in the city and a drug consumption room is very confident of engaging a high percentage of them. There is a strong evidence base and cross-party consensus now.\u201d",

In the fallout from his firm\u2019s collapse, a judge said Woodhouse\u2019s business model appeared to be \u201cthoroughly dishonest\u201d.\nSubmissions to support the application to take Carlauren into administration stated: \u201c[Duff & Phelps\u2019 Philip] Duffy has very considerable and relevant experience from his work on a recent and very similar complex unitised sales insolvency, the Northern Powerhouse Developments insolvency. The similarities between the operation of Carlauren Group and the NPD are striking\u201d.\nThe application claims that despite Carlauren raising \u201cover \u00a375m for the purchase and redevelopment of properties into luxury care homes \u2026 not a single scheme has been delivered\u201d.\n\u201cThe group only operated two care homes without any of the luxury facilities and service promised to investors. Both of those care homes traded at substantial losses and were closed in July/August 2019. It had nine operational hotels, none of which are luxury facilities.\u201d\nMurray claims to have secured a \u00a310m rescue deal of his own. He denies there is a \u00a350m shortfall, or misusing investor funds, and says the jet, yachts and cars were acquired as part of \u201can exclusive membership programme\u201d.\nThe case continues.",

They have also shared digital campaigning methods.\nThe Labour International and DSA volunteers have also been running phone-banking sessions from Chicago, Toronto, Louisville and San Francisco.\nThe New York sessions are also being supported by overseas members of the Party of European Socialists, who have helped to source office space for canvassing sessions.\nIn Germany, where there are 16,000 British people registered to vote in the capital, Berlin, volunteers have been canvassing for Labour in bars and cafes as well as speaking to Britons at English-language events and talking to university students.\nMomentum supporters in Paris have been leafleting Eurostar\u2019s British customers ahead of voter registration closing. New Labour International groups have set up in southern France for the first time this election, with campaigners meeting in cities such as Lyon to try and turn out the expat vote.\nThe international campaigning effort for Labour comes as Momentum claims its work could swing the election. It has encouraged more than 100,000 people to register to vote since the beginning of the campaign through Facebook adverts, including at least 87,000 in marginal constituencies.\nOf the 101,422 so far who may have registered via Momentum\u2019s voter registration adverts, it claims the majority were younger voters \u2013 below the age of 35 \u2013 in key marginal constituencies.\nMomentum has been targeting young people in marginals with viral videos such as \u201cWe Don\u2019t Want Your Vote\u201d \u2013 viewed 1.1m times on Facebook \u2013 and \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Vote\u201d.\nLaura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, said: \u201cAll the polls are based on the assumption that young people and those who haven\u2019t voted before won\u2019t bother turning out. But this election we are seeing record numbers register to vote \u2013 including nearly 100,000 whom we have encouraged to register in marginal constituencies, which could swing the election.\u201d",

        "content": "New phase of investigation will seek to determine whether Trump\u2019s conduct amounts to \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019\nThe House judiciary committee on Tuesday will hold its first public impeachment hearing part of a new phase of the investigation that will seek to determine whether the president\u2019s actions amount to \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d as provided for in the US constitution.\nThe hearing, titled The Impeachment Inquiry into President Donald J Trump: Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, is scheduled for 4 December at 10am to \u201cexplore the framework put in place to respond to serious allegations of impeachable misconduct like those against President Trump,\u201d chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement.\nAfter two weeks of public hearings and private depositions, the House intelligence committee has started to draft a report summarizing its two-month investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\nArticle 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.\nThe formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.\u00a0\nAccording to arcane\u00a0Senate rules, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.\nThe presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,\u00a0John Roberts, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.\nThe presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of\u00a0Donald Trump, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d\nThe Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.\u00a0\nAfter the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.\nAfter the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.\nThe senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.\nThe senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.\nTwo presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.\nTom McCarthy\u00a0in New York\nDemocrats believe they have a strong case showing the president abused his power by withholding security assistance to pressure a foreign government to help gather damaging information on domestic US political rivals.\nRepublicans have argued there is no evidence linking the US military aid for Ukraine, in its conflict with Russia, to the political pressure campaign. The party is expected to remain unified in opposition to impeachment.\nThe witnesses at next week\u2019s hearing are expected to include legal and constitutional experts who will \u201cdiscuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment, as well as the Framers\u2019 intent and understanding of terms like \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019,\u201d referring to the framers of the constitution.\nTrump and his legal team are invited to attend and participate in the hearing, according to the rules approved by the House last month.\n\u201cAt base, the president has a choice to make: he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cI hope that he chooses to participate in the inquiry, directly or through counsel, as other presidents have done before him.\u201d\nIt is unlikely that Trump will attend the hearing. He is scheduled to attend the Nato summit in London during that time.\nIn a letter to the president, Nadler asked that Trump inform the committee whether he plans to participate in the hearing by 1 December at 6pm. \u201cBy that time, I ask that you also indicate who will act as your counsel for these proceedings.\u201d\nAdam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said his team is working to finish its report and send it to the judiciary committee \u201csoon after\u201d lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving recess next week. The report is expected to lay out the Democrats\u2019 best case for impeachment and possibly serve as the foundation for articles of impeachment.\n\u201cThe president has accepted or enlisted foreign nations to interfere in our upcoming elections, including the next one,\u201d Schiff wrote in a letter to colleagues on Monday. \u201cThis is an urgent matter that cannot wait if we are to protect the nation\u2019s security and the integrity of our elections.\u201d\nThe House could vote before the end of the year on whether to impeach Trump, part of a process that would trigger a trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, who have demonstrated cohesive loyalty to the president.",

It blackened more than 6.5 sq miles of the rugged Santa Ynez Mountains, but most of that acreage was scorched in its first hours Monday.\nDaniel Bertucelli, Santa Barbara county fire captain, told the Los Angeles Times that the area\u2019s steep, rocky terrain was creating challenges for crews, and that firefighters were expecting increasing difficulties as winds picked up speed throughout the day.\nRudy Gruber, 79, watched the smoke and flames from the top of a hill near his house in Santa Barbara.\nDespite orders to evacuate, he said he had decided not to leave because he didn\u2019t think the fire would cross a canyon to his home. Plus, it would be tough to move his 50lb tortoise, Amstel.\nEven so, he has been prepared for about a year, packing photo albums, computers and a carrier for his cat, Scooter.\nGruber, who has lived in the area since 1976, was facing his fifth fire but said he had only evacuated once, when he saw smoke in his neighborhood in 1978. He hadn\u2019t seen any this time, so he had chosen to stay put.\n\u201cWe\u2019re better prepared than we used to be,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through it so many times now.\u201d\nAn incoming storm was expected to drop an inch of precipitation on the fire area later in the day, which could help stop the blaze. It could also create new challenges, with possible debris flow and roadways being washed out.\nFire officials said the area had not received any rain in 180 days and that the vegetation was ready to burn, causing the exponential growth in early hours. There were also some rugged areas that were too narrow for firefighters\u2019 engines. \ufeff\nThe threat of fires has long been a fact of life in the area \u2013 in 1990, a major wildfire in the area destroyed more than 400 homes.\nBut the risk has recently become more intense and more frequent. After a fire in January 2018, devastating mudslides in the Santa Barbara region ravaged the town of Montecito, killing 23 people and destroying 130 homes.\nCalifornia as a whole has suffered from progressively worsening wildfire seasons in recent years, with the climate crisis exacerbating these threats and fires burning larger areas for longer periods and causing greater damage.\nThe fires this year in northern and southern California were marked by unprecedented blackouts, with the state utility companies proactively shutting off the power for millions when the risks of fires burning and spreading were high. The overall damage this year, however, has been significantly less severe than the previous two years.",

It was also a fundamental part of his development into a Champions League-winning coach who, with another Anfield victory over Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team, would lead Liverpool into the knockout phase with a game to spare.\n\u201cEurope changes everything,\u201d said Klopp. He was speaking of his outlook as a manager but the same applies to the confidence in his Liverpool team. \u201cNobody thought it would be possible when we played that game against Ashtarak. We got there by the Fair Play competition. It was a very big achievement for us. I know where I was when our sporting director telephoned me. I was on holiday. He called me and he said: \u2018We play Europe.\u2019\n\u201cIt caused a lot of problems because it started so early. We had no pre-season and lost the first five Bundesliga games. It was like the Burnley situation last year. We suffered from it but we stayed in the league and all was good.\n\u201cIn Armenia we arrived there and it was really warm. It was 40 degrees. Then we went to Iceland to play Keflav\u00edk. We played in Reykjavik. In the summer, it was minus something because the wind was so strong. I remember Sevilla. It is the stadium I hate most to play at and it started there. We got a draw, we deserved the draw but the atmosphere was completely new. Everybody hated us and I was like: \u2018Why, what did we do?\u2019 That was very special.\n\u201cSo you have these experiences and you learn from them. It opens your mind. It was a very important part of development for me as a manager and for the specific teams always as well. It seems longer than 14 years ago. We have come a long way. It was just exciting \u2013 it still is exciting and I love it. It didn\u2019t change.\u201d\nLiverpool are unbeaten in 24 European home games and have won their past 17 matches at Anfield in all competitions, if penalty shootouts are included. That is two games short of the club record set in 1972. Napoli are the only team to have prevented Klopp\u2019s side from scoring in the past 25 matches although the Italian club have not won in nine visits to England and carry painful memories of last year\u2019s elimination from the Champions League on Merseyside. Napoli can also qualify with a win \u2013 both teams will go through if RB Salzburg fail to beat Genk \u2013 and given Liverpool\u2019s December schedule it would be a bonus for Klopp to get the job done before next month\u2019s trip to Austria.\n\u201cUnfortunately I\u2019m not too good at thinking about games we have next week or in two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe team selection is about winning this game and nothing else. What we have to be against Napoli for sure is as tuned as possible because they have such fixed patterns in their game that you need to have your own patterns as well.\n\u201cAgainst us they adapted really well always. We pressed them in a specific way and they reacted in the game and found another way to go through, especially in the home games. Our home game last year was an outstanding game. The pressure was massive and if Sadio [Man\u00e9] scored three or four that night nobody would have thought it was not possible. We had really big chances for that and played outstanding but in the end Ali [Alisson] had to save us. It is different if you play there or here but we have to make sure they feel the difference as well.\u201d\nNapoli arrive under a cloud, with Ancelotti and the players banned from speaking to the media in Italy by the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, having rebelled against his idea of a training camp after their home draw against RB Salzburg. De Laurentiis has fined his players too, but Klopp believes Napoli will view Anfield as an escape from the controversy.\n\u201cI met Carlo in Geneva on the Monday after the Manchester City game and we had a little chat about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me a lot, I didn\u2019t ask a lot, but everybody can read what is in the newspaper. Carlo was in really good shape. They will try everything. It must feel like a relief for them to play a big game away and not be faced with all the other things. We expect them to be absolutely at their best.\u201d",

His fine production of Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s The Brothers Size explored the nature of sibling love. His own play is about an even more complex fraternal reunion but, while it is beautifully acted and staged, I found it curiously elliptical.\nWe initially see a tentative encounter between two men, both half-Iranian and in their 30s. Gradually, we deduce that Tom, the elder by five years, was given away for adoption at birth and is making contact with the brother, Samad, he never knew. Bound together by nature, the two men are separated by nurture: Tom went to the local comp, studied maths at Leeds and runs a computer business, while the public-school educated Samad read English at Cambridge and is in publishing. Tom seems impulsive, friendly and keen to meet up with his biological family; Samad is wary, anxious and protective of both his own privacy and that of his parents.\nI found the backstory puzzling and could never quite work out the reasons why Tom was adopted: was it because he was conceived out of wedlock at a difficult time for mixed-race relationships? Even though I craved more information, Sheibani is very good at showing the shifting balance of power between the two men and the tension between their instinctive kinship and social awkwardness: the closer Tom gets emotionally, the more Samad seems to withdraw. Sheibani\u2019s production, played in and around a bare circular stage, also gives the story a vivid physical life. Tom\u2019s passion for cycling and gymnastics becomes crucial and, in one extraordinary scene, the two men engage in a frenetic dance that is a mixture of violence and tenderness.\nThe two actors are excellent. Scott Karim as Tom seems permanently pumped up and overflowing with surplus energy, and Irfan Shamji conveys both Samad\u2019s guardedness and desire to acknowledge his long-lost brother. The vitality of Sheibani\u2019s production more than compensates for the cryptic nature of his play.\nAt Bush theatre, London, until 18 January.",

He has taken Rugby Australia to court seeking damages, an apology and reinstatement from RA and his former club, the NSW Waratahs.\nIn an amended statement of claim published on the federal circuit court\u2019s website on Wednesday, Folau stated his loss and damage of $14m consisted of:\nHis player contract from May 2019 to November 2022 of $4.2m\nLost guaranteed test match payments adding up to $300,000\nLost test match payments for 2022 of $150,000\nLost sponsorship revenue of $300,000\nLost Israel Folau branded kids\u2019 camp payments of $300,000\nAdditional base salary and other payments of between $1.5m and $3m\nLoss of money from the end of his international career of between $500,000 and $4.5m\nPost-career benefits, including what would have been on offer for him if Folau had become captain of the Wallabies. This is estimated at between $450,000 and $1.25m.\nFolau has also alleged one of the three members appointed to the tribunal by Rugby Australia to assess his contract breach earlier this year, Kate Eastman SC, should have been recused for apprehended bias.\nThe document states Folau objected to her appointment because Eastman had been a co-founder of the Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, an organisation Folau said had advocated for the LGBTI community. Folau alleged Eastman had been a member of other organisations that had advocated for the LGBTI community, or had an involvement in \u201cthe human rights sphere\u201d and that this was not disclosed at hearings.\nIn the claim of bias, Folau also confirmed Rugby Australia\u2019s allegation that he had offered to apologise for the posts.\nThe proposed apology stated: \u201cI sincerely understand that what I have posted has been hurtful to some readers. This was never my intention, so for that reason, I wholeheartedly apologise for any pain or sense of confusion that that has caused.\u201d\nFolau also offered to be trained, and offered to have RA review his social media posts before they went up. Folau said he was willing to pay a fine and make a donation to Sydney Children\u2019s hospital in Randwick and serve a suspension of four weeks.\nFolau told the tribunal in April he had 15 team-mates and members of the coaching staff supporting him and urging him to return to the field.\nFolau alleges that Eastman acted with bias because there was no attempt by her or the other tribunal members to go through conciliation or mediation before terminating his contract.\nFolau reportedly told an Australian Christian Lobby conference last month that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d repeat the posts again, and earlier this month gave a sermon in his Sydney church linking the bushfires ravaging parts of Australia at the time to legalisation of same-sex marriage and the decriminalisation of abortion.\nA mediation hearing for the case is set down for 2 December, but the hearing is not open to media.",

But courts have consistently set the bar so high that it has been largely useless to media organisations.\nThe ruling comes as the federal and state governments consider changes to Australia\u2019s defamation laws following criticism that the current regime has had a chilling effect on free speech.\nCanadian Daniel Schlaepfer, who owns Cayman Islands-based Select Vantage, accused the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) and its head of market supervision, Greg Yanco, of defaming him by warning local brokers not to deal with him during phone calls and meetings in November 2014.\nSchlaepfer claimed Yanco defamed him during the calls and meetings by accusing him and Select Vantage of market manipulation and said Asic\u2019s action destroyed his business in Australia after brokers refused to deal with him.\nBut on Tuesday New South Wales supreme court judge Des Fagan found that Yanco did not identify Schlaepfer or Select Vantage when talking to the brokers, and that even if he did it was true that Schlaepfer knew that the company didn\u2019t do enough to prevent traders rigging the market.\nFagan also found that Yanco\u2019s communications with the brokers, during which he warned them that they might be approached by a risky but high-paying client looking for direct access to the market, were protected by common law qualified privilege.\n\u201cThe occasion of Mr Yanco\u2019s conveying to the brokers that Asic was concerned about the trading behaviour of a client who may be looking to engage their DMA [direct market access] services was privileged by the community of interest of himself and the listeners,\u201d Fagan said in his judgment.\n\u201cThe occasion protected his communications even if they conveyed defamatory meanings with respect to Mr Schlaepfer.\u201d\nFagan also said that Yanco\u2019s statements were protected by qualified privilege provisions in the Defamation Act, but these findings will be less useful to media defendants because they rely on Asic\u2019s role as a market regulator.\n\u201cA great deal of damage could be done to the reputation of the stock exchange if Mr Yanco should be required to gather more extensive evidence than he did before warning other brokers,\u201d Fagan said.\nA spokesman for Select Vantage said: \u201c[The company] does not accept the findings against its traders but notes the finding that Mr Schlaepfer was not knowingly involved in any market manipulation.

I\u2019ve proven my innocence, but also proven that there are reasons why you need all the facts before you can demand debt payments from people.\u201d\nMcRae said while last week\u2019s changes are \u201csignificant\u201d they came \u201ctoo late for many people who have experienced distress and hardship, or who have already paid robodebts through tax garnishee action and debt collectors\u201d.\n\u201cToday\u2019s result shows the federal government has accepted what advocates have been saying for years \u2013 using only income averaging to raise debts is both inaccurate and inconsistent with the Social Security Act.\u201d\nThe shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus said the judgment \u201csimply confirms that we have got a Commonwealth government that has been extorting money from Australian citizens with no basis for doing so\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary scandal, robodebt,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cI just think that the prime minister owes the Australian people an apology for this extraordinary program.\u201d\nOn Wednesday the Senate passed a motion ordering the government to produce legal advice explaining why it made the changes to the system, with Greens senator Rachel Siewert demanding to know \u201cthe legal status of this program\u201d.",

Both political and economic power are hoarded by a handful of people in London and the south-east and this has damaged all parts of the country, from Newcastle to Newham.\u201d\nThe report, published on Wednesday, stresses that the inequality in Britain is far more complex than a north-south divide or \u201ccities versus towns\u201d, pointing to high levels of poverty in parts of inner-city London as well as the existence of affluent towns and stagnant cities.\nIt said that by some measures, such as life satisfaction and the homicide rate, the UK was less divided than other developed countries. However the UK is \u201cconsistently more divided than any comparable country\u201d when it comes to vital topics such as productivity, income, unemployment, health and politics, the research found.\nIn terms of productivity, which economists believe is vital for economic growth and raising living standards, the UK is the most regionally divided country of its size and level of development and has not improved for a decade.\nThe only countries that are more regionally unequal in productivity are very different in other ways, the report said, such as many eastern Europe economies that are far smaller than the UK.\nRaikes, who authored the report, said the divide in terms of disposable income had grown in the UK in recent years, with an average \u00a348,000 per person gap between those living in the wealthiest areas and those in the most deprived.\nOn this measure, the UK is more regionally divided than any other country of its size and development \u2013 such as Germany, Spain and Italy \u2013 and is second only to Israel, a country with the population of London, in terms of inequality of disposable income between richest and poorest.\nIPPR North, along with political leaders from across the spectrum in the north of England and in the Midlands, have long called for further devolution of powers and funding in order to shrink the UK\u2019s productivity gap and address its regional divides.\nIPPR\u2019s annual report State of the North pointed out that the north of England\u2019s economy is larger than the economies of most EU countries yet was being held back by Whitehall and Westminster, describing Britain as \u201cthe most centralised country of its size in the developed world\u201d.\nArianna Giovannini, the interim director of IPPR North, said 2019 had \u201cexposed our country\u2019s regional divides\u201d and that economic uncertainty had permeated every corner of the UK as the Brexit debate raged in Westminster.\nShe added: \u201cBut 2019 also showed the great promise of devolution. Mayors in the north have shown what\u2019s possible, despite the limited amount of devolved power they currently have. Devolution must be the way forward for the country, and all areas need substantial power and funding.\n\u201cThe next government must lead a devolution parliament \u2013 an unprecedented and irreversible shift of power \u2013 so that England\u2019s regions, towns and cities can work together to bridge our regional divides.\u201d\n The headline of this article was amended on 27 November 2019 to better reflect the content of the report.",

But with Mel C \u2013 or Melanie C as she styles herself these days \u2013 that\u2019s not the case.\nEven if she was your favourite Spice Girl, and you have never met one before, and she turns up to your interview in a closed Kings Cross bar wearing a hoodie and trackies \u2013 just as she would have done when Melanie Chisholm became Sporty Spice 25 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s still only the little things that nod to the fact she was in one of the biggest girl groups of all time. She speaks quietly, often in an awed whisper, and is not beholden to the propaganda-like version of the Spice Girls\u2019 story that some of her bandmates uphold.\nYet her instantly identifiable scouse accent is unchanged, and she repeatedly recalls memories with an \u201cit\u2019s funny \u2026\u201d, as you might if you had had to figure out how to make sense of becoming farcically famous at the age of 22. The hardest part of that, Chisholm says, was the dissonance between the shy girl she was and the gobby media caricature: \u201cAm I this person I\u2019ve always felt like I am?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWho should I be? Should I be more like they\u2019re saying I am; is that who they want me to be? Is that who I want to be?\u201d\nAt 45, it has taken her a long time to reconcile her anxieties about her identity. She has always sung about her issues with self-acceptance, from her 1999 solo debut, Northern Star, to the new music she is releasing next year. On the demos I hear, she sings about having nothing left to hide and refusing to change for anyone else\u2019s expectations, celebrating differences and working towards self-love. She wrote them with left-field pop artists such as Shura, Rae Morris and Little Boots, producing disco-tinged synth-pop that recalls classic Robyn and the carefree joy of Carly Rae Jepsen. It is her best work since she went it alone 20 years ago.\nSo far, she has released one single, High Heels, written for the queer drag collective Sink the Pink. They have been working closely together this year, touring international Pride celebrations (including one in Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil), where Chisholm has been singing backed by a troupe of queens dressed as the Spice Girls. They have helped her nix her self-doubt, she says.\n\u201cThe drag queens are larger than life and I\u2019m actually quite quiet,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I feel I\u2019m not enough, I\u2019m not outspoken enough, I\u2019m not funny enough, I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d She becomes gently indignant. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018You know what? That\u2019s bullshit. I am enough. I\u2019m doing this incredible thing and I\u2019ve had this incredible career: it\u2019s time to really accept every little bit of me, even the shit bits.\u2019\u201d\nBland self-acceptance is the lingua franca of the modern pop star. But it is poignant to hear Chisholm \u2013 who really is outspoken and funny, with a weapons-grade laugh \u2013 talk about getting there after having watched her struggle for two decades. She was always the shy Spice Girl, in a group dominated by massive personalities. On her 2016 album Version of Me, she sang about being bullied by one of the others and spoke of letting someone \u201cshit on\u201d her. I tell her I assumed it was Mel B, and she nods. Chisholm grew up in a \u201creally quiet household\u201d, never fighting with her mum, so she hated confrontation (although she did start weightlifting after a girl tried to beat her up).\nShe almost got booted out of the band once: in February 1996, five months before they launched, they were invited to the Brit awards. \u201cI got a bit lairy and I told Victoria to fuck off,\u201d she recalls with a guilty laugh. \u201cI upset her, and I was told that if that behaviour ever happened again, then\u201d \u2013 she makes a guillotine gesture. Generally, though, she learned \u201cthat to have an easy life was to stay quiet\u201d. Staying out of the line of fire came naturally, even though it came at a cost to her mental health: Chisholm calls herself a people-pleaser who can always see the other side of an argument. \u201cI\u2019m always the diplomat.\u201d\nOnce the band took off \u2013 the debut single, Wannabe, spent seven weeks as UK No 1 \u2013 their schedule was so intense that Chisholm says she sometimes sees photos of the band and can\u2019t remember where they were taken. \u201cWe had our crazy few years and we didn\u2019t think about the future,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on the radar \u2013 which is a shame, really, because if you did, you\u2019d maybe appreciate the moment a bit more.\u201d\nShe says they were well cared for. The problem was, she didn\u2019t want to be looked after. \u201cI was a grownup, thank you very much,\u201d she says. Instead, she entered \u201csurvival mode\u201d, spending three hours a day in the gym, subsisting on fruit and steamed vegetables. \u201cMy life was out of control and the only thing I could control was how much I ate and how much I exercised,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of my biggest regrets is that there were years when I wouldn\u2019t socialise because I didn\u2019t want to eat in front of people. I just think: \u2018Cor, what a waste of life.\u2019\u201d\nThe Spice Girls\u2019 ubiquity obscures the fact that they only existed as the original five-piece for 22 months, with Geri quitting in May 1998. The other four slogged on through two more tours. Chisholm says it couldn\u2019t have lasted much longer. \u201cWe destroyed ourselves,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were exhausted, we were homesick.\u201d They never formally split \u2013 which, I tell her, was torture for a 10-year-old with a blind faith that they would return. She laughs, apologetically. They never announced the end, because they couldn\u2019t be bothered with the press interest. \u201cWe were burying our heads in the sand. And, to be a bit of a wanker, you\u2019re always a Spice Girl; it never stops.\u201d\nShe did try to stop for a bit. When she went solo, Chisholm bleached and cropped her hair. \u201cI was angry,\u201d she growls, comically. She wanted to be seen as an individual, to escape the band\u2019s legacy. She was shocked by the snobbery when she played the V festival solo and got pelted with apples, urine and, she thinks, Weetabix. \u201cI was a bit naive,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was a baptism of fire. I\u2019m really grateful that I did it, because if you can survive that, you can survive anything.\u201d\nThis was when she started having depression, initially thinking it a symptom of her fame. \u201cI was a Spice Girl,\u201d she says with horrified awe. \u201cFor five minutes, I was one of the most famous people in the world \u2013 how do you deal with that? Everyone treats you differently.\u201d She assumed it would pass. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll just be the happy-go-lucky, normal person I was when I was 19,\u201d she sing-songs. \u201cAnd then, unfortunately, some feelings of depression have come back over the years and I\u2019ve realised, this is part of who I am.\u201d\nShe sought professional help. She still sees a therapist every week and has established a healthier relationship with exercise: a triathlon fiend, she wanted to try out for Team GB, and she is in a pre-Christmas pull-up competition: she can do five, but wants to get to 10. She rubbishes the idea that women who love exercise must be unhappy with their bodies. \u201cI love trying to better myself, trying to be faster, stronger, hold a note for longer,\u201d she rhapsodises. Having her daughter, 10 years ago, helped, too. (The father was property developer Thomas Starr; they split in 2012.) \u201cIt made me realise the things I would sometimes allow to happen to me, I would not have happen to her. I often feel like she\u2019s my teacher. She\u2019s given me a lot more courage to treat myself better.\u201d\nNevertheless, at the end of 2018, with the Spice Girls reunion tour looming, Chisholm was feeling anxious about returning to their complicated dynamic. Her worries were dispelled \u201c100%\u201d, she says. \u201cIt was like a fairytale. We wanted to do the Spice Girls show to end all Spice Girls shows: nostalgic but modern, a celebration, bringing everybody together.\u201d She cackles. \u201cWe also wanted to give everyone a really fun night out because we\u2019re all so fucking over Brexit.\u201d\nThe reunion was a product of a \u201crare moment when we all agreed\u201d \u2013 Chisholm had refused a mooted reunion for Wannabe\u2019s 20th anniversary in 2016. Mel B has been the most persistent about rebooting the band, adding to the sense that it plays a bigger role in some of their lives than others. Last year, Brown\u2019s memoir detailed her experience of an abusive marriage, and explained how work offered a refuge. Her ex-husband denied any physical abuse.\nDid reuniting ever feel like a responsibility to a friend? \u201cWhat happened to Melanie was so horrific,\u201d Chisholm says. \u201cThere were quite a few tears shed over the time we spent together because we hadn\u2019t been together day after day for a long time. To rekindle those friendships and remember the things we love about each other, it was hard.\u201d\nShe stares across the empty bar and brings up Brown\u2019s marriage. \u201cI feel \u2013 and she knows this \u2013 I feel shit that I wasn\u2019t more determined to intervene,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what can you do? We\u2019re all grownups. I couldn\u2019t wade in there and say: \u2018I think your husband\u2019s a prick, I want to take you away.\u2019 Melanie and I did fall out about it. And I didn\u2019t handle it very well. It was difficult and she couldn\u2019t leave that situation until she was ready. Thank God nothing happened to her. You do feel shit that you didn\u2019t do more.\u201d\nWhile she says \u2013 contrary to comments from Mel B and Emma \u2013 there won\u2019t be new music, Chisholm would love to do more shows, playing territories the band never visited. \u201cI\u2019d do it at the drop of a hat,\u201d she says. I tell her that the Guardian rarely reports on rumoured reunions, but that we often make an exception for the Spice Girls owing to the mania around their existence. Why are we still so obsessed by them? She laughs. \u201cIt was quite unusual for a female band to be that successful \u2013 and not only successful musically; it was a very cultural movement.\u201d Plus, we are living in a period of nostalgia for 90s Britain. \u201cBritish music was ruling the world. Even politically, things were on the up. Or we thought so.\u201d And the Spice Girls, she says, are like an ongoing soap opera.\nThe response to this year\u2019s tour \u2013 and admiration from a generation of young artists including Billie Eilish \u2013 renewed Chisholm\u2019s solo ambitions. Her previous albums flew under the radar, but the partnership with Sink the Pink and the hiring of a snazzy new PR company suggest someone who wants to make a bit of a splash again. She agrees. When her manager of 18 years retired, Chisholm realised she wanted to speed up. She hired a new team, who gave her a \u201ckick up the bum\u201d, and sought out exciting young writers and producers, which she says has produced a high strike rate of good material.\nShe knows she is a \u201cmature\u201d pop artist, and tempers her expectations accordingly, relishing the opportunity to play stadiums with the band and dedicated audiences on her own. \u201cEven Spice Girls shows in the 90s, I\u2019ve never experienced the reactions we got this summer,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of arenas \u2013 good job, innit?!\u201d She unleashes a filthy laugh. \u201cBut I love clubs. How lucky that I can do that.\u201d\nI hope people give her great new music a chance, especially since Chisholm\u2019s work feels so in sync with 2019. She has been talking about her mental health for nearly 20 years, and her work with Sink the Pink feels like genuine advocacy. She marvels at the \u201cprivilege\u201d of spending time in queer and non-binary communities, and is a vocal transgender ally. \u201cI mean, Jesus Christ, can you imagine growing up feeling like you\u2019re in the wrong body?\u201d she says. She\u2019s shocked by the prevalence of transphobia in British culture and sport. \u201cWe have to move on,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cThings change. Thank goodness people are able to be who they truly feel they are rather than living miserable lives or secret lives. It\u2019s something that has to be acknowledged and addressed.\u201d\nShe knows what it\u2019s like to make up lost ground. \u201cI had a hard time in my early 30s. Sometimes I think, did I miss my opportunity of being in my prime? Was it wasted?\u201d Being in her 40s \u201cfeels like a new opportunity for me to really go for it again, and just enjoy it,\u201d she says. And off she goes to get the tube, resolutely human.\nMelanie C\u2019s single High Heels is out now on Red Girl",

        "content": "Researchers draw link between weak regulation of travel industry and rising levels of sex tourism and online sexual crime\nWeak laws regulating sexual exploitation in travel and tourism are turning the African continent into a \u201cnew frontier for child sexual exploitation\u201d, according to a new report.\nThe study, by the African Child Policy Forum, sheds light on the continued rise of child sexual exploitation, including new forms such as \u201ctourism marriages\u201d and cybersex.\nThe travel and tourism sector is facilitating \u201csexual services\u201d involving children within entertainment amenities, the report found, citing the rise of massage parlours and upscale restaurants targeted at foreign customers in Africa.\nIn Egypt, \u201ctourism marriages\u201d between young girls and male tourists were reported, predominantly among families from poorer backgrounds, who received financial payments for providing their daughters.\nThe report pointed to inadequate law enforcement in the travel and tourism sectors, and weak internet regulation, as contributory factors in the rise of child sexual exploitation in Africa.\nIn Senegal, the study found online sexual exploitation has resulted in \u201cyoung girls being recruited into pornographic films and bestiality\u201d.\nShimelis Tsegaye, one of the authors of the report, said: \u201cVery few African countries have laws criminalising online sexual crimes, and those that do frequently fail to enforce them adequately. Many children are unsafe even within their own homes.\n\u201cGrooming, sexting, sexual extortion and live streaming of child sexual abuse \u2013 sometimes with the connivance of parents \u2013 is made possible because very few African countries have laws to protect children online.\u201d\nIn Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and Zimbabwe, 22-38% of girls and 9\u201317% of boys have experienced sexual violence.\nThe report found that programmes set up to fight against child sex exploitation often ignore or fail to include male victims. Patriarchal attitudes mean boys are not categorised as victims of sexual exploitation, said the researchers, and are also less likely to report sexual exploitation. As a result, they often remain hidden from statistics, the report said.\nThis propagates inter-generational patterns of violence. \u201cTwo out of three boys who experienced sexual violence in childhood [are] more likely to perpetrate sexual violence against a partner in adulthood,\u201d said the report.\nChildren with disabilities are among those most vulnerable to sexual exploitation. The absence of sexual and reproductive education and health services in accessible formats has put disabled children and adolescents at greater risk of manipulation.\n\u201cSexual exploitation among children with disabilities goes unreported because of the mistaken belief that children with disabilities are asexual and cannot understand their own bodies,\u201d the study said. In Cameroon and Senegal, more than half the children with disabilities who reported sexual exploitation had been raped.\n\u201cProgress on tackling child sexual exploitation remains woefully slow and inadequate,\u201d said Dr Assefa Bequele, the African Child Policy Forum\u2019sexecutive director.\n\u201cAfrican governments must urgently pass laws that explicitly define and prohibit sexual exploitation, that recognise boys as victims of sexual exploitation, and that prohibit child sex tourism and online exploitation.\u201d",

The group said investment would be in partnership with suppliers and directed towards parts of its supply chain where converting to renewable energy was more difficult \u2013 such as the textile industry, ceramics and glass production.\nThe second tranche will be aimed at removing and storing carbon through reforestation and responsible forest management. Ikea said it was considering a variety of global regions for reforestation projects.\nThe group statement said: \u201cIt is most likely that we will put an emphasis on projects in tropical and subtropical regions. This is because there is a vast amount of degraded land in need of reforestation, and forests in these regions grow faster making it possible to remove more carbon from the atmosphere.\u201d\nIngka Group, which has previously laid out plans to spend at least \u20ac3bn on sustainability investments, said this week that since 2009, it had pumped close to \u20ac2.5bn into renewable energy. The group now owns 534 wind turbines and 715,000 solar panels in 14 countries as well as a further 920,000 solar panels on store rooftops.\nThe company, which operates 374 Ikea stores in 30 countries, has also invested in over 26,000 hectares of forest land, mostly in the US and Lithuania, taking its total ownership of responsibly managed forests to 208,700 hectares (about 2,000sq km) in five countries.\nThe group has also invested in a plastics recycling plant, textile and mattress recycling and is trialling the sale of used, patched-up furniture in the UK as part of efforts to become more environmentally friendly.\nThe investments have put Ingka Group on track to produce as much energy from renewable sources as consumed in its operations by next year.\n\u201cWe believe that the best way to minimise our climate impact and to contribute to limiting climate change to 1.5\u00b0C is mainly by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 but we also need to remove existing carbon from the atmosphere. We can make a positive difference through our integrated supply chain, our global presence and our forest and climate expertise,\u201d said Lena Pripp-Kovac, chief sustainability officer of Inter Ikea Group.",

        "content": "Civilian casualties are mounting as opposing sides deploy cheap Turkish and Chinese-made aircraft \nThe use of lethal drones was once an area dominated by the US, but has spread rapidly, drawing in new conflicts and causing more civilian casualties as warfare is revolutionised.\nThe principal battleground is Libya, where both sides in the ongoing civil war are trying to gain air superiority with cheap Chinese-made craft run by the United Arab Emirates on one side, and equally inexpensive Turkish-made drones on the other.\n\u201cLibya is ground zero for drone wars,\u201d said Chris Cole, who runs the Drone Wars research group. \u201cA complex network of countries are involved and nobody is precisely sure who is doing what.\u201d\nThe conflict pits the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar, the 76-year-old military strongman who controls Benghazi and much of the east of the country, against the forces of the rival Government of National Accord (GNA), which holds the capital, Tripoli.\nMore than 1,000 people have already been killed in the fighting with 120,000 displaced, according to UN estimates. In April, Haftar launched a new offensive, attacking Tripoli and advancing into the south-west of the country. Since, there have been more than 900 drone missions, the UN estimates.\nThe use of drones intensified when, after rapid early gains, Haftar\u2019s forces were stalled by resistance from a coalition of militias fighting for the GNA. This led to an increasing reliance on air power to gain a tactical advantage in what had become a stalemate and to avoid further military casualties, experts say.\nHaftar is supported by Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The UAE operates a handful of Chinese-made Wing Loong drones, with an estimated cost of $1m-$2m (\u00a3800,000-\u00a31.5m), a fraction of the price of a US-made Reaper, where the entry level price is about $15m.\nThe GNA, recognised by the UN as the legitimate government of Libya, is backed by Qatar and the fast-emerging drone power Turkey, which has supplied its Bayraktar TB2 drones in at least three waves this year.\nIn August, UAE-operated Chinese drones fighting for Haftar were blamed for a double strike targeting a town hall meeting in south-western Libya that killed at least 45 people.\nUsing a controversial \u201cdouble tap\u201d technique pioneered by the US, the second strike came a few minutes later to target first responders, in the belief they would be connected to the original targets. Guests at a nearby wedding who had come to help were among those killed.\nThe death toll, which included many children, represents one of the largest single loss of civilian life since conflict began in 2011 after the fall of the dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\nJalel Harchaoui, an expert at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, said that in recent months Haftar had switched to using cheaper drones after he had abandoned hope of a successful conventional military attack on Tripoli \u2013 they were the ideal weapons for a drawn-out campaign aimed at undermining the morale of opponents.\n\u201cAir power is playing a bigger role and drones are very useful. We have seen a greater tendency to go after soft targets. Slowly but surely there is a higher tolerance for civilian casualties and there has been no real international condemnation,\u201d Harchaoui said.\nThere have been dozens of smaller-scale strikes in recent months, including one that hit a riding club close to the UN compound in Tripoli in early October, injuring several children. Most have been blamed on Haftar\u2019s forces, who have been using drones to destroy the GNA\u2019s Turkish-made aerial vehicles on the ground.\nComplicating the picture further, the US periodically conducts its own drone strikes aimed at Isis-affiliated groups in the south of the country. Four recently disclosed strikes were claimed to have killed 43 militants in late September, launched from bases in Italy and Niger.\nIn November last year, Tuareg people living in the south of the country claimed a US drone strike had killed 11 civilians. But Washington said terrorists had been targeted and it believed no civilians were killed.\nThe military effectiveness of the GNA\u2019s Bayraktur TB2 drones has been proven in Ankara\u2019s long-running battle with the separatist PKK in the south-east of Turkey, which has spilled over into Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria, where they have been involved in lethal strikes.\nSuch is Turkey\u2019s success that it has rapidly become a major exporter of medium-range drones, meeting a demand because the US remains unwilling to allow countries in the conflict-torn Middle East to buy its Reaper drones.\nThe GNA bought 20 TB2 drones from Turkey in the summer, although some replaced drones knocked out by the LNA. Ankara also struck a deal to sell six TB2s to Qatar in 2018 and this year 12 were sold to Ukraine.\nAnalysts say that in Libya, the deadly air war has been prolonged by the use of the relatively inexpensive drones. Jennifer Gibson, from the human rights charity Reprieve, adds that a long history of secrecy around drone use by the US and its allies has created an increasingly amoral environment around their use.\n\u201cNew users of drones do not feel any great obligation to admit what they have done, because a precedent for non-disclosure has already been set,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "UK-based manufacturer supplied crucial missile component to Turkish drone-maker during development stage\nTurkey was able to circumvent a US export ban on killer drones with the help of a missile component first developed in the UK, allowing Ankara to become an emerging power in the lethal technology, which experts warn is dangerously proliferating.\nThe vital assistance from a factory in Brighton has helped Turkey on its way to become the second biggest user of armed drones in the world \u2013 one of a number of countries emulating methods first used by the US in its \u201cwar on terror\u201d.\nTurkish Bayraktar TB2 drones were heavily used in Ankara\u2019s three operations to date against Kurdish-led forces in Syria, responsible for the killing of 449 individuals in one of them, amounting to a fifth of the officially declared fatalities.\nThey have also been used to kill what Turkey\u2019s defence ministry said were \u201cfive PKK terrorists\u201d across the border in Iraq this month, imitating the extraterritorial strikes pioneered by the US in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.\nBut while the armed Bayraktar TB2 drones are manufactured by a Turkish company, they could not have been developed without the Hornet missile rack, which was devised and supplied by EDO MBM Technology, located on the outskirts of Brighton, somewhere around 2015.\nAn article in Jane\u2019s Defence Review from May 2016 shows the Hornet was supplied to the Bayraktar TB2\u2019s manufacturer Baykar at the crucial initial development stage. The Turkish company went on to develop its own missile racks.\nFour years on, Turkey\u2019s security forces run a fleet of 86 armed TB2s and the country is a fast emerging player in drone usage worldwide, a field that was dominated by the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK and Israel until three or four four years ago.\nBaykar did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the role UK technology played in developing the TB2. After publication, Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar, Baykar\u2019s chief technical officer, said on Twitter that Baykar had not purchased the Hornet rack from EDO MBM Technology and that it had designed its own \u201cmuch more advanced model at an affordable cost\u201d.\nChris Cole, the director of Drone Wars UK, said: \u201cWhat we are seeing is countries like Turkey becoming a major player in drone usage, which is, like the US, prepared to engage in targeted killing outside its own borders.\u201d\nToday the field is awash with new manufacturers, including China as well as Turkey, and new buyers, including the United Arab Emirates, which has been behind their deployment in the ongoing Libyan civil war, supporting rebels led by Gen Khalifa Haftar.\nTurkish TB2 drones, meanwhile, have been used in response by their opponents, the internationally recognised government based in Tripoli \u2013 in a conflict in which dozens of people have been killed by drone strikes.\nThe Turkish government\u2019s goal had long been to deploy drones against the Kurdish PKK separatists who have been engaged in a long-running violent insurgency in the south-east of the country, near its borders with Syria and Iraq.\nA US diplomatic cable from 2009, part of the WikiLeaks disclosures, written by the country\u2019s then ambassador to Turkey, James Jeffrey, reports: \u201cTurkey seeks to acquire, on an urgent basis, its own UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle, ie a drone] capability to be able to continue anti-PKK ops without US assistance.\u201d\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was Turkey\u2019s prime minister at the time, led several attempts to buy Predator drones from the US, but these were rebuffed by Congress, which had to approve the sales, forcing Ankara into an alternative approach.\nTurkey then began its own development programmes, in large part masterminded by Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar, an ambitious former MIT PhD student, who is now married to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s youngest daughter, S\u00fcmeyye.\nThe key breakthrough came in December 2015, when Bayraktar successfully test-fired a rocket from its TB2 drone for the first time.\nFiring the rocket required the help of the Hornet system, a \u201ccarriage system\u201d supplied to Baykar and designed for what the parent company of EDO MBM calls \u201cmicro munitions\u201d \u2013 small, light bombs, designed to avoid weighing down a drone, that are able to make more targeted deadly strikes.\nIt is a sophisticated piece of equipment, described by some experts as \u201cthe intelligent hand\u201d that ensures that munitions fired from a drone are released properly away from the drone and onto the target coordinates specified.\nPatents were first filed by EDO in the UK in 2014 and in the EU and Turkey a year later, as shown in a dossier of evidence collected by Ceri Gibbons, a researcher with the Brighton Against the Arms Trade campaign group, which has been verified by the Guardian.\nEDO MBM is owned by the US company L3 Harris, the world\u2019s sixth-largest defence contractor. But because EDO MBM is located in the UK it is subject to British and not US arms regulations, meaning it could legally export the critical bomb rack.\nNeither L3 Harris nor Baykar would comment on their technology or relationship.\nBarry Gardiner, Labour\u2019s international trade spokesman, said he was concerned about UK arms sales to Turkey. The party would make \u201croot and branch reforms to arms export controls to ensure British made weapons are not used to kill innocent civilians\u201d, he added.\nThe Bayraktar TB2 drone has revolutionised Ankara\u2019s operations against the PKK in south-east Turkey and in northern Iraq, severely limiting the group\u2019s movements. Capable of 24-hour flights at an altitude of 7,300 metres and carrying a payload of 150kg, the TB2 is well-armed and is a source of Turkish national pride.\nVideo footage of a TB2 destroying a huge portrait of the PKK founder, Abdullah \u00d6calan, on Darmiq mountain near Afrin was widely celebrated across the country \u2013 so much so that it even led to the creation of a smartphone game where the player can operate an armed drone in Afrin, a Kurdish region in Syria until Turkey occupied it in 2018.",

        "content": "Each episode of podcast based on his bestselling book is built on an interview with a subject from the book, combined with audio recorded in real time during the Weinstein investigation\nRonan Farrow\u2019s work helped spawn #MeToo, a social movement that fundamentally changed how we talk about sexual harassment and rape, and led to concrete changes in the way allegations are investigated across the world.\nBut the investigative reporter is quick to say that none of it would have been possible without his sources: the victims who shared their stories despite the emotional cost and steep personal and professional risks.\nMany of those women have chosen to speak again \u2013 and this time you can hear their voices. On Tuesday, Farrow launched a podcast based on his bestselling book Catch and Kill, which told how his investigation of Harvey Weinstein unfolded in the face of an army of lawyers and spies wielded by the media mogul.\nProduced by Pineapple Street Studios, the team behind Missing Richard Simmons, The Clearing and other well-known podcasts, each episode of the Catch and Kill podcast is built around an interview with a subject from the book, combined with audio recorded in real time during the initial investigation.\nFarrow shared a Pulitzer prize for breaking the Weinstein story but when he started interviewing victims in the case, many were guarded. When he returned to interview them for the podcast, he found there had been a shift.\n\u201cThe podcast was a wonderful opportunity to have conversations that were much more direct and much more frank,\u201d Farrow told the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re very raw, they\u2019re very emotional, they\u2019re very real. And I\u2019ve been very grateful for how the people I\u2019ve interviewed for this have opened up.\u201d\nFarrow said the podcast idea came early. Like many investigative reporters he records as much as he can. He had also obtained police recordings of Weinstein. So he had a \u201chuge reservoir of raw audio material\u201d that now serves as a key part of the podcast, providing what he called \u201cpops of sound\u201d and real-time dialogue that \u201ctransport you into the events as they happen\u201d.\nSome of the dialogue promises to be both dramatic and still all too relevant. Farrow began his investigation of Weinstein when he was a reporter at NBC News. He claims he was repeatedly stymied by a network unwilling to pursue the story.\nIn his book, Farrow alleges that NBC execs killed the Weinstein investigation because they feared it would make them vulnerable to sexual harassment issues closer to home: allegations of rape and sexual harassment against the former Today anchor Matt Lauer, which had yet to become public.\nIn the lead-up to publication of Catch and Kill, the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, called Farrow\u2019s work a \u201csmear\u201d. He failed to convince many of his own staff. MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes have called for an independent investigation and last month a group of NBC digital employees cited discontent with the handling of the issue as one of the reasons they are seeking to form a union.\nAt least one episode of the podcast may be of interest to such organizers: Farrow says it will feature conversations with his producer Rich McHugh as frustration with their bosses grew.\n\u201cWe recorded hours of our conversations in real time as the story was getting killed by our network executives,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cAnd you can hear the real moments about reacting to those pieces of news and how we reacted in the moment.\u201d\nThe podcast will include interviews with a broad cast from Farrow\u2019s book, including behind-the-scenes actors like factcheckers and lawyers as well as those in the spotlight, like Ambra Gutierrez, who describes the police sting operation she participated in to ensnare Weinstein. In the first episode, Farrow interviews Igor Ostrovskiy, an operative who was hired to spy on him, only to end up a whistleblower and a source.\nAnother episode will feature an interview with a woman who was not ready to go on the record for Farrow\u2019s initial reporting: Weinstein\u2019s former assistant Rowena Chiu, who eventually told her story in a New York Times column. Farrow said Chiu\u2019s retelling of her struggle over whether to come forward made her important to include.\n\u201cI think that both the sources who spoke and the sources who didn\u2019t can teach us about just how high the stakes are when someone tries to out the truth on a subject like this,\u201d he said, \u201cand confront a person as powerful as some of the people that I report on in Catch and Kill. And by hearing directly from them about the effect it had on their lives, I hope it can inspire more compassion.\u201d\nAsked to assess the impact of his work, Farrow points to shifts in journalism and culture as well as moves by state legislatures \u2013 and parliament in the UK \u2013 to pass laws changing how non-disclosure agreements are applied in cases of sexual violence.\nBut he quickly turns back to the women whose decisions to come forward made his reporting possible, and whose voices are the foundation for his new project.\n\u201cI think there are still good days and bad days for a lot of these sources and particularly ones who went through a great deal of trauma, and none of this is easy and there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI come away from both the book and the podcast feeling that the fight for the free flow of information about these topics is only just beginning, but also feeling very galvanized and optimistic because these sources, that you will get to know if you listen to this podcast, show absolutely no signs of backing down or shutting up.\u201d\nThe Catch and Kill Podcast is available on Radio.com, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and all other podcast platforms",

        "content": "The PM also acknowledged he misled the House on Wednesday by incorrectly attributing a comment about an investigation into Julia Gillard\nScott Morrison has rebuffed an invitation by Labor to release any officials\u2019 notes of his conversation with the New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller, and insisted there was nothing inappropriate about approaching the police chief while he was investigating the conduct of one of his ministers, Angus Taylor.\nMorrison mocked Labor for pursuing the propriety of the call in question time on Wednesday, declaring no objections were raised by the opposition on Tuesday when he flagged his plan to make contact with Fuller. The prime minister also accused Labor of double standards, declaring both Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten faced police probes, and did not vacate their posts.\nBut Morrison ran into trouble later on Wednesday when it emerged he had misled the House by incorrectly attributing a comment about the historical police investigation into Gillard to the detective handling her matter, when the comment had been made by Sydney talkback radio host Ben Fordham.\nMorrison, who had left Canberra for the evening, corrected the record by writing to the Speaker, Tony Smith, acknowledging the botched attribution. Labor is demanding that the prime minister correct his mistake in person on Thursday morning. The government moved to shut down the opposition\u2019s vociferous objections in parliament on Wednesday night, gagging motion after motion.\nThe Taylor controversy dominated federal parliament on Wednesday. The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, ratcheted up political pressure earlier in the day, declaring he would not have phoned the New South Wales police commissioner to check the status of an investigation into the origins of an altered document.\nTurnbull raised the political stakes by telling Sky News he was certain the conversation his successor had with Fuller about the Taylor investigation was \u201cinnocuous, but it would have been much better if it had not been made, because it is really, it is vitally important that that inquiry that is being conducted by the NSW police \u2013 like every inquiry they undertake \u2013 is seen to be conducted entirely free of political influence. Being blunt about it \u2013 it is a call I would not have made.\u201d\nAs well as attempting to fend off Labor\u2019s sustained attack about the propriety of the call to Fuller in question time, Morrison also shrugged off the pointed criticism from Turnbull. \u201cOnly those in possession of all of the facts ... can make any real judgment about the call I made,\u201d Morrison said.\nThe Labor leader Anthony Albanese asked Morrison whether he had sought advice from officials before speaking to Fuller, and whether note takers had been present. Morrison said the \u201cnormal arrangements applied for those calls, and the normal processes apply for accessing that information in relation to those matters\u201d.\nAs Labor doubled down, Morrison defaulted to mockery, asking whether Albanese thought he he was going to call the parking infringements officer at the Sutherland police station, the water police or the dog squad, or perhaps the commander of the police band?\nAlbanese asked why Morrison thought the normal rules of accountability did not apply to him. The prime minister said he thought that was more of a \u201csmear\u201d than a question, and he accused the Labor leader of \u201csulking\u201d.\nNSW police confirmed that just before question time on Tuesday they had launched an investigation into the origins of an altered city council document Taylor used to attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. The document contained incorrect information about council travel. Taylor has apologised to the lord mayor.\nWith Labor insisting that Taylor should step aside for the duration of the police investigation, Morrison spoke after question time to Fuller and then made a brief statement in the chamber saying there was no need to take action against Taylor at this time.\nHe said Fuller had conveyed to him that the matters under investigation were \u201cbased only on the allegations referred by the shadow attorney general\u201d.\nIn an interview in 2018 the NSW commissioner told Sydney\u2019s 2GB radio station he used to be Morrison\u2019s neighbour, and that the prime minister had collected his bins when he went away.\n\u201cHe was the treasurer at the time,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cHe did tell me recently that he\u2019s the prime minister now, and that should be Josh Frydenberg\u2019s job, but he won\u2019t take my calls! He\u2019s a neighbour of mine and I do wish him well \u2013 he\u2019s a very good neighbour.\u201d\nWhile Morrison described Fuller in 2018 as a neighbour and a \u201cgood bloke\u201d the police chief recanted the bin story on Wednesday, telling reporters: \u201cFrom my perspective that was just a joke. Of course he has never brought my bins in\u201d.\nThe NSW police commissioner said he did not have a personal relationship with Morrison and the conversation they had on Tuesday was uncontroversial. \u201cThe prime minister didn\u2019t ask me any questions that were inappropriate\u201d.\nThe police chief said he told the prime minister the investigation would be concluded \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, these types of investigations can consume an enormous amount of resources from New South Wales police and they are a great diverter of my time,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cThere is a whole range of reasons why I want the matter finished quickly but professionally and many of those are selfish\u201d.\nAhead of question time, Albanese, declared it was \u201cpretty unusual\u201d for the prime minister to ring a police commissioner when an investigation was under way.\n\u201cFor the prime minister to ring the police commissioner \u2013 not in the national interest, in his personal interest, to defend his government when he has an interest, clearly, in not having a minister step aside \u2013 I found it quite breathtaking when the prime minister came into the parliament yesterday and, instead of announcing that the minister would step aside, he did the opposite,\u201d Albanese said.\nHe said Morrison\u2019s job was to \u201cact in the national interest when he talks to authorities, not in his own personal interest, and I found it pretty unprecedented, frankly, that he would suggest that there had been a discussion about details of an investigation that was only launched hours beforehand\u201d.\nTaylor has said repeatedly, including in parliament on Tuesday, that neither he, nor \u201cany members of my staff, altered the [council] documents in question\u201d. The minister says he will cooperate with the police investigation.\nWhile signalling cooperation, Morrison told parliament on Tuesday it was likely that the police inquiry would come to naught because Labor made referrals to the police frequently, and \u201cthey\u2019ve all ended up going absolutely nowhere at the end of the day\u201d.\nThe shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, wrote to the state police in late October requesting that Fuller investigate whether someone had \u201cmade a false document with the intention\u201d of inducing journalists at the Daily Telegraph to accept it as genuine for the purpose of influencing the \u201cLord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, and other City of Sydney Councillors in the exercise of their public duties\u201d.\nDreyfus also asked police to examine whether an offence had been committed \u201con the basis that Mr Taylor or one or more individuals from Mr Taylor\u2019s office\u201d knew or believed an offence had been committed but failed to bring it to the attention of police.\nHe said an article in the Daily Telegraph on 30 September 2019 \u201cregarding travel expenditure by the City of Sydney Council was based on a forged version of the Council\u2019s annual report\u201d.\n\u201cThat forgery, which dramatically overstated the council\u2019s annual travel costs, was allegedly provided to the newspaper by the office of the minister for energy and emissions reduction, Mr Angus Taylor.\u201d\nTaylor has flatly rejected the allegations and dismissed them as a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d.",

        "content": "Ambitious policies, political will and long-term thinking push forward council\u2019s plan to become UK\u2019s first carbon-neutral city\nNottingham city council: Nottingham \u2013 carbon neutral by 2028\nWhen Nottingham city council announced in January that it intended to become the UK\u2019s first carbon-neutral city by 2028, it was the latest step in years of ambitious, innovative and forward-thinking environmental policymaking that has already yielded breathtaking results.\nIt met its 2020 target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 26% four years early; more than 40% of all journeys in Nottingham are made on public transport and solar panels have been installed on more than 4,000 council houses.\nEnergy consumption of council buildings has been cut by 39% and it is on track to generate 20% of its energy from low-carbon sources by next year.\nAnd last year the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded that the city\u2019s air pollution had fallen so much that a Clean Air Zone was not needed.\nThe council\u2019s vision and tenacity was recognised on Tuesday night when it was named the overall winner in the Guardian\u2019s Public Service Awards.\n\u201cThis has been the year when argument over the climate crisis finally ended and the imperative for radical action became widely understood,\u201d says the Guardian\u2019s public services editor, David Brindle.\n\u201cMany public services are still barely off the starting blocks in the race to tackle the emergency, but Nottingham has shown what can be done through inspired leadership and gritty determination,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cIn scrutinising every aspect of its own practice, and taking bold steps to shape behaviour in the wider community, the city council has truly set the bar for excellence in how public agencies must respond to the threat to the planet.\u201d\nMaking the carbon neutral commitment was only possible, says Sally Longford, the Labour council\u2019s deputy leader and portfolio holder for energy and environment, because of the work that had gone before \u2013 especially the efforts of her predecessor in the environment role, councillor Alan Clark, who died in 2017. \u201cHe was determined to make progress and drove forward quite a lot of the early development,\u201d says Longford. \u201cWe got a lot of stick over the years. People thought we were anti-car, because we introduced various schemes to try and reduce car usage and congestion.\u201d\nBut it has paid off. \u201cWhen I was talking to the officers about how far we could push this they were confident we could go further than other councils because of all the work we\u2019d already done.\u201d\nOne policy in particular, its workplace parking levy (WPL), was a \u201cgamechanger\u201d according to Longford.\nIntroduced in 2012, the WPL is aimed at employers providing 11 or more commuter parking spaces, with an annual rate of \u00a3415 per space. It is still the only such scheme in the UK and has not only tackled congestion and pollution but netted the council \u00a361m for improving and \u201cgreening\u201d public transport. That money has helped with the redevelopment of Nottingham station, an expansion of the tram network that runs on green electricity from the council\u2019s own energy company, and the council\u2019s fleet of 58 electric buses that has reduced carbon emissions by more than 1,050 tonnes.\n\u201cWe have a positive attitude to these things because they pay for themselves,\u201d says Longford. \u201cWe\u2019re putting solar panels on anything that doesn\u2019t move, really, because it saves us money in the long run and helps support other work we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nThe energy and transport teams have won funding from central government, Europe and other sources, and the savings the energy team generates means it actually makes a profit for the council that can be used to cross-subsidise crucial departments such as children\u2019s services.\nNext year the council will be going out across the city to talk about what it is doing. \u201cWe have a lot of people who live in quite deprived circumstances and it\u2019s not their highest priority,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to pay their bills and feed their families, but they will also be the people who will be the least able to cope in warmer climates. We have a duty to help people in all parts of the city adapt and find ways to improve their lifestyle.\u201d\nNottingham\u2019s policies have not only benefited the environment but have also made a difference to people\u2019s lives, says Longford. \u201cA lot of quite hard decisions were made but people have been brave enough to give it a go. I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nMayfield and Easthouses Development Trust: River Esk cleanup project\n\u201cWhat has wings and spends most of its lifetime in the River Esk?\u201d volunteer Joy Godfrey asks in the first video she made with the Mayfield and Easthouses Development Trust to highlight sewage pollution near Dalkeith, Midlothian, caused in part by increased heavy rainfall.\n\u201cA sanitary towel,\u201d she answers with a grimace, fishing one out of the water.\nWithin a week, the film, in which Godfrey also shows off slimy clumps of blackened wet wipes, tampons and a condom, had been viewed 2,000 times. A second film, in the Mary Burn tributary, quickly attracted the attention of the local member of the Scottish parliament. The campaign eventually led to a cleanup operation that saw Scottish Water remove more than 3,000 bin bags of sewage debris.\nGodfrey and the trust have continued to monitor the waterways and press for further action, and are working to build public awareness of good flushing habits \u2013 part of the current problem is that the sewers were not designed for wrongly-flushed sanitary products. Meanwhile, the issue of sewage pollution has been raised in the Scottish and Westminster parliaments.\n\u201cIn June 2018 just about every other rock was covered with a wet wipe,\u201d Godfrey says of the part of the river near her house that inspired her action. \u201cIt really stank \u2013 it just smelled dirty and rotten.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about being affected by a problem and speaking from there that gives you power. To go into the river, hold these things and say \u2018this is disgusting\u2019 is much more effective than standing on the bank.\u201d\nNorfolk county council: Norfolk assistance scheme\nNorfolk county council\u2019s Norfolk assistance scheme used to provide new white goods and vital household items such as beds and sofas to individuals and families in crisis. In 2017-18, the average cost was \u00a3755.\nUnder the scheme\u2019s new reuse development project, applicants now get quality reused items from partners including charities the Benjamin Foundation and Emmaus Norfolk and Waveney instead. This more than halves the average award cost and means the scheme, which last year made 1,118 awards, can help more people while also supporting local charities and reducing the burden on landfill.\nThe scheme went live in July, after pilots that ran from December 2018 showed the new average award was just \u00a3308.\nAnother benefit is that people are now getting higher quality furniture, explains one of the scheme\u2019s officers, Christina Campbell. \u201c[Before] we had to go to the low end of the market, and a lot of those items didn\u2019t have a long shelf life, so they would end up in landfill,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we supply better quality items they\u2019ve got a lot more life in them.\u201d\nThe new system also empowers applicants by allowing them to decide how to spend their award. At Emmaus there\u2019s a dedicated team for the system, which gives roles to formerly homeless volunteers who have been supported by the charity.\n\u201cNow applicants are entitled to go and choose the items, they can have their own tastes,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d",

Subscribe here\nReporters from the Guardian and Observer and many other publications outside China have spent well over a year trying to shed light on what is happening to Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, in China\u2019s north-west. Following our previous reporting about mass disappearances and the systematic destruction of mosques in the region, perhaps the most dramatic expos\u00e9 of the Chinese state\u2019s actions comes in the China cables, a cache of classified government papers obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and shared with the Guardian and 16 other media partners. The China cables show precisely the internal workings of a vast chain of Chinese internment camps used to hold at least a million people from the nation\u2019s Muslim minorities. In this week\u2019s cover story our reporters Emma Graham-Harrison and Juliette Garside explain the significance of the leak, dissect the documents and tell the story of one Uighur man\u2019s detention. \n  Britain\u2019s second general election in just over two years is quickly approaching and last week the two main party leaders scrapped on TV before revealing their manifestos for government. Observer political editor Toby Helm heads to the ultra-tight marginal of Norwich North to gauge the mood on the ground, while Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott compares and contrasts Labour\u2019s grand economic vision with the Conservatives\u2019 cautious plans.\n  The Trump impeachment hearings have enthralled viewers in the US and beyond. The Guardian\u2019s US team have been working tirelessly to cover proceedings and this week we feature DC bureau chief David Smith\u2019s report on the role that immigrant Americans \u2013 including Alexander Vindman, Fiona Hill and Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 have played in this political spectacular. \nWe also feature a stunning collection of murals from a Baghdad, where the air is revolutionary; Verna Yu analyses Hong Kong\u2019s huge vote towards democracy in its local elections; there\u2019s more from Tom Phillips on the post-Morales fall out in Bolivia; Eleanor Ainge Roy reports on the Grace Millane murder trial that shocked New Zealand and Leyland Cecco looks at Justin Trudeau\u2019s attempts to mend fences with western Canada.\nThere are also great features on the vaping health scare and what a constant stream of home deliveries means for the way we live.

The deal values the business at $4.8bn (\u00a33.74bn), establishing it as one of the most valuable sports companies in the world.\nIt puts CFG\u2019s value more than $1bn ahead of the $3.81bn worth attributed to Manchester United by Forbes in July. At that point City were valued at $2.69bn by Forbes and the Dallas Cowboys topped its list at $5bn. In September Forbes increased the Cowboys\u2019 value to $5.5bn.\nA CFG statement said the investment from Silver Lake would be used to \u201cfund international business growth opportunities and develop further CFG technology and infrastructure assets\u201d. Silver Lake describes itself as a global leader in technology investing.\nSheikh Mansour is still the majority shareholder, owning 77% (down from around 87%), while 12% is held by a Chinese consortium, headed up by conglomerate CMC Inc, which previously had around 13%.\nKhaldoon al-Mubarak, the CFG chairman, said: \u201cWe and Silver Lake share the strong belief in the opportunities being presented by the convergence of entertainment, sports and technology and the resulting ability for CFG to generate long-term growth and new revenue streams globally.\u201d\nCFG, as well as owning City, owns or has stakes in clubs in the US, Australia, Japan, Spain, Uruguay and China.\nCity progressed to the Champions League knockout stage with Tuesday\u2019s 1-1 draw at home to Shakhtar Donetsk, yet Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, City\u2019s scorer, warned the team will have to improve. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do all the things right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe struggled a little bit in some areas and this is the Champions League, it\u2019s a very competitive competition. All the teams play very good football and Shakhtar played quite well.\n\u201cWe also let them play, gave them the space to play. That shows that, if we don\u2019t reach our best level, you are going to struggle in this competition. We need to learn from it.\n\u201cFortunately, the result didn\u2019t mean a negative outcome for us, but we need to be aware that in this competition it will get even more difficult, especially in the knockout stages. It\u2019s important to learn from this kind of game.\u201d\nCity have work to do in the Premier League too, trailing Liverpool by nine points.

        "content": "Today\u2019s fluff is going undercover\nAt time of writing, Unai Emery is still the Arsenal manager, but it\u2019s not looking good. The Spaniard\u2019s office has been relocated to a trestle table in the basement, and Granit Xhaka is using his parking space. Metaphorically speaking, of course. Today\u2019s tabloids reckon anything less than a win at Norwich on Sunday will see Emery permanently relocated at a travel tavern.\nDetails of the shortlist to replace him are sketchy, but the Mail report that the Wolves manager, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, is at its summit. Nuno\u2019s rigid philosophy and surly post-match demeanour would be a refreshing change at the Emirates, but why he would take a sideways move at this stage is up for debate. If the club want a company man instead, they could turn to former players Mikel Arteta or Freddie Ljungberg.\nWhoever replaces Emery, they will surely have a shot at reviving Arsenal\u2019s top-four ambitions with the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette in the squad. Ah, hold on, what\u2019s this? Aubameyang is interesting Real Madrid and Barcelona, and the 30-year-old doesn\u2019t fancy winding down in the Europa League. Quite where he\u2019d fit in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s ageing forward line-up, we\u2019re not sure, although he could find himself coming off the bench for Neymar next season.\nLionel Messi still wants the Brazilian back at Barcelona, and PSG are more concerned about keeping Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, with the French forward currently the subject of a relentless pursuit by Zinedine Zidane. Where would that leave PSG? Well, the Mill is just spitballing here, but Lacazette also wants Champions League football, and he would get a guaranteed eight games per season in Paris.\nYou know sacking season is in full swing when Manchester United\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r isn\u2019t among the top three managers under pressure. Instead, he\u2019s making plans for January. Plan A is an audacious, unlikely-to-actually-happen \u00a3180m double swoop for Erling Braut Haaland and Jadon Sancho. Plan B also focuses on young talent, but is a little more thrifty. Atlanta United playmaker Ezequiel Barco, Valladolid centre-back Mohammed Salisu and Reading forward Danny Loader are the latest names for United fans to furiously Google.\nWe\u2019ve got pretty far into this thing without mentioning Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, but the Spursy One is an inevitable presence in the back pages. Despite Christian Eriksen changing the game against Olympiakos, his chances of staying still look slim. Real Madrid are ready to thrash out an agreement in January, but Juventus are about to enter the fray. Mourinho is prioritising defensive recruits, with Nice right-back Youcef Atal and Schalke keeper Alexander N\u00fcbel on his wish-list. Peterborough forward Ricky-Jade Jones is also interesting Spurs, United and Liverpool.\nThe Mill are as guilty as anyone else of sleeping on Leicester City, not a paid-up member of the \u2018big six\u2019 but the only club that look capable of catching Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers is planning to hit the north in search of January recruits, and wants to bring Celtic centre-back Kristoffer Ajer and explosive Rangers forward Alfredo Morelos over the border to join his title-chasing party.\nIn other news, Milan want shot of striker Krzysztof Piatek, who has scored a not-completely-terrible three goals in 13 games so far this season. United and Chelsea have been linked, but a loan move to a team drifting towards trouble (let\u2019s go with West Ham) seems a better fit. Speaking of which, Zlatan Ibrahimovic might also be available for a dangerously expensive loan move. The striker has bought a 50% share in Swedish side Hammarby, but may still take his playing talents elsewhere.",

        "content": "By striving to make practice perfect, a new academy for social workers is turning around Coventry\u2019s children\u2019s services\nCoventry city council: children\u2019s services social work academy\nBranded as \u201cinadequate\u201d by Ofsted inspectors five years ago, Coventry city council realised it had to do something if it was ever going to achieve its ambition to become \u201cgood\u201d and be the employer of choice for graduate social workers. With a new director of children\u2019s services and a new principal social worker in place in 2016, the authority designed a new social work academy model with advice from local universities.\n\u201cWe took a long hard look at ourselves. We knew that we had some really good social workers and needed to improve the brand and the reputation of children\u2019s services,\u201d says children\u2019s principal social worker, Lee Pardy-McLaughlin. \u201cI felt we needed an academy that supported social workers at the point of qualifying, which would help them to be practice-ready.\n\u201cBut another part of the problem was that there was a shortage of placements for students in their final year, both nationally and regionally. We found that a lot of newly qualified social workers who came to us had never even knocked on a family\u2019s door before.\u201d Now, all newly qualified social workers at Coventry spend their first six months attached to the academy.\nThey are given a limited caseload and are attached to a children\u2019s team, spending one day a week in the field shadowing a more experienced social worker. The remainder of the week is spent at the academy on learning and development. \u201cI say the academy is like a paddling pool \u2013 we work very slowly at building up their confidence,\u201d says Pardy-McLaughlin.\nSixty newly qualified social workers have gone through the academy since it was set up last year. It has two intakes annually \u2013 and the initiative is already bringing results.\nFeedback from social workers illustrates its success. Social worker Bethan McKechnie joined Coventry in January last year on its fast-track to social work programme. She qualified in May and went straight into the academy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s given me a great start,\u201d she says. \u201cComing off a fast-track programme it\u2019s given me the chance to catch my breath and slow down a bit, and think about making that transition from a student into professional social work.\u201d\nMcKechnie says she feels part of Coventry\u2019s progress towards becoming a \u201cgood\u201d authority. \u201cThere is very much a sense that we are part of that journey. You do feel quite evangelical about that \u2013 that what we are doing is best practice and we are going to try and embed that in the team.\u201d\nThe programme has also helped with retention. Between May last year and May 2019 there has been a 50% drop in the council\u2019s use of agency staff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s created a more permanent and stable workforce,\u201d says Pardy-McLaughlin. \u201cBut the culture has also changed to one which is devoted to learning and development.\u201d\nSo what does the principal social worker think sets the Coventry academy apart from others? \u201cI think its unique selling point has to be the learning and support which is available to newly qualified social workers. It\u2019s about working with experienced social workers who know what good practice looks like and supporting our newly qualified social workers to grow and develop.\u201d\nCabinet Office: civil servant talent accelerated development schemes team\nThe Cabinet Office is taking steps to create and secure a future pipeline of diverse leaders across the civil service.\nIts accelerated leadership programmes bring together civil servants from different departments and areas of the UK who have the potential to become tomorrow\u2019s leaders.\nThe programmes are all designed to help deliver the ambitions of A Brilliant Civil Service, a government blueprint to create a service of \u201cconfident leaders who inspire and empower colleagues to be the best they can be\u201d.\nThe one- or two-year schemes target the top 1-3% of \u201chigh-potential\u201d civil servants with leadership qualities. They range from middle managers right through to top director generals who have been identified as future permanent secretaries.\nThe minority ethnic talent association and the disability empowers leadership talent programme provide help in overcoming barriers to climbing the career ladder for those civil servants on the schemes from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, or those who have a disability or long-term health condition.\nMore than 1,000 civil servants have been recruited on to the programmes, run by the civil service talent accelerated development schemes team.\nFeedback from participants illustrates their success. They report increased professional confidence, particularly when dealing with uncertainty, and a better understanding of their own and colleagues\u2019 leadership styles and strengths.\nAn evaluation revealed that graduates from the schemes are promoted more frequently than colleagues on the same grade.\nHousing Executive (Northern Ireland): asset management training programme\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s largest social landlord knew it had to take action when it discovered four years ago that 40% of the workforce responsible for the upkeep of its 86,000 properties were nearing retirement age.\nAs a first step, the asset management division of Northern Ireland\u2019s Housing Executive established a graduate trainee programme. So far 43 graduates have completed the two-year scheme, which includes a postgraduate diploma in construction business and project management.\nIt has launched a school leavers campaign targeting and supporting students aged over 16 who may lack the qualifications needed to follow a career in the sector. It has also offered year-long placements to university undergraduates completing built environment degrees who may have struggled to find an employer to take them on.\nBut the division also realised it had to invest in its current workforce if it wanted to retain them.\nAn agreement with the Chartered Institute of Building \u2013 the professional body for construction management and leadership \u2013 has led to staff in trade and white-collar roles completing its chartered membership programme.\nAnd it has plans to create a construction training centre to support apprenticeships in partnership with its contractors and direct labour organisation.\nThe investment in learning and development has allowed the division to \u201cgrow our own talent in-house from grassroots\u201d. Leeann Vincent, assistant director of asset management, says: \u201cThis is about succession planning for the future and also addressing the skills gap in the construction industry, which is affecting the whole of the UK.\u201d",

        "content": "Mentoring the next generation is a calling for a former Windsor Fellowship beneficiary who\u2019s gone back to where it all began\nKevin Coutinho, gender policy manager, University College London, and chair, Windsor Fellowship\nThere is a pretty simple ethos at the heart of what Kevin Coutinho does. \u201cI want the world to be better by the time I\u2019m dead,\u201d says the 43-year-old. It is this, coupled with his commitment to equality, that drives him to not just do his day job at a university, but also \u2013 unpaid \u2013 run the Windsor Fellowship, a charity helping talented young people from diverse ethnic backgrounds fulfil their potential.\nCoutinho went through the Windsor Fellowship\u2019s prestigious leadership programme for undergraduates himself, sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where he did a three-month placement in 1997. Later, he came back to mentor other young people and, in 2012, when the charity was struggling with the fallout of the recession, he stepped in as chair of the trustees.\nAs private sector funding dried up and government policy shifted away from race equality initiatives, Coutinho used his expertise in management and business to carry out a radical restructure, adapting the programme delivery model and reducing overhead costs. It was his zeal and tenacious leadership, according to Faeeim Nori, the co-trustee who nominated him for this year\u2019s leadership excellence award, that rescued Windsor Fellowship from the brink of closure.\nToday the charity works with schools, colleges and universities, offering innovative personal development and leadership programmes, mentoring, scholarships and paid internships with leading private and public sector organisations. Over the past 18 years Coutinho himself has mentored more than 500 people, from GCSE to post-doctoral students.\nOn top of that, he advises colleagues, writes proposals, coaches staff, is a facilitator on the charity\u2019s programmes and ensures it remains in good financial health.\nThe son of a mechanic and a secretary of Goan heritage, Coutinho was the first of his family to go to university. But aside from one excellent lecturer, he found the experience alienating. \u201cWhen I went I didn\u2019t even know what a 2:1 was,\u201d he says.\nCoutinho says the charity helped to give him exposure to things he wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had. \u201cUniversities give you the formalities of an education, but they don\u2019t necessarily tell you why you\u2019re there or how to make the most of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt helped me understand little things, like being able to make a presentation \u2013 the little things that people from more privileged backgrounds take for granted.\u201d\nIn 2005, Coutinho completed an international MBA at Madrid\u2019s Instituto de Empresa, after being awarded a scholarship. \u201cI realised that to run a charity effectively you needed to understand business,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t only do the feelgood stuff.\u201d\nHe does his paid job in compressed hours to make time for his work with the Windsor Fellowship, and says he gets the best out of staff and volunteers by talking to them and asking questions.\n\u201cThey often say I convince them to do things they wouldn\u2019t want to ordinarily do,\u201d he says.\nCoutinho\u2019s proudest achievement is the fact the Windsor Fellowship still exists. It was born in 1986 as an outcome of the Windsor Conference, held in the aftermath of that decade\u2019s race riots to look at the causes of the unrest and solutions to barriers faced in the employment market by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) undergraduates. Plenty of BAME-led voluntary sector organisations were closing, post-recession, and he did not want it to be another casualty. \u201cIf you go back to the riots, from a community cohesion perspective it\u2019s so important that we keep organisations that focus on race going,\u201d he says.\nBut he thinks people are too often only interested in funding initiatives where groups are seen as being at risk. \u201cSociety is not changing as fast as it needs to. Our institutions don\u2019t reflect Britain,\u201d he says.\nCoutinho collected coins as a child. He always liked the motto on the old 2p piece: \u201cIch dien\u201d (\u201cI serve\u201d). He also likes the \u00a32 coin, with its inscription \u201cstanding on the shoulders of giants\u201d, and shows it to students he is talking to.\n\u201cI always tell them that they are tomorrow\u2019s giants,\u201d he says.\nAlex Johnson, deputy chief fire officer, South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue\nWhen Alex Johnson started out as a firefighter in Derbyshire in 1992, aged 24, less than 1% of the UK\u2019s firefighters were women. \u201cIt was as though I was trying to take men\u2019s jobs,\u201d she remembers. \u201cEvery time I got promoted people would say: \u2018You\u2019re bound to get promoted, because they want women.\u2019\u201d\nThat was one challenge \u2013 but another was the need to break free of feeling she had to conform to a hierarchical, \u201cmilitaristic\u201d leadership style as she rose to senior positions. \u201cI thought: \u2018Actually, sod this, I\u2019m good enough as me and how I treat people is the right way to treat people,\u2019\u201d says the 52-year-old.\nToday, having joined South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue in 2017 as assistant chief fire officer and taken on her current role earlier this year, evolving that culture is a priority. \u201cTo me it\u2019s about bringing people with me, rather than just forcing them to follow \u2026 if you care about people they\u2019ll go that extra mile for you.\u201d\nJohnson has recently set up a women\u2019s mentoring programme across services in Yorkshire and Humber as part of her work on the executive committee of women in the fire service. She mentors dozens of women, both within and outside the fire service, and has re-established South Yorkshire\u2019s equality and inclusion group. \u201cIt\u2019s given us an action plan so people can see what\u2019s changing,\u201d she says. She has also prioritised mental health support for firefighters.\nPenny McKissock, chief executive, Southside Family Project\nWhen Penny McKissock joined the precursor of the Southside Family Project as a coordinator in 1994, she was its second employee. Three years later she took it on herself, and turned it into a thriving charity supporting members of the often hidden deprived communities of Bath as they deal with domestic abuse, mental ill health, substance misuse, homelessness and debt.\nToday it has more than 50 staff \u2013 70% of whom, McKissock estimates, are former service users \u2013 plus a team of more than 30 volunteers who\u2019ve come through the project. It reflects her core belief in the value of lived experience; Southside trains 30 former service users a year as \u201cfamily champion\u201d volunteers who provide peer support, shape services, and often go on to take up paid roles.\nMcKissock survived an abusive childhood herself, at the hands of a stepfather she describes as a monster. \u201cI think that made me very resilient,\u201d she says. \u201cI look back and think that was my training, in a macabre way.\u201d\nShe puts her success, modestly, down to being \u201cincredibly persistent\u201d.

        "content": "At-risk teenagers are being helped with a pioneering new approach to care that\u2019s turning young lives around\nHillingdon council: Hillingdon adolescents team\nNicolas was just 15 when he became caught in a downward spiral that started with smoking cannabis and school exclusions and ended with him being recruited into a county lines gang \u2013 the criminal networks exploiting teenagers to funnel drugs from towns and cities.\nArrested in possession of thousands of pounds worth of crack cocaine in Bournemouth, the future looked bleak for the teenager, who should have been studying for his GCSEs. Instead, the young runaway from Hillingdon in London was on the brink of going into care and looked destined for prison.\nToday, Nicolas (not his real name), now 17, is living at home, attending college, and has a qualification in electrical engineering. He has also been helped to cut ties with the gang \u2013 all thanks to a groundbreaking Hillingdon council project that gives individual budgets to social workers.\nHillingdon adolescents team is behind the scheme, which offers support to young people at high risk of being taken into care. They may be being sexually or criminally exploited, involved in serious youth crime, have gone missing from home or face family breakdown. Help is also extended to their families.\nSet up in November 2018 with \u00a3400,000 funding from the Department for Education\u2019s What Works for Children\u2019s Social Care change programme, the project is supporting 100 at-risk teenagers aged 12 to 17.\nThe full impact of the project is yet to be measured. However, an internal evaluation of its first six months shows 36 young people who would otherwise have gone into care were supported to remain at home.\nThere was also a reduction in missing episodes, an increase in school, college and employment attendance, and reduction in accommodation of young people.\n\u201cBefore we set up the team, we couldn\u2019t get young people to engage,\u201d says Julie Kelly, assistant director of safeguarding at Hillingdon council.\n\u201cNow they engage straight away by choosing their social worker. Social workers see the young people when they need it \u2013 it might be every day for a month or every other day \u2013 rather than the traditional fortnightly appointments.\u201d\nSocial workers are given a real-time insight into young people at risk through Axis \u2013 an intelligent data mapping software that analyses information sharing from police, education, social care, health, youth services and schools and calculates risk. Action is then taken to intervene with the at-risk young person.\nAs well as choosing their own social worker, young people are empowered to collaborate and co-produce their own intervention plans. In February the project took a step forward when frontline staff were given personal budgets for young people to spend without managerial approval. Removing red tape in this way has allowed social workers to think creatively and find solutions quickly to support young people and their families. Activities range from taking a young person out for a meal, to paying for gym membership, therapy, driving lessons or the costs of a laptop.\nFor Nicolas, one-to-one meetings outside the family home with his social worker helped build up a trusting relationship. Slowly they worked together on conflict resolution, managing his diabetes and accessing specialist help to cut ties with the drugs gang. Over six months money was spent on redecorating his bedroom, encouraging Nicolas off the streets. He has also had driving lessons \u2013 something he hopes to put to use in a future job. He is now studying for his next level in electrical engineering.\n\u201cInitially he shouted abuse at me, but that changed and he told me what was troubling him,\u201d says Kudakwashe Kurashwa, Nicolas\u2019s social worker. \u201cHe now has a new friendship group and is getting on well with the family, and studying for his level in electrical engineering \u2013 I have helped change the environment but Nicolas changed himself. In the past it has been hard to get young people to change. But when you see these results, it is really satisfying.\u201d\nAnother person helped by the team is 16-year-old John, who has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, and was expelled from school for smoking cannabis. He began using crack cocaine, heroin and amphetamines after being tricked into taking them. He has been helped to get off the drugs, had regular gym sessions and been supported to do triple science GCSEs as he is interested in a career in medicine.\nKelly is optimistic that social workers will continue with the devolved budgets with savings from care costs being given to the team to carry on with their work.\nNicolas has no doubt how much he has been helped by the team. \u201cI could have been in prison now. But thanks to Kuda, who came into my life when I was going through a very difficult time, I am looking forward to bettering my life.\u201d\nIndependent Living Fund Scotland: transition fund\nDisabled young people with complex needs are being helped to realise their potential and lead independent lives, thanks to a pioneering new service that places them at its heart. Hundreds of 16- to 21-year-olds in Scotland and Northern Ireland have been helped to make the transition to adulthood via an easy-to-use digital system of grants.\nCo-produced by service users, the Independent Living Fund Scotland transition fund for young people provides funding empowering them to improve life choices and play an active role in their communities.\nThe fund is easier to use than traditional services, which often require a formal needs assessment and involve a complicated application process. Applications can be made within 20 minutes and decisions announced the next day. Harvey Tilley, chief operating officer, says: \u201cThe impact for young people has been incredible. Not only have they received funding to purchase items and services that have transformed their lives, they have been given the trust, dignity and respect to determine what is important to them.\u201d\nApplicants include young people on the autism spectrum and those with learning disabilities, mental ill health or physical difficulties. Grants average \u00a32,500 and there is a limit of \u00a37,500 a year.\nOne successful applicant is Katie McClusky, 16, who has Down\u2019s syndrome. She recently applied to the fund to advance her horse skills and gain a formal qualification.\nSince the digital launch of the fund a year ago, more than 1,000 applications have been approved, totalling almost \u00a32.5m in grants.\nMary Stevens Hospice\nA hospice project aimed at improving services for people on the margins of society has broken new ground in palliative care training. Working with Birmingham City University, learning disability organisations, police and hostel workers, staff at the Mary Stevens Hospice in the West Midlands have held workshops on palliative care and raised awareness of support. It is thought to be the first time police in the UK have had palliative care training.\nThe hospice originally focused on the needs of people with learning disabilities and dementia. It invested in specialist sensory equipment to support patients in a safe setting and included picture signs to clinical services. But the death of a homeless man in Dudley in January 2018 prompted staff to expand the project and hold workshops raising awareness of palliative care and bereavement support to police, hostel workers and local authority staff. Police discovered the body of 46-year-old Steven Garratt in a derelict spot, with his dog at his side. It was just seven miles from the hospice, which wants to see palliative and end of life care accessible, inclusive and available to all.\nGemma Allen, hospice diversity and inclusion lead, says: \u201cSteven\u2019s death got us thinking about how we could help people who are homeless. People experiencing homelessness may face obstacles accessing healthcare.\u201d\nWorkshop delegates identified five people in their last year of life and referred them to the hospice following the training.\nThe hospice, which received \u00a320,000 in grants for learning disability and dementia work, plans to share and build on its work.",

        "content": "In a city of 30,000 university students, housing and poverty are higher up the agenda than Brexit\nFor the first time in his life, Musah Stamburi will walk into a polling station next month and exercise his democratic right to vote in a general election. It\u2019s a significant moment for the 22-year-old, who arrived in the UK six years ago from Zimbabwe and is now in the third year of a degree in public relations and communications.\nStamburi is one of more than 30,000 university students in the port city of Southampton, where he lives in the Itchen constituency held by the Conservatives with a majority of just 31 votes. \u201cThis year I\u2019m definitely voting,\u201d says Stamburi, who lives with his mother. \u201cThis time I feel we all have to \u2013 because everything is a mess from Brexit.\u201d\nLike many students, Stamburi is inclined to vote Labour. He doesn\u2019t want Brexit to happen, but he\u2019s more interested in talking about tuition fees, housing and immigration. He\u2019s worried about how he will pay back the \u00a354,000 of debt he will accrue through the course of his degree at Solent University. He is concerned about Conservative immigration policies. \u201cAs immigrants we feel marginalised to a certain extent. It knocks your confidence,\u201d he says. And then there\u2019s housing.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to discover that housing is a huge issue in Southampton. In a Guardian call-out to readers in the city, it came up again and again in the hundred-plus responses. Students such as Stamburi wonder how they will ever afford a home, saddled with decades of student debt. Other young people in the city complain of being priced out of the rental housing market, which is prohibitively expensive and increasingly targeted at students with their student finance and regular loans.\nAccording to a recent report by the Southern Policy Centre thinktank, homelessness among young people in Southampton increased by 35% in a single year between 2016 and 2017. The region has become one of the most unaffordable for housing in the UK, with an average monthly rental for one-bedroom properties of \u00a3646. The authorities have been accused of prioritising housing for young professionals and families rather than single young people on low incomes. The city centre, meanwhile, is dotted with shiny new student housing developments such as Southampton University\u2019s Mayflower Halls, complete with state-of-the-art gym and an annual rent of \u00a36,000-\u00a310,000.\nOn a chilly November morning, homeless people are very much in evidence in Southampton city centre, where bundles of duvets line the high street alongside the Christmas market. Among them, sitting on the freezing pavement, is 30-year-old Emma Eaton who moved to Southampton to look after her sick mother, but when she was no longer needed found herself homeless, sleeping in a donated caravan parked behind a shop in the city centre.\nEaton has no address so she could not register to vote. She says Brexit wouldn\u2019t make any difference to her one way or the other. Her main concern is the roof over her head, or lack of it. \u201cIt\u2019s all for students,\u201d she says. \u201cGranted, we need the students for our economy, but we also need housing for us.\u201d The day we meet, she has already been offered a place in bed and breakfast accommodation but is worried about giving up the caravan in exchange for what will only be a temporary arrangement.\nIt\u2019s a very long way from where she had hoped to be at this stage in her life. At 18 she planned to go to university to study child psychology, but after becoming pregnant as a teenager her life spiralled out of control. She has bipolar schizoaffective disorder \u2013 two of the four children she went on to have are being brought up by their father and two have been adopted. Now she begs for money outside Pret A Manger and has little faith that the general election \u2013 whatever the outcome \u2013 will have any impact on her desperate personal circumstances.\nA little further down the high street, squeezed between Unilife student accommodation and a Coral betting shop, is No Limits, a charity offering advice, support and counselling to young people in Southampton. It\u2019s busy. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming. There is a shower and a washing machine for those who need them; there is help with writing a CV or job application, and specialist services are available for young people needing help with substance misuse and mental and sexual health.\nIts chief executive, Annabel Hodgson, acknowledges Brexit is an important issue for many young people in the city who may want to travel and work overseas, but for the disadvantaged young people who depend on her charity\u2019s services, it is not high on their agenda. \u201cThe major issues would be housing and homelessness,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a university city with two large universities, local young people really struggle to get into independent living. Landlords would rather rent for a year to a group of students than a young person who is on benefits or a zero-hours contract.\u201d\nWith the growth in insecure employment, the city has seen a huge increase in the use of food banks, with churches opening their doors to those in need, and Hodgson says the charity is seeing more and more cases of young people in absolute destitution, unable to jump through the hoops to get the help they need. Youth services have gone, and apart from voluntary sector organisations, Hodgson says there is no one engaging with Southampton\u2019s teenagers until they\u2019re in serious trouble.\nThe city\u2019s schools have suffered the same cuts as the rest of the country, with the loss of learning support assistants penalising the most disadvantaged pupils who depend on them. \u201cEducation is not fit for purpose for some of our young people,\u201d Hodgson says. Exclusion rates are high and pupils are put on part-time timetables of as little as an hour a day. She is encouraged by Labour\u2019s plans for a universal youth service and fears another Conservative government will lead to further privatisation of the NHS. On another note, she adds: \u201cI think Jeremy Corbyn is the least likely of any potential prime minister to lead us into another war.\u201d\nHodgson, a single parent of two adopted children, is also worried about Southampton\u2019s air pollution, an issue that came up repeatedly in our call-out and in interviews in the city. \u201cWe live in a really polluted city,\u201d she says. \u201cSouthampton has got some of the worst air quality. We\u2019ve got the docks and the cruise ships come in and leave their diesel engines running. Lots of my friends have asthma. We absolutely know it\u2019s having an impact.\u201d\nSouthampton is indeed the number one cruise port in northern Europe, welcoming 2 million passengers every year. It is also home to the UK\u2019s second-largest container terminal, catering for the largest container ships in the world. Last Tuesday, the vast bulk of the Queen Mary 2 cruise liner could be seen awaiting passengers for her transatlantic voyage, smoke drifting ceaselessly from her funnel. An ongoing dispute over plans to expand the airport has also helped to put environmental issues high up the agenda in Southampton.\nIn the quiet of the Coffee Pot, a small hall attached to the Church of the Holy Saviour in Bitterne, in the east of the city, a group of older residents have gathered for their twice-weekly coffee morning. They don\u2019t want to give their names, but they too are concerned about the pollution and congestion caused by the container and cruise ships. They are worried about the state of footpaths and the difficulty of getting an appointment with their GP (it can take up to four weeks), and they\u2019re unhappy that their local walk-in medical centre and police station have closed.\nOrdinarily they try to avoid the subject of Brexit, but for the Guardian\u2019s benefit they let rip. Most want to get it done, and will vote accordingly. Just one, a retired shipbuilder, says he wants to stay in the EU and will vote Liberal Democrat, but even those who support Brexit would prefer to talk about anything else. \u201cI want Brexit. I want that done,\u201d says a woman who goes on to talk at length about her problems accessing benefits and mental health services.\nLater Stamburi, who has just finished his night shift as a support worker in a mental health unit, ponders on optimism. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m optimistic, but I will vote with hopes for a better future. My overall attitude to the election would be \u2018hit and hope\u2019.\u201d",

The handing over of libraries to voluntary groups to run them is an abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Corbyn.\nThe latest figures from Cipfa found that volunteers in libraries increased last year by 3,000, to 51,394.\nThe Labour leader, asked if he could promise his pledge to protect libraries would be honoured should Labour win the general election, told Penguin: \u201cI can absolutely give you this guarantee.\u201d\nHe said that libraries gave him \u201ca fantastic start in life and I want that for everybody\u201d.\n\u201cI grew up in a small town in Shropshire. My mum and dad loved books. I became a volunteer librarian at school. I learned the Dewey Decimal system, which I still remember,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also had a branch library across the road and I\u2019d go there after school and look at the great big atlases and it was my way of looking at the world, understanding it.\u201d\nThe Labour party\u2019s manifesto makes more pledges on libraries than the other parties, promising a \u00a31bn cultural capital fund \u201cto transform libraries, museums and galleries across the country\u201d. \u201cWe will ensure libraries are preserved for future generations and updated with wifi and computers. We will reintroduce library standards so that government can assess and guide councils in delivering the best possible service,\u201d it says.\nThe website Public Libraries News said that \u201call of the party manifestos largely treat libraries as an afterthought\u201d, with the Conservatives promising \u00a3250m for libraries and museums.\n\u201cThat sounds nice but this amount is over five years and the amount for libraries will be far less per year than recent cuts overseen by the same party,\u201d writes librarian Ian Anstice. \u201cSo, not much joy there then, but more than with the Liberal Democrats who mention libraries only as a location for the collection of free sanitary products.\u201d",

Of the 13 acts announced so far, only two are women, pop star Rita Ora and rapper Little Simz.\nTRNSMT\u2019s Geoff Ellis told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019d love there to be a higher representation of females but there isn\u2019t, certainly on the acts we\u2019re announcing today.\u201d He added: \u201cWe need to get more females picking up guitars, forming bands, playing in bands.\u201d\nAt the 2019 edition of the festival, only three of the 23 acts on the main stage were women. This year, it introduced the Queen Tut\u2019s stage, which only features female acts. The festival\u2019s head of communications, Aarti Joshi, decried criticism that it was a box-ticking exercise and said that a balanced line-up is a \u201clong-term goal\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving that platform to help more females see that kind of opportunity because you do get more of a drop-off at a grassroots level and there are less female artists around,\u201d said Ellis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about booking more female acts because if there are less of them then there are less of them to go round all the festivals.\u201d\nThis year, the Barcelona festival Primavera staged a 50-50 gender split lineup, which it billed as \u201cthe new normal\u201d. In 2018, 45 festivals signed a PRS Foundation pledge committing to balanced bills by 2022, a number that has since grown to 200.\nGlastonbury\u2019s Emily Eavis said recently that the 2020 edition of the festival will be \u201cas close to 50-50 as we can\u201d.\nShe told Music Week: \u201cIt\u2019s as important to have females on the bill as much as men but the pool \u2013 certainly on the headliner front \u2013 is not as big. So we have to work on that as an industry and nurture all these women coming through.\u201d",

        "content": "A protester recalls conditions inside campus and questions where the movement goes next\nIt took a lot of courage for Peter Lui to go down the sewage drain \u2013 but he thought it was better than surrendering to the police who had besieged Polytechnic University in Hong Kong.\nNow, instead of celebrating his successful escape a few days ago, he has become despondent. After returning home, he burned all his protective gear and swore he would have nothing to do with the anti-government movement that began almost six months ago.\n\u201cI won\u2019t care any more. I am utterly disappointed,\u201d said Lui, who was the last of his group to leave. One was arrested, one escaped and two turned themselves in, he said. Lui is critical of the large numbers of fellow protesters who surrendered to police.\n\u201cWhat kind of \u2018militant\u2019 protesters are they? They surrendered!\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re afraid of autocracy, then don\u2019t come out to fight! Where is their determination? Democracy doesn\u2019t fall from the sky. You have to make sacrifices to fight for it.\u201d\nBy Wednesday, the university stood almost empty. More than 1,100 are said by police to have left the campus after having their identities registered. Dozens are believed to have escaped. The campus was reported to be in a bad condition as rotten food and rubbish gave off a foul smell and abandoned personal belongs and unused molotov cocktails were strewn across the grounds.\nPolice are set to enter the campus on Thursday to collect evidence and remove hazardous substances after university staff searched but failed to find any remaining protesters. District Commander Ho Yun-sing said if police find protesters inside the campus, they will handle it in a \u201chumanitarian way\u201d and offer medical attention before registering their identities. The campus will, however, not immediately re-open to the public and the media.\nBut in a dramatic twist on Wednesday night, a masked protester told local media that about 20 people were still holed up on campus and urged the police not to enter the site because most were terrified of being arrested.\nLui was one of hundreds who had been holed up at Polytechnic University for days after violent clashes broke out between protesters and police on 16 November.\nThe red-brick campus in Kowloon was taken over by demonstrators as they tried to block the neighbouring cross-harbour tunnel as part of a wider plan to paralyse traffic across Hong Kong. After intensive fighting in which police used teargas and rubber bullets and protesters threw molotov cocktails and shot arrows at police, officers locked down the campus, announcing that anyone coming out would be immediately arrested for taking part in a riot.\nHundreds of protesters tried to leave, only to be beaten back by teargas, rubber bullets and water cannon. After dozens were caught, they sought more desperate measures, including crawling through sewage and storm water drains, abseiling down ropes, jumping from bridges and escaping on to train tracks.\nThe complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill\nHong Kong\u2019s leader,\u00a0Carrie Lam, has said her government will formally withdraw the bill that ignited months of protests. Hong Kong residents had feared it could be used by China to extradite people for political reasons. They want guarantees that it cannot be reintroduced at a later date.\nWithdrawal of the use of the word 'riot' in relation to the protests\nProtesters want the government to officially recognise that their movement has been a series of legitimate protests, rather than a riot, as has been stated in official communications.\nUnconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped\nHundreds of people have been arrested in recent weeks, and the protesters are demanding that all of them be freed, and that no convictions should stand against any of them.\nAn independent inquiry into police behaviour\nPolice use of force has escalated since the demonstrations began, while protesters have also resorted to increasingly violent measures. Demonstrators say an inquiry into police brutality is the number-one priority.\nImplementation of genuine universal suffrage\nHong Kong's chief executive is currently selected by a 1,200-member committee, and nearly half of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by limited electorates representing different sectors of the economy. The protesters want to be able to vote for their leaders in free and open democratic elections.\u00a0\nFor those remaining, as the days went by, panic intensified as food ran out and people became emotionally unstable. Lui recalled how some trapped inside began to talk to themselves while others screamed and cried.\nDuring the seven days when Lui, a worker in his mid-20s, was trapped inside the campus, he was on a permanent state of alert as he watched police movement in case they might storm the campus. He was also trying to look for possible escape routes and scrambling to find food as supplies dwindled during the week.\nThe police\u2019s hardline attitude did not help. At the start of the siege, police deployed water cannon and a long range acoustic device. Then they used loudhailers to scold protesters inside the campus. Police called them rioters and ordered them to hold up their hands to surrender. \u201cThey kept swearing and shouting at us,\u201d Lui said. \u201cWhen they saw us scrambling for food they shouted: \u2018dead cockroach!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was impossible for me to hold my hands up to surrender and become their prisoner,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody wanted to come out \u2013 once they register you identity, they would prosecute you.\u201d\nPolice this week softened their tone to say they would not immediately arrest people found on campus but would register their identities and investigate them later. As of Monday, police said more than 1,100 people, including around 300 under the age of 18, had left the campus after being registered.\nLui says he became disappointed in the behaviour of fellow protesters. As the days went by, he saw people hiding food for themselves and refusing to talk to others. \u201cPeople changed \u2013 they became so selfish,\u201d he said. \u201cI too blocked out other people, I don\u2019t trust anyone, I only believe in myself.\u201d\nThe Rev Youngman Chan, who went to the Polytechnic University campus to search for protesters but returned empty handed, said he was heartbroken that young protesters had become so despondent that they refused help.\n\u201cHaving seen what has happened in the past few months, they are terrified of being violently treated. This is a tremendous tragedy,\u201d he said.\nBut Derek Wong, a protester who escaped through a a stormwater drain after being holed up on campus for four days, said he was as determined as ever.\nWong, 27, said Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s refusal to give in to more political demands from protesters, particularly their request for an independent inquiry body to investigate police brutality, meant their fight would only escalate.\nAfter the landslide victory of the pro-democracy camp in the district council elections on Sunday, Lam only promised to set up an independent review committee to look at the causes of the social unrest.\n\u201cRight now the police are using excessive force against us, and we have no way of holding them accountable, so resistance is normal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen resistance meets a bottle neck, it can only escalate.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the movement will turn underground and we\u2019ll see guerrilla attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess we won\u2019t have a peaceful Christmas this year.\u201d\n Names have been changed to protect interviewees\u2019 identities",

        "content": "Balvin was a minor Colombian artist who became the fifth most streamed on the planet without using English, showing how embracing national pride can be a force for cultural good\nIf I had to make a personal playlist for the past decade, J Balvin\u2019s 2012\u2019s early reggaeton track Tranquila would make the cut because of the nostalgia it conjures up around sunshine, good food and dancing with cute Colombian boys. That year, I was living my best life in Bogot\u00e1, and Tranquila blasted out of nightclubs, bodegas and Blackberrys up and down the country. Its rather corny music video was shot in Cartagena, far away from the touristy colonial city, and presented a skinny Balvin covered in tattoos \u2013 but any bad-boy image that he might have had was undercut by his bouncy dance moves, fresh face and cheeky smile.\nAt the time, few could have predicted that Balvin would ensure Colombia claimed its space not just in the world of reggaeton, which has traditionally been dominated by Puerto Rico and Panama, but beyond Latin music, seeping into the bloodstream of music scenes across the globe.\nToday, you don\u2019t need to be anywhere near Colombia to hear Balvin\u2019s music \u2013 he\u2019s the fifth most streamed artist on Spotify internationally, with more than 53 million listeners a month. Ahead of him are Ed Sheeran, Post Malone, Camila Cabello and Khalid, all predominantly Anglophone artists. Puerto Rico\u2019s Daddy Yankee sits at No 10, and although he is perhaps the most recognised face in Latin music, thanks to the enduring popularity of 2004\u2019s Gasolina and the record-breaking success of Despacito in 2017, Balvin has arguably done more to shape the international music landscape of the past decade.\nAs well as being the charismatic go-to for the infectious fun and sensuality that makes Latin music so appealing, an impressive, tactical body of collaborations with international artists has helped maximise his reach in different markets. Safari, his 2016 single with Pharrell Williams cemented his international standing; in 2017 he collaborated with French artist Willy Williams for Mi Gente, generating 2.5bn views on YouTube, and when Beyonc\u00e9 jumped on the remix a few months later she switched to singing in Spanish, a clear indicator of Balvin\u2019s influence.\nHe is almost always the centrepiece of each collaboration he does, singing exclusively in Spanish \u2013 just like other popular Latin acts like Daddy Yankee and Bad Bunny, despite the fact that they all speak fluent English. But Balvin in particular has used the space that he has carved out in the Anglophone market to pull in other artists, including Brazilian pop icon Anitta, with whom he released two tracks \u2013 Downtown in 2017 and Machika in 2018 \u2013 both of which helped launch her international career.\nIn her Netflix series Vai Anitta, which documents her transition from the Brazilian scene into America, Anitta ends the recording session for Machika with Balvin and his producer Sky Rompiendo by humbly thanking them, saying: \u201cIn Brazil, I\u2019m like huge, but here I\u2019m like nobody \u2026 and you guys are doing something for me that nobody else has.\u201d\nIn 2018, J Balvin had his first No 1 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 on Cardi B\u2019s I Like It, alongside Puerto Rican trap star Bad Bunny. In spring 2018, I managed to scam my way into Coachella as a backing dancer (a long story) and my highlights were Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s epic Homecoming and Cardi B\u2019s set, where she twerked with abandon at five months pregnant. Both of these performances featured guest appearances by Balvin; Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s only other guests were Jay-Z and Destiny\u2019s Child.\nBalvin, though, is merely the most successful figure to have leveraged the democratisation of music through streaming platforms and social media, maintained his mother tongue, and brought a unique identity to a young, curious, global audience: this globalisation of indigenous pop is one of the defining stories of the decade.\nElsewhere at Coachella that year there was a noticeable rise in the number of international acts performing, with France being particularly well represented. Afro-trap rapper MHD, French-Moroccan DJ Petit Biscuit, French-Cuban twins Ibeyi and even Jean-Michel Jarre made the lineup. These artists, like Balvin and his fellow Latinos, all perform predominantly in their own language, and yet were received warmly by the rainbow-glittered English speakers at Coachella.\nFrance is an interesting case study, as it has always been very protective of its cultural identity. In 2018, President Emmanuel Macron launched a campaign to make French the first language in Africa \u2013 a plan described by celebrated Congolese writer Alain Mabanckou as a form of linguistic colonisation \u2013 but efforts to protect the French language have bolstered the French music scene, and urban music has been an unlikely beneficiary of this drive.\nGrowing up, we had a pirate satellite box at home, programmed to watch French cable so that my dad could get all of the channels his family were watching in Algeria. This meant having access to French MTV \u2013 very exciting \u2013 but all the American shows were dubbed into French, including Keeping Up With the Kardashians. I later learned that this was down to French laws that enforced quotas for how much television and broadcast music had to be French-language: on radio until 2016, for example, it was 40% of all output.\nRecord labels and DJs had to make sure there were enough French speaking artists to play, so throughout the 1990s and the 00s when the United States dominated the international music scene,young rappers were needed in France to fulfil the quotas, as well as the insatiable appetite of young people in France for hip-hop. This is arguably why France now has the second-biggest hip-hop market in the world after the US.\nAlthough there was a pushback from French radio to reduce the quotas \u2013 now 35% \u2013 the rise of streaming sites and the decline of radio means that the issue of quotas doesn\u2019t really matter. The massive success of rap duo PNL, who were the first French group to have a single in Spotify\u2019s Top 30 global streams, is an example of how French artists no longer rely on traditional radio plays to ensure their records reach an increasingly international audience. These brooding brothers refuse to do interviews with journalists or collaborations with other artists, which gives them an air of mystery in a world saturated with noise from social media and self-promotion; the video for Au DD was the first ever to be shot at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\nFrench electronic duo the Blaze also know that music videos are an essential tool: they have racked up millions of views for their cinematic, poetic videos which address themes of youth, displacement and identity. Shot in Algeria, my country of heritage, the video for 2017 track Territory documents the homecoming of a young Algerian man with sensitivity, beauty and accuracy. There has never been a music video of that quality shot in Algeria before, and it was emotional to see English friends of mine sharing it on social media \u2013 something that I might have thought of as niche and personal was resonating with other people. The Blaze\u2019s Jonathan Alric explained the video: \u201cWe all have a place we call home, and we often live far from it.\u201d This tension is central to any immigrant experience, and is now a central tension in pop music, too.\nBalvin, PNL and the Blaze\u2019s kind of music \u2013 rooted in one place but dispersed across the world \u2013 can help build connections between communities at a time when younger generations are more mixed than ever. More than 18% of Americans (about 40 million) identify as Hispanic or Latino, the nation\u2019s second-largest racial or ethnic group. African Americans and a global black diaspora similarly play a huge part in the global rise of African artists. When Nigerian star Burna Boy won a BET award this year, his mum went viral on Twitter when she said: \u201cEvery black person should please remember that you were Africans before you were anything else.\u201d\nWhile my dad\u2019s generation grappled with satellite dishes and cassette tapes, mine is more smoothly connected, sonically and visually to whichever international community it wants, especially through curated playlists on streaming services. For this essay I totted up how many playlists I follow: around 70, including 10 dedicated to different African music alone. I can time-travel through my playlists to my uni days when D\u2019Banj was representing Afrobeats globally and Wizkid was breaking out, or tap into the most recent music that will be playing at the Afro Nation festival in Ghana at the end of the year.\nI have playlists of K-pop artists \u2013 like Balvin, Korean groups such as BTS have made themselves more palatable to English speakers by tacking on guests such as Nicki Minaj and Halsey, while themselves continuing to sing and rap in their own language. I have European playlists, and ones dedicated to fusions, including Arab X, which features Arab artists collaborating with others across the world. Global X has an even broader remit, \u201cthe sound of a new era\u201d, featuring tracks like Human Lost, a collaboration between Balvin and Japanese rap trio M-Flo that has an anime video.\nArtists such as J Balvin are representative of a multilingual, globally dispersed but interconnected generation, and they use every tool at their disposal to appeal to proximate identities \u2013 look at how Brazilian MC Fioti\u2019s hit Bum Bum Tam Tam had Colombia\u2019s Balvin alongside Future (US), Stefflon Don (UK) and Juan Mag\u00e1n (Spain), to ease its passage into different playlists and cultural identities. When I spoke to Roccio Guerrero, one-time architect of the Latin playlists on Spotify, she said: \u201cThe success of a song at a local level allows it to graduate.\u201d The aim for artists wanting to be the next J Balvin was to move up through genre playlists to reach the most popular Latin playlist on Spotify, Viva Latino \u2013 which has 7.5 million followers and is effectively the biggest Latin music radio station in the world. It would then stand a greater chance of being picked up by local playlists in different countries, such as Hot Hits UK. \u201cAfter that: game over!\u201d, Guerrero said.\nThe secret is to balance these blunt approaches with authenticity, maintaining a strong idea of who and what they represent. Unlike many of today\u2019s would-be immigrants, pop has total freedom of movement, but still needs to remain rooted in its home culture to retain its potency.\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

Medellin in particular has struggled to shake off its association with drugs and cartels and the festival is one of the annual highlights with two weeks of events celebrating Colombian culture. As part of that celebration, Balvin headlined an event at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium (where football teams Atl\u00e9tico Nacional and Independiente Medell\u00edn play home games) in front of 40,000 people, including me. He bounded across the stage in snazzy gold dungarees with the same youthful energy that I remember from Tranquila.\nNow arguably Colombia\u2019s biggest cultural export, he had been around the world but was welcomed home by fans waving Colombian flags, knocking back aguardiente and singing along to every word of the spectacular show. He later posted on Instagram: \u201cSoy profeta en mi tierra \u2026 Los amo Medellin\u201d: I\u2019m a prophet in my land \u2026 I love you Medell\u00edn. As the world increasingly feels less tolerant, J Balvin and artists like him are a model for expressing positive, inclusive national pride, and making it resonate across borders. His music, incidentally, also remains perfect for dancing with cute guys.",

What is the reality behind his answers?\nIt costs \u00a360bn to compensate the \u201cWaspi women\u201d \u2013 how do you pay for it?\nCorbyn: \u201cHad a court case gone the other way the government would now be having to do it. What we\u2019re saying is we will do it. We will do it by paying for it from government reserves and if necessary, because it\u2019s not all going to be paid in one year, we will have to borrow in the long term.\u201d\nReality The pledge to work with the women who have been hit by the rising state pension age was made in the Labour manifesto, but no provision for it appeared in the costings \u201cGrey book\u201d that the party published.\nOn Sunday when the party stated that it would pay up to \u00a358bn in compensation, it said that it was treating the cost as a \u201ccontingency\u201d. It also said that some of the payments may be recouped through taxation. Pensioners do pay income tax, so it would seem likely that some of the compensation money would be returned to the Treasury.\nThe party also said that it planned to make the payments over five years. But that would still mean allocating more than \u00a311bn a year, assuming they were equal payments.\nLabour\u2019s use of the work \u201ccontingency\u201d suggest they may plan to use the government\u2019s official contingencies fund. This is typically used to pay for urgent services ahead of parliament providing to make those services available \u2013 the money is advanced then recovered from the individual departments. The latest accounts show it paid out \u00a34.6bn in 2018/19 and \u00a32.9bn in 2017/18, so the Waspi payment is a lot bigger than the sums it typically handles.\nThe fund does not have its own income or a huge bank balance, and so the money would need to be budgeted for elsewhere.\nIt is worth noting that this could become a problem for any future government. Even though the Waspi women recently lost a court case against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), they have applied to appeal against the judgment. Should they end up with a ruling in their favour money will need to be found to compensate them.\nWhat share of income tax revenues do those earning over \u00a380,000 currently pay?\nCorbyn: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give you the exact figure, but they contribute quite a lot.\u201d\nReality In May last year HMRC\u2019s survey of UK income tax liabilities forecast that in 2018/19 the top 5% of taxpayers \u2013 which at that point were those earning \u00a380,900 and above \u2013 would contribute 48.4% of the total income tax take.\nAndrew Neil asked Corbyn when he toughened up the rules to tackle antisemitism. Corbyn gave a hesitant answer, explaining that he proposed that \u201cegregious cases should be fast-tracked\u201d in the \u201clast few months\u201d, and \u201cin the summer\u201d.\nIn July, the national executive committee (NEC), the governing body of the Labour party that oversees the policy-making process, endorsed a proposal put forward by Corbyn to reform the party\u2019s procedures to allow fast-track expulsions in the most serious cases of antisemitism. These cases would be referred to special panels that include the party general secretary, Jennie Formby, and NEC officers, other than politicians, rather than the usual antisemitism panels.",

        "content": "A step-by-step guide to making a pumpkin pie fit for the Thanksgiving or Christmas table\nIf you\u2019re about to swipe away from the page in annoyance, thinking this recipe might have been useful three weeks ago, remember, pumpkins aren\u2019t just for Halloween, they\u2019re for life. Or, at least, autumn \u2013 and, if you\u2019re American, Thanksgiving in particular, where pumpkin pie is as much part of the celebrations as deep-fried turkey and sweet potatoes with marshmallows (I know, I know), and considerably less likely to get lost in translation.\nPrep 25 min\n Cook 90 min\n Makes 1 x 20cm pie\nFor the pastry (or use 300g ready- made shortcrust pastry)170g plain flour1 pinch salt100g cold butter2 tbsp caster sugar1 egg yolk\nFor the pie filling1 small culinary pumpkin or medium butternut squash (see step 1)1 pinch salt145g maple syrup3 tbsp golden rum \u2013 optional1 tsp cinnamon\u00bd tsp ground ginger\u00bc tsp ground cloves (or 5 cloves, ground)2 large eggs, beaten150ml evaporated milk\nThis pie depends absolutely on using the right pumpkin, so don\u2019t be tempted to use the watery innards of your Halloween jack o\u2019lantern, should you still have them hanging around. Instead, search out a decent cooking variety such as crown prince or red onion squash, which are available at greengrocers, farm shops and markets, or use a butternut squash.\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Cut the pumpkin into halves or quarters, depending on its size, and scoop out the seeds and stringy bits. To roast the seeds at a later date, clean them first, then boil for five minutes, drain and dry. Toss with a little oil, and bake, spread out on a tray, in a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for about 10 minutes.\nArrange the pumpkin skin side up in a roasting tin just big enough to fit it all in one layer, then scatter over two tablespoons of cold water. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the flesh is tender all the way through, then remove and set aside to cool slightly. Turn off the oven unless you\u2019re using ready-made pastry.\nOnce the pumpkin is a comfortable temperature to handle, peel off and discard the skin and scoop the flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Whizz until you have a smooth puree, then transfer to a fine sieve set over a bowl or the sink. Leave to drain while you make the pastry (or for about half an hour if you\u2019re not).\nSift the flour into a bowl, stir in the salt, then grate in the butter. Rub in with your fingertips, until the mix looks like coarse sand, then stir through the sugar. Mix the egg yolk with two tablespoons of iced water, and sprinkle half of this over the dough mixture. Stir until it comes together into a firm but not damp ball \u2013 add a little more of the egg yolk mix, if need be.\nGrease a 20cm tart tin. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 3mm thick, and use to line the tin. Prick all over with a fork, and chill for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, then line the case with greaseproof paper and baking beans or rice.\nBake the pastry case for 15 minutes, then remove the hot paper and beans, and bake for another five to 10 minutes, until the base is pale golden. While the crust is baking, put 250g of the pumpkin puree into a bowl with a pinch of salt, and discard the liquid that has drained from it.\nStir the maple syrup, rum (if using; most dark spirits or liqueurs will work here, incidentally) and spices into the pumpkin puree. Taste for sweetness, adding a little more syrup or spice if you think it necessary, then beat in the eggs. Slowly whisk in the evaporated milk until it\u2019s a thick, creamy consistency \u2013 you may not need it all.\nPour the filling into the blind-baked pastry case, and bake for about 40 minutes, checking on it from half an hour onwards, until the filling is set, but still slightly wobbly in the centre. Leave to cool in the tin for at least an hour before serving, so the filling has time to set.",

        "content": "These stories of a tumultuous era bring to life its intimate passions and accidents as well as its overwhelming scale \nOne of the great fortunes of a writer chronicling Europe\u2019s tumultuous, revolutionary 20th century is the flood of memoirs, diaries and letters that accompanied it.\nIt is as if the massiveness of events \u2013 the Russian Revolution, two world wars, the Holocaust, great and terrible experiments in human suffering and freedom \u2013 created a duty to bear witness. Reading these accounts often feels the best way not just to get the facts, but closer to the human impulses at play, the vicissitudes of chance, the reason and unreason of it all.\nThe best witnesses combine the epochal and the personal, metaphysical and mundane. They speak with immediacy and natural resonance, with life\u2019s downbeats and absurdities, the cold and chaos as well as the grand sense-making narratives. They can even make us laugh. In my new book Crucible, I wanted to tell the story of the years 1917 to 1924 \u2013 more similar to our own times than I would like \u2013 in a similar voice, in the present tense, more like a film or novel than traditional history.\nThere are as many different types of witness as reader: those at the centre and at the margin, Rosa Luxemburg penning letters from a prison cell and Einstein taking down impressions of Palestine, those writing accounts with an eye to posterity (all politicians) and those without the time to think. How we read matters as much as who we read. There are those paid to make sense of the world \u2013 journalists such as Hemingway or novelists such as Nabokov or Zweig \u2013 and those whose testimony moves us through the simple miracle of survival. The trouble is to choose. Here are 10 compelling examples:\n1 The Russian Revolution by Nikolai SukhanovIt\u2019s not hard to understand why John Reed\u2019s Ten Days that Shook the World is the popular eyewitness account of the Bolshevik revolution: Reed and Louise Bryant\u2019s immortalisation in Reds, Lenin\u2019s endorsement, the fact Reed beat others to the scoop. But there are problems. In his scrapbooks in the Harvard archive you find a page where Reed tentatively writes his name in Cyrillic script. Here is a man learning revolution as he goes along, breathless with excitement. (He called Ten Days \u201ca slice of intensified history\u201d). Sukhanov, an insider who wound up dead at the hands of Stalin\u2019s henchmen in 1940, is more balanced. He makes sense of the whole complex rigmarole of 1917, February as well as October, the politics as well as the passion and the personalities.\n2. Bureau of Military History, Ireland \n  While books have traditionally been the format of published witness testimony, oral histories and archival digitisation have changed the landscape. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum site offers survivors\u2019 video interviews. Audio projects document Indian partition and the Windrush experience. For Crucible, I found myself engrossed in digital records of grainy, typed-up statements from participants in Ireland\u2019s bloody and intimate independence struggle, all at www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie.\n3. The Diaries of Harry KesslerKessler has it all. Born into wealth, eternally inquisitive, an insider whose sexuality gave him an outsider\u2019s perspective, Kessler got everywhere and met everyone from Bismarck to Josephine Baker. A diplomat as well as a dandy, he understood politics as well as art and cared for both (earning the moniker the Red Count). And he wrote brilliantly. One example: describing Berlin after the failed 1919 Communist coup as continuing on \u201clike an elephant stabbed by a penknife\u201d.\n4. The Diaries of Wasif JawhariyyehI was introduced to Jawhariyyeh while researching 1913: The World Before the Great War and was immediately captivated. An Arab Christian in late Ottoman Jerusalem who spoke English, French and Turkish and was taught the Qur\u2019an by a local Islamic scholar, he was his city\u2019s Harry Kesssler: a poet and musician open to all, living in a world with ever-diminishing space for such eclectics.\n5. Dateline: Toronto, 1920-1924 by Ernest Hemingway \n  Hemingway\u2019s articles from the 1920s read like a novelist\u2019s prep work, his eye scanning the horizon for that single observation which conveys an infinite backstory. Their veracity is secondary. They zing. He describes a 1922 press conference where new Italian premier Mussolini affects not to notice the crush around him, so engrossed is he in some heavy work of literature. Hemingway notes the actual book he pretends to read: a French-English dictionary, held upside down. This may not be true. But it should be.\n6. The Devil in France by Lion Feuchtwanger \n  A German-Jewish anti-Nazi author, Feuchtwanger was nonetheless interned by the French in Les Milles in 1939. While Vichy made peace with Hitler, Feuchtwanger lived in fear of being given up. (This was the time of Casablanca). Defeat, imprisonment, the need to make choices: this is urgently written political and human drama. Feuchtwanger was lucky. He and his wife made it to the US.\n7. If This Is a Man by Primo Levi\n  It was decades before Levi\u2019s account of life and death in Auschwitz, written in 1946 while working in a Turin paint factory, took on the significance it holds today. A testament told with simplicity and directness: the details of camp life and the visceral sensations accompanying it, the accumulation of horrors, the tenuousness of hope and then, one day: \u201cThe Germans were no longer there. The watchtowers were empty.\u201d\n8. The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n  From the 1920s on, westerners such as Emma Goldman and Victor Serge told their tales of Soviet disappointment, experiences from behind the veil of lies already hardening into what would become the iron curtain (a term first used by the British suffragette and socialist Ethel Snowden in 1920). Solzhenitsyn\u2019s work is in a different, higher register: both meditation on and meticulous account of the camps so integral to the mechanisms of fear and power in Stalin\u2019s USSR: the way skin cracks from the cold, the women faced with the awful dilemmas of survival, the Lithuanians who helped him make a rosary from stale bread. A grand indictment equal to its subject.\n9. The Inner Circle: A View of War at the Top by Joan Bright AstleyJoan Bright \u2013 trained in shorthand and typing, confident, easy to trust, keenly perceptive of others \u2013 was at the diplomatic centre of the second world war. A trusted intermediary between the top brass and Churchill, she was there in Quebec, Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam. High-level war management is never just about the (mostly male) principals: generals, diplomats and politicians with fired-up egos. There are all the things that go into making sure information gets where it should, that some small mishap does not upset the whole and personal tensions do not overwhelm the common cause. Bright\u2019s account of her \u201cmarvellous war\u201d gives character and verve to that reality.\n10. The Unwomanly Face of War by Svetlana AlexievichAlexievich is the meta-witness to the Soviet experience, eyewitness to the eyewitnesses. She turns memories into folk epics and gives human scale to the awful hugeness of the \u201cGreat Patriotic War\u201d. Here are the stories of women often drowned by what the war had become in the 1980s USSR, the stale trumpet-blare of Communist legitimacy. Then she did the same for Chernobyl, the starting point of the Soviet Union\u2019s unravelling, as important to the century\u2019s end as its foundation was to its start. Literature is \u201cnews that stays news\u201d, wrote Ezra Pound. This is what Alexievich has done for her eyewitnesses: imbuing their testimony with the power of literature, thus ensuring it remains relevant for all time.\n Crucible: The Long End of the Great War and the Birth of a New World 1917-24 by Charles Emmerson is published by Bodley Head.

        "content": "Luis Enrique returned to his post as Spain manager and took full responsibility for Robert Moreno\u2019s departure from the national team setup, accusing his predecessor and former assistant of being disloyal.\n\u201cI do not want anyone like that on my staff,\u201d Luis Enrique said. In an extraordinary press conference, the returning manager claimed Moreno had proposed remaining in charge until after Euro 2020 and then working as Luis Enrique\u2019s assistant, and that he had rejected the idea.\n\u201cThe only time I have seen Moreno in all this time was on 12 September when we had a 20-30-minute meeting at my home,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cHe was clear that he wanted to coach at the Euro and then I could come back and he would work as my assistant. It wasn\u2019t a surprise: I could see it coming.\n\u201cI try to put myself in his position, I understand it; I understand that he worked hard to be there, to have that opportunity, and that he is ambitious, but for me it was disloyal, and I would never do that.\n\u201cI do not want anyone with that personality on my staff. Ambition is a virtue but over-ambition is not: it is a great defect. That is why I took the decision I took. I told him that day that I didn\u2019t ever see him as a No 2 on my staff. I told him I felt like going back to work, but not yet. The only person responsible for the fact that Robert Moreno is not here, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s not the [Spanish football federation] president [Luis] Rubiales or [its sporting director Jos\u00e9] Molina, nor the federation.\u201d\nMoreno had taken temporary charge after Luis Enrique suddenly left the Spain team camp in March following news that his daughter Xana was seriously ill. Although he continued to manage the team from a distance with Moreno taking his place on the bench, in June Luis Enrique announced that he was stepping down. Moreno was handed the job and given a contract until the end of Euro 2020, although Rubiales said that was always on the understanding that Luis Enrique could return. His daughter died on 29 August.\nIn September, just before that meeting, Moreno had said he would be delighted to step aside if Luis Enrique wanted to return, but it is clear his attitude changed. The following month Luis Enrique told the federation during a meeting in Zaragoza that he was ready to come back. \u201cI never phoned them,\u201d he insisted. He also admitted he had one other call about returning to work, which he turned down \u2013 from a foreign club.\nWhen Moreno became aware of discussions about bringing Luis Enrique back, he demanded that his future be clarified, precipitating his sacking. He left following Spain\u2019s final qualification game last Monday, departing the Wanda Metropolitano stadium in tears. The following day it was announced that Luis Enrique would return.\nAt his presentation on Wednesday Luis Enrique, who was calm and measured even though he did not hold back, said he did not feel proud of the way it had played out, Moreno departing hurt and angry rather than allowing for a smooth return for his former friend.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing anyone suffer,\u201d Luis Enrique said, but he insisted that he had \u201cno regrets\u201d. He added: \u201cI feel partly responsible for that. I am not going to hand out lessons on values to anyone but those are very important in the job we have as we are role models for children.\n\u201cLife situations show you who people are, allow you to really know them. They show you who you can trust and who you can\u2019t, who has ethics, who doesn\u2019t. I see who is on my side and take measures, no more.\u201d\nAsked whether his doubts over Moreno were more professional or personal, he replied: \u201cI have no criticism professionally: he is a capable coach. I had no doubts on the other thing until the words were one thing and the facts very different. But, please, let\u2019s not go rooting through the rubbish.\n\u201cThe controversy is created by someone who worked in my staff for a long time, many years. I am not the good guy in this, but I am definitely not the bad guy either.\u201d",

That compared with 13% offered to the rest of staff.\nThe proposals would mean the banks\u2019s contribution to the chief executive\u2019s pension being cut further, to 15% of salary from July 2020. Retirement benefits for the group\u2019s 65,000 workforce would be raised to the same level, costing roughly \u00a320m a year.\nThe changes, if approved, mean Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s \u00a3419,000 pension package would be cut by more than half to about \u00a3190,000. It is understood that the bank is not planning to raise other parts of his pay package to offset the loss.\nIt signals a U-turn by Lloyds, which has previously defended his pay package despite mounting criticism from politicians, shareholders and City lobby groups, who have been agitating for pension payments to be brought in line with the rest of staff.\nIn June, executives were summoned to appear before the work and pensions committee by MPs, who accused the bank\u2019s bosses of \u201cboundless greed\u201d. Horta-Os\u00f3rio defended his pay package by saying it was lower than offered to rivals at banks such as HSBC, while the bank\u2019s remuneration committee chair claimed staff saw the boss as a \u201cwinner\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201cresent the money\u201d pocketed by the chief executive.\nHorta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s total pay package last year, including bonuses and other incentives, was worth more than \u00a36m.\nLloyds earlier this year cut his pension payments from 46% to 33% of salary. It also capped a portion of his pension, which is linked to his final salary, upon his request, although that move only cost Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u00a33,000.\nThe Investment Association has been urging companies to bring executive pension pay below 25% of salary but has ramped up the pressure by setting a two-year deadline for companies to comply with the UK corporate governance code and bring executive pensions in line with the rest of the workforce.\nThe bank\u2019s chief operating officer and chief financial officer are also given cash worth 25% of their salaries in pension payments. It is expected that their pay packets will also be cut if the proposals are approved.\nCommenting on the news, which was first reported by the Financial Times, a Lloyds spokesman said: \u201cIn line with the regular three-year review of the group\u2019s remuneration policy, we are consulting shareholders on all elements of the policy, including pension allowances.\n\u201cAs stated before, the group will continue to support the guidelines set out by the Investment Association and, once approved by the board, the proposed new remuneration policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2020 AGM.\u201d\nThe proposals follow similar moves by Standard Chartered, which bowed to investor pressure earlier this month with plans to halve the \u00a3474,000 pension payout for its chief executive, Bill Winters, from January.\nThe changes proposed by Lloyds were welcomed by the trade unions representing staff. Rob MacGregor, a national officer for Unite, said: \u201cUnite is clear that the changes announced today represent a progressive step in the right direction by Lloyds Banking Group and the union can only hope that it is the first of many such measures the employer will take when it comes to supporting employees and their pensions.\n\u201cThe issue of income in retirement is for many, particularly younger members of staff, a remote and distant one but it\u2019s an issue that needs to be tackled head-on.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 10 December 2019 to clarify that the Investment Association was urging executive pensions, not salaries, to be be brought in line with the rest of staff",

She is also proposing an NHS Protection Act that would include a double lock for devolved assemblies to consent to any post-Brexit trade deal.\nAttacking Labour\u2019s proposed windfall tax on the North Sea oil and gas industry as the latest example of Westminster \u201cpocketing\u201d Scotland\u2019s oil revenue, she contrasted this with \u00a3200bn to renew the \u201cimmoral\u201d Trident, saying: \u201cA key SNP demand for our support will be the removal of Trident from Scotland and saving of billions of pounds to be invested instead in our precious public services.\u201d\nEmphasising that Brexit \u201cis nowhere near being done\u201d, in a reversal of Boris Johnson\u2019s catchphrase, she said: \u201cScotland will pay a heavy price for the Tories\u2019 Brexit obsession and Labour\u2019s neutrality.\u201d\nDescribing an SNP victory in Scottish seats as \u201ca clear instruction\u201d that voters want a second independence referendum in 2020, she said: \u201cPeople are becoming increasingly sick of hearing Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn talking about not allowing Scottish people to choose their own future.\u201d To cheers and applause, she added: \u201cWell I\u2019ve got news for them: it\u2019s not up to you.\n\u201cMy message to any party seeking SNP support after the election is: if you cannot support this most fundamental of democratic principles then the SNP cannot and will not support you.\u201d\nTaking questions from the media after her speech, Sturgeon was challenged on whether she would continue to support Corbyn in a minority government given the renewed heavy criticism of his handling of antisemitism.\nPaul Edlin, the president of the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council, told the Scottish Daily Mail on Wednesday that Sturgeon would be doing \u201ca deal with the devil\u201d if she were to help Corbyn into Downing Street.\nShe responded: \u201cI deplore Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s lack of leadership on antisemitism,\u201d adding that the SNP would exercise its influence \u201cresponsibly\u201d in any post-election negotiations. \u201cWe would not be signing any blank cheque to Jeremy Corbyn or to any leader,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn addition to all of the other things, we would be very clear in our expectations to any party leader who wanted the support of the SNP to make clear its zero tolerance of antisemitism, Islamophobia, to any form of prejudice or racism. And to those worried about Jeremy Corbyn, it should give a degree of reassurance that SNP MPs are able to apply that pressure.\u201d\nAsked whether she believed Corbyn was personally antisemitic, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know Jeremy Corbyn personally well enough to answer that question, but I do say unequivocally and emphatically that he has failed to get to grips with this problem within his party.\u201d\nShe said Boris Johnson had \u201ca charge sheet of his own to answer\u201d on racism.\nSturgeon refused to say whether she would support moves to replace Corbyn as Labour leader in order to facilitate a post-election deal. \u201cI don\u2019t choose the leader of the Labour party, I wouldn\u2019t choose Jeremy Corbyn, but I\u2019m not in charge of that decision.\u201d",

I am a huge fan of yours.\u201d He gave me the most camel-like stare and walked on as if I didn\u2019t exist.\nThen, in 2007, I found myself working with him on The Cherry Orchard in Sheffield.

He was extraordinarily funny \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t help it \u2013 and he was always suggesting books to read. He seemed to be hugely sensitive about having given up a proper medical career for footling about on the stage. Yet what he did in his footling was staggering.\nThere\u2019s a scene when Ranevskaya hears that the property has been sold to Lopakhin. Jonathan said he had observed people who are ill and coming towards the end of their lives: when they are lying in bed, their fingers restlessly pleat the sheets. He said I should take a piece of my skirt and quietly fold it and unfold it. That\u2019s all I did when she hears the news.\nHe couldn\u2019t stand actors crying on stage: \u201cI will not have that!\u201d So in an earlier scene when Ranevskaya is convulsed with tears, he told me not to to cry but to walk upstage. \u201cTake as long as you like. If the audience get restless that\u2019s fine. Keep them waiting. Do nothing.\u201d One of the critics said \u201cJoanna Lumley can\u2019t even cry\u201d but the doctor forbade me! He was a genius, I adored him and we\u2019d have done anything for him.\nHe loved the challenge of opera, of how multifaceted it was. He was a remarkable director who was able to reach out to audiences of all ages with productions that still feel contemporary. So many of ENO\u2019s greatest productions are his. His Rosenkavalier, Rigoletto and of course the Mikado, which is still going strong, 33 years later. I also worked with him on two new commissions, L\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore and La Boh\u00e8me and it was a real privilege.\nHe could be very tough and critical of others \u2013 he didn\u2019t spare me sometimes, but he was always very funny and there was always a glint in his eye. I remember him saying of one colleague: \u201cI wish he would pull his socks up, if only he knew where his socks were,\u201d or of another: \u201cHe let failure go to his head.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the kind of director who would pore over the score or obsess about the lighting or the conductor. For him, it was all about character.\nHis rehearsals were always very relaxed. Sometimes he let them run without him saying a word, other times he\u2019d be sitting quietly and then jump off his seat to talk to a singer about their individual characterisation. There was always a lot of banter \u2013 he loved the discussion and wanted it to be an equal partnership with his singers. For ENO he is a giant, and his legacy will continue.\nI was Yum-Yum in Jonathan\u2019s original 1986 Mikado production when Eric Idle was Ko-Ko. It was like being in a comedy masterclass with the two of them. The rest of us would just be howling with laughter all day \u2013 their capacity for mutual silliness was off the scale. The now legendary production remains a highlight of my career \u2013 I will never forget it.\nI also worked with Miller on a Don Giovanni, playing Zerlina when I was still in my 20s. He wanted to base the look of his production on some Goya paintings he knew, with one particular statue he\u2019d seen in a museum in Istanbul a crucial part of the graveyard scene. This was before you could just Google these things and I didn\u2019t know they looked like. I had to screw up my courage and say to him, in my direct Yorkshire way, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t travelled like you have and I don\u2019t know what these things look like.\u201d He didn\u2019t patronise me at all but simply brought in some books the next day to show me the works. Later, for a revival of the same production, I was pregnant and was anxious about telling him. But he was delighted. \u201cWell darling, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes complete sense of Zerlina marrying that idiot Masseto. I\u2019m going to insist that all my Zerlinas are pregnant from now on!\u201d\nHe was life-enhancing. For over 50 years he has been a great joy to the nation. I was in his first ever opera production in 1974, Alexander Goehr\u2019s Arden Must Die. Since then we\u2019ve worked together many times. There was a fabulous Marriage of Figaro in 1978 at the Coliseum, the much-loved Rosenkavalier, his radical and vivid retelling of Rigoletto, and I\u2019m currently singing the role of the Mikado in the opera\u2019s 15th revival at English National Opera.\nOne was in awe of his mind \u2013 I remember in the Figaro that he set in 1789 he knew every detail of the period, from the politics to how they wore their hair to what vegetables they ate. Rehearsals were always a delight, and full of laughter, but he was very demanding, insistent that everything had to be convincing in a natural way.\nAnything that felt contrived or exaggerated was total anathema. He might not have been a musician in the academic sense but he was incredibly sensitive to music, and understood its mystery and mysticism and its great emotional power. He always said, \u201cI should be a doctor. I shouldn\u2019t be doing all this theatrical nonsense.\u201d He was simply a great human being and a huge loss to us all.\nI met Jonathan at the Old Vic in 1974 when it was the home of the National Theatre. I was a teenager and quite green. I\u2019d done panto and a stint on Emmerdale Farm. So going into Beaumarchais\u2019s play The Marriage of Figaro, directed by Jonathan Miller, I felt completely unqualified. I had a massive crush on him. He was the first man I\u2019d worked with who had what I thought was a massive intellect and I found it thrilling. But he also had this ferocious sense of humour. It became this cocktail in my head of the perfect man.\nSometimes when I couldn\u2019t quite achieve what I wanted to in the play he would come and do it for me. I know a lot of people who would think that\u2019s the worst thing to do for an actor. But I absolutely loved it. He had this amazing voice \u2013 deep and velvety, very calming. What a life, crammed with so much: you get the impression that not a minute was wasted.\nJonathan Miller directed me as Hamlet and it was a dream. The brain, the wit, the stories: he was fantastic. I auditioned at his house in Camden, which was stuffed with books and these wonderful metal sculptures he had made. I was terrified when he opened the door. I\u2019d had no time to prepare. He just said: \u201cShall we have a quick read and see what happens?\u201d\nJonathan had this unbelievable knowledge but you never once felt uncomfortable or embarrassed to be a mere mortal in his presence. He was so supportive \u2013 and so freeing. In Hamlet, he wasn\u2019t tied to anything apart from the gravedigger scene which he didn\u2019t want to be in any way sombre or melancholy. He wanted me to get my fingers into the eye sockets and really get dirty, examining what it is to not be.\nHe was staying in an apartment above our theatre, Bristol\u2019s Tobacco Factory. We\u2019d sit there and talk about grief, psychology, all kinds of things. I recorded all our conversations. Even just to have met him I would feel blessed but working with him was amazing. Seeing Jonathan\u2019s face light up when his wife, Rachel, came into a room was a wonderful thing. After so many years together they were still so in love.\nSusie Trayling, who plays Ginny in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, has happy memories of working with Jonathan too. We\u2019re dedicating today\u2019s performances to him.\nI was at the beginning of my career in the chorus of Kent opera in 1979 when I first encountered him directing La Traviata. Since then we\u2019ve worked together in many productions in many places and it was always an exciting, stimulating and above all entertaining experience.\nHe knew how to loosen people\u2019s imaginations. He always said that rehearsing an opera is like being a child in a playground \u2013 you can let your imagination fly, and be playful and creative. Even when the scene we were doing was profound or serious there would be lots of laughter in the rehearsal room. I\u2019m currently in his Mikado at English National Opera, a production that\u2019s 33 years old but that still feels fresh and inspired and is bringing in new audiences to opera every sold out night.",

Knox was left with 13 injuries, including a fractured skull, while Charlton suffered a punctured lung.\nMohamud was confronted by officers and tram staff after they heard Charlton screaming. He was Tasered by Sgt Lee Valentine but the probes of the 50,000-volt stun gun became tangled in his thick puffer coat and failed to paralyse him.\nMohamud began charging at police on the platform before stabbing Valentine in the shoulder. A second kitchen knife was found concealed in his coat as he was led to a police van.\nMohamud pleaded guilty on Tuesday to three counts of attempted murder and to possessing a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing for an act of terrorism.\nDr Philip Joseph, a consultant forensic psychiatrist who assessed Mohamud, told the court the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which made him more likely to be violent.\nBecause of his mental condition, Mohamud was said to have believed that the government was targeting him. Rebecca Trowler QC, defending, said that the defendant\u2019s illness made him more \u201cvulnerable to the ideology\u201d.\nShe also argued that his illness was \u201cpivotal\u201d in influencing his interest in jihad, and the idea that the two were not linked was \u201cjust not plausible\u201d.\nAlison Morgan QC, prosecuting, argued that Mohamud\u2019s mental health condition had only \u201cdisinhibited\u201d him to commit the attack he had planned because of his ideology.\nDetectives from Greater Manchester police believe Mohamud, a Dutch national, began planning for the attack towards the end of 2017, when he visited family in Somalia.\nIn video footage from police officers\u2019 body-worn cameras, he can be heard repeatedly saying \u201cthis is for Allah\u201d and \u201cthese attacks will never stop\u201d.\nHe also told one officer: \u201cKeep bombing Muslim countries, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nMohamud, whose parents are Somali, moved to the UK from the Netherlands aged nine. He studied mechanical engineering at the University of Leeds where he achieved a first.\nSince 2015 he had had several inpatient stays in hospitals in both the UK and Somalia as a result of his mental health issues.\nAt the time of the attack, he was not subject to a care plan by mental health services, and had no criminal record.\nAlthough he was detained under the Mental Health Act the day after the attack, he was later found fit to stand trial.",

        "content": "With temperatures plunging, night shelters scramble to deal with fallout after court ruled to allow \u2018lock-change evictions\u2019\nAsylum seekers in Glasgow are facing the prospect of sleeping on the streets in freezing conditions when the wave of \u201clock-change evictions\u201d \u2013 held off for nearly 18 months by public protests and legal challenges \u2013 finally begins in earnest over the next fortnight, with the only available night shelter already full to capacity and frontline workers desperately scrambling to secure more emergency accommodation.\nEarlier this month, Scotland\u2019s highest court upheld a ruling that Serco, which claims it has been \u201cdemonised\u201d over its controversial policy of changing the locks on the homes of refused asylum seekers, did not contravene Scottish housing law or human rights legislation. The private housing provider now plans to evict 20 people a week.\nAnnika Joy, who manages the Glasgow night shelter for destitute asylum seekers, is blunt about the prospects of avoiding a homelessness crisis across the city, where temperatures plummeted to below zero last week. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any slack,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have 24 beds here, booked to capacity every night. We believe there are already 150 asylum seekers at any time who are making survival decisions, perhaps being forced to sell sex or labour for accommodation, or sofa surfing. Now we estimate that another 150 people will be evicted by Serco over the winter.\u201d\nJoy is painfully aware of how basic the shelter\u2019s provisions are. There are no showers in the building, nor sufficient secure space where guests can store possessions. Without enough power for a catering cooker, the hot breakfasts and dinners provided with donated food are made on a minimal four-ring hob. In the bunk room itself, colourful blankets and sheets are draped around beds. It looks like a children\u2019s sleepover party, but these are adult males desperately trying to create privacy among strangers, many of whom suffer from insomnia or night terrors.\nRefused asylum seekers in the UK find themselves in an almost uniquely unsupported position, with no right to homeless assistance or to work to provide for themselves.\nGraham O\u2019Neill of the Scottish Refugee Council says many of those initially refused have their claims accepted on appeal \u2013 55% according to most recent figures. A quarter of those Serco planned to evict when it first announced its lock-change policy in July 2018 have since returned to Section Four homelessness support.\nFor O\u2019Neill, there is a deep frustration that many of those still facing eviction are waiting weeks for decisions that should be made within days, or have fresh asylum claims ready but aren\u2019t allowed to lodge them because of Home Office bureaucracy. \u201cThey are facing street homelessness, when actually in law they have an entitlement to support.\u201d\nJoy says that a longer-term solution is needed across the city: \u201cThese are not people who will need a bed for a few nights until they have their lives sorted out, and we won\u2019t end homelessness in Glasgow without a proper plan for asylum seekers.\u201d\nThe city is already facing a winter crisis, with demands for the council night shelter to open early because of freezing temperatures, while last month Shelter Scotland launched a judicial review that claims Glasgow city council has illegally denied temporary accommodation to homeless applicants.\nWith this in mind, campaigners are working together with local housing associations and charities who have spare rooms, and in discussion with Glasgow\u2019s city council and the Scottish government \u2013 who are limited because they are not legally allowed to directly fund accommodation for over-stayers - to put together a critical mass of long-term accommodation.\nThe plan is to offer accommodation along with wraparound legal and health support, which can also serve the women who make up one in five of those facing eviction and who currently have nowhere to go.\nRobina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, which has been supporting a number of those anticipating eviction, emphasises the long-term psychological toll of the lock-change policy, saying: \u201cPeople are very frightened about the prospect of being turfed onto the street at any time.\u201d\nJoy emphasises how much living circumstances impact on people\u2019s capacity to access support. \u201cIt\u2019s striking how many rights our guests who have been refused by the Home Office have. When people are less anxious about where they are going to spend the night, when they have the encouragement to open up about their experiences, we often discover new information that can help their claims.\u201d",

Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Massimiliano Allegri are also thought to be of interest but Emery said he has his employer\u2019s full support. \u201cReally, the club is supporting me. I feel the club, everyone responsible in that area, is backing me. Really I appreciate it a lot. I feel strong with that support and know my responsibility to come back and change that situation.\u201d\nOtherwise he gave short shrift to questions about his position. \u201cMy future is today and tomorrow,\u201d he said. Asked whether he believes Arsenal\u2019s players had faith in his tactics, he responded: \u201cYes, of course, they\u2019ve shown that.\u201d\nNuno, whose status as a possible contender has aroused particular curiosity in the last 24 hours, flat-batted questions about the link when the Wolves head coach was asked on Wednesday night, as he prepared for his side\u2019s tie against Braga, but he stopped short of saying he held no interest in the Arsenal job. \u201cI think you know me well enough. You know I\u2019m not going to answer about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll never mention an issue that\u2019s not a reality. Mainly because the job has a manager in it. It would be disrespectful. I don\u2019t talk about ifs and possibilities and things that aren\u2019t real.\u201d\nEmery looked weary when facing the media on Wednesday afternoon but emphasised that he was still enjoying the task of improving Arsenal\u2019s fortunes because \u201cI love that work\u201d. He claimed this was not a unique situation in his career and that he had faced moments of strife before, even if this seems a particularly bleak spell for a coach who generally enjoyed an upwards trajectory in Spain and France.\n\u201cIn my career of 15 years I had some situations like today,\u201d he said. \u201cIn every club: in Almer\u00eda, in Valencia, in Sevilla. Every coach will have some moments \u2026 and in 15 years I have had success a lot of times but also bad moments. Really, my career is usually going up but, when I can, I separate moments like that.\u201d\nA sharp improvement in Arsenal\u2019s home form would do wonders for Emery\u2019s chances of battling back from the brink. They have drawn three consecutive games at the Emirates and, in their most recent two, have been comprehensively out-shot by Wolves and Southampton. Emery said stopping opponents creating chances was \u201cthe first tactical issue I want to change\u201d and admitted visiting side\u2019s no longer seem to have a fear factor.\n\u201cOur confidence depends on how we can feel in our stadium with our supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cTeams are coming here and playing fearless against us. That is the first thing we need to change. I know we need to show our supporters our capacity and our skills. I know we\u2019re not really showing that skill and performance 100% with the players, but tomorrow we have a very good opportunity and we are going to try to change that.\u201d\nEmery repeated his now-familiar wish that Arsenal form a \u201cconnection\u201d with their fans. That might be put to the test if the recently deposed captain, Granit Xhaka, returns to the team against Eintracht after missing five games through his high-profile fallout with a section of the support.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the group and has the possibility to play tomorrow,\u201d Emery said. \u201cI hope every supporter supports the team. Xhaka\u2019s comeback is going to be important to us.\u201d It suggested strongly that Xhaka will be involved and he may be joined by other senior players as Arsenal, who would guarantee qualification to the last 32 with a point, fight to stop the rot.\nArsenal (4-2-3-1, probable): Mart\u00ednez; Chambers, Mustafi, Sokratis, Tierney; Torreira, Xhaka; P\u00e9p\u00e9, Willock, Saka; Martinelli.",

        "content": "Her shocking pictures told the truth about mafia murders \u2013 and earned her death threats. Ahead of a powerful film about her extraordinary life, we meet the woman who dared to confront killers. Warning: contains graphic imagery\nLetizia Battaglia can still remember the first corpse she photographed: a man lying beneath an olive tree in a field in rural Sicily. It remains a viscerally unsettling image, made all the more so by its telling details: the dead man\u2019s shoeless left foot, the resigned gaze of the policeman guarding the body, the olive leaves hanging low over the spreadeagled torso. The fact that he was a mafioso murdered in a local feud is, insists Battaglia, neither here nor there. \u201cEveryone,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cis equal in death.\u201d\nWhat has stayed with her, over 40 years later, is the smell that hung in the summer air that day and was carried on the breeze. \u201cIt was very hot and he had been dead for a few days,\u201d she says, drawing deeply on a cigarette. \u201cNow, as soon as you ask about this photograph, it comes back to me. I can almost feel it, this atmosphere of death.\u201d\nWe are sitting at a table in Battaglia\u2019s modest flat in central Palermo, her home town, talking about Sicily\u2019s bloody past \u2013 what the Italians call \u201cthe years of lead\u201d. Now 84, her hair dyed pink as if in defiance of old age, Battaglia is an icon in her native city, the woman who captured the atmosphere of death like no other photographer throughout the dark days of the 1970s and 1980s.\nStill passionately engaged in the social and political life of the city, she speaks about what she once called her \u201carchive of blood\u201d with a mixture of stoicism, anger and regret. \u201cPhotography changes nothing,\u201d she says at one point. \u201cViolence continues, poverty continues, children are still being killed in stupid wars.\u201d\nYet Battaglia\u2019s photographs were evidence that held the mafia to account: two of her images were crucial in proving former prime minister Giulio Andreotti\u2019s links to organised crime, as they showed him with an important mafioso, Nino Salvo, whom he had denied knowing. Later, she will take me to see her latest venture, the grandly titled International Centre of Photography, a gallery and creative hub on a former industrial site on the edge of the city.\nIn one room, assistants are hanging a selection of her early work, originally published in Palermo\u2019s left-wing newspaper, L\u2019Ora. One striking photograph shows several mafiosa sitting in a row in a courtroom. The youngest is staring arrogantly at her camera, his finger pointed towards his mouth. \u201cHe is saying to me, \u2018I will blow your brains out,\u2019\u201d says Battaglia, who lived with regular death threats for two decades.\n\u201cLetizia\u2019s pictures confronted the mafia,\u201d says Kim Longinotto, director of an extraordinary new film about Battaglia. \u201cShe faced up to the fear they instilled. She refused to be afraid at a time when it could have cost her her life.\u201d Using Battaglia\u2019s images alongside news footage and scenes from classic black and white Italian realist films, Shooting the Mafia is, among other things, a sustained riposte to romanticised Hollywood portrayals of the mafia.\n\u201cThey called themselves men of honour,\u201d says Longinotto. \u201cBut, as her photographs show, there was nothing honourable in what they did. Many of those they killed were young activists, trade unionists, truly honourable people challenging corrupt politicians.\u201d\nIn one revealing sequence from the 1980s, Battaglia and her friends stage an impromptu exhibition of her photographs in the village of Corleone, a mafia stronghold that has produced several bosses. The locals initially stare at them out of curiosity then wander away in silence. \u201cIt was an act of incredible bravery and defiance.\u201d says Longinotto. \u201cLetizia was forcing them to look directly at what the mafia were doing, but the people were afraid even to be seen looking at the photographs. That is how deep the fear ran.\u201d\nBattaglia\u2019s rebellious spirit found its true expression in photography. Raised in postwar Palermo, save for a few years when her family relocated to Trieste, she reacted against her strict upbringing by running away to marry a rich older man when she was just 16. Against the odds, the marriage lasted over 20 years and produced three children, whom she took with her when she finally returned to Sicily.\nHer ambition was to be a writer, but her fledgling journalistic career came to an abrupt end when she first picked up a camera at the age of 40. \u201cI thought, \u2018With this in my hand, I can take on the world,\u2019\u201d she says, her eyes lighting up. \u201cSuddenly, I no longer needed kisses or caresses. Instead, I had this confidence, this independence. But it was not just about expressing myself. With the camera, I could also express the inquietude of the world.\u201d\nWhen I suggest that she is, at heart, a romantic, she bridles and fixes me with a fierce stare. \u201cNo! Photography is not a romantic thing for me. It is not so banal. To create a truly great photograph, you have to work hard and be free. A good photographer needs to be inside the photograph somehow so that the viewer can feel their presence.\u201d\nEntirely self-taught, she did not realise how powerful her photographs were until years after she took them. \u201cNo one told me they were good, but I could feel something. The men photographers kept me apart, they did not invite me to their gatherings and I did not care. It was only in retrospect that I realised I was a storyteller who used images instead of words.\u201d\nThe story she told remains one of the most compellingly powerful in photography\u2019s history. But alongside the horror, there is a strange kind of formal beauty that rests in her intuitive grasp of composition and use of shadow and light. \u201cWhen you are shooting the dead, using black and white is a way to be delicate, respectful. It creates its own silence and silence was very important for me.\u201d\nA bleak photograph from 1982 is a case in point: three bodies lie slumped over chairs in a nondescript room, a sex worker and two of her clients, all killed for using heroin that was not supplied by the mafia. \u201cIt was such a small room,\u201d she says, \u201cand when I arrived it was full of people: policemen, doctors, magistrates. I had to wait there until, one by one, they left and I was alone with the bodies. It took an eternity, but I had to be alone out of respect for the dead.\u201d\nThere are silence and beauty too in her heartbreaking portrait of Rosario Schifani, which was taken at the funeral of her husband, a bodyguard killed in a car bomb that targeted Battaglia\u2019s friend Giovanni Falcone, a fearless anti-Mafia judge. His death, and that of his associate Paolo Borsellino the same year, caused Battaglia to retreat from the world for a time.\n\u201cI was in despair,\u201d she says, looking pained. \u201cThere were too many dead people. Falcone and Borsellino were symbols of hope, of change, but I loved them as people. It was too much for me. I wanted to die. I had to rebuild myself, but it was so hard, so painful.\u201d\nAt moments like this, one catches a glimpse of the heavy price Battaglia paid for her bravery and commitment. Things have changed for the better, she says, but the Mafia remain a malign invisible force in international crime and politics. Her energies are directed elsewhere these days. She is working on an extended project called Nude Palermo. \u201cIt is people of every age and gender \u2013 and now, finally, they are not afraid to show themselves. It is not sexy, it is pride, it is strength. Women are freer inside now, they do not wait for the man\u2019s permission.\u201d\nShe smiles and lights another cigarette. \u201cI am optimistic despite all I have seen,\u201d she says, blowing smoke into the air, \u201cI have to be. Not for me, but for the young people. I can see that they need hope and I have to give it to them. Politics shows them only hate. I can show them beauty. My heart has not hardened with age. Always, there is hope, but you must fight for it.\u201d\n Shooting the Mafia is at selected cinemas from Friday 29 November. There is a special screening, with a talk by director Kim Longinotto, at the Barbican, London, on that date.",

        "content": "Sadler\u2019s Wells, LondonThe Temple of Fine Arts explode with energy and Nahid Siddiqui captivates with her lightness and gravity\nInitially a showcase for Indian classical music, since 2017 the Darbar festival has invited Akram Khan to extend its programme into Indian dance (accompanied, rightly enough, by live music). This year, Khan\u2019s company also organised a training week for classical dancers leading up to the festival, and the first two public events \u2013 studio demonstrations rather than pieces in their own right \u2013 both rounded off this programme and framed the performances on the main stage.\nBoth were eye-opening. Aditi Mangaldas, now 59, draws on her deep experience of kathak dance in a performance-lecture on words in kathak (the term itself comes from the word for \u201cstory\u201d). She shows how the dancing body can bring a story to life, how words are at play in the mind of the performer, and how rhythm \u2013 traditionally learned through a system of vocal syllables \u2013 can tell its own tales through footwork, accent and gesture. Most striking, though, is her exposure of how the classical tradition often requires a female character, pursued by an ardent male, to enact the transformation of a resistant \u201cno\u201d into a coy or flirtatious \u201cyes\u201d. In refusing to perform such fantasies of consent, Mangaldas shows that it is perfectly possible to break classical convention while holding on to classical principles.\nConsiderably older than Mangaldas, Nahid Siddiqui demonstrates that age can reveal what youth may mask. Barely moving at all at first, she nevertheless holds the stage captive with her strange combination of lightness and gravity. In a series of structured improvisations, she draws our attention to the subtleties of kathak style: to melody rather than rhythm, for example, or the way that time can be marked by the flick of a fingertip. It\u2019s like watching stars at night: no longer able to illuminate kathak with the fierce sunshine of youth, Siddiqui shows us instead the finer points of its constellations.\nThe following evening, though, is ablaze with the vigour of youth. Choreographer Mavin Khoo worked with young men from Malaysia\u2019s Temple of Fine Arts to create a bharatanatyam dance based on three scenes from the Ramayana epic. The result is explosive. Bharatanatyam is already a high-impact style, with percussive footwork and \u2013 in marked contrast to kathak\u2019s spirals \u2013 radiant lines that shoot through the limbs and fingers like starbursts. Khoo exploits the prowess and stamina of his performers: all are outstanding (a couple astonishing). By the end of this high-energy 50-minute work, none have lost the exactitude of their execution.\nThe choreography lifts the work above technical display: inventive, evocative and, crucially, with a flair for group work. The dominance of the solo in classical Indian dance means it often treats groups as essentially ordered assemblages of individual units. Here, the ensemble becomes a far more malleable entity, variously evoking a forest, motion-trail afterimages, or the composite, convulsive body of the many-headed demon Ravana. In his distinctive way, Khoo, too, simultaneously breaks and follows the rules.\nThe final piece of the festival feels temperate by comparison. Madhavi Mudgal\u2019s all-female ensemble emphasises the decorousness of the odissi style: hips, shoulders and head inclined in constant contrapposto, arms and spine gracefully curved. Some moments tighten their grip \u2013 a linked line of dancers swivelling like clockwork cogs, or bodies swaying like pliant sculptures \u2013 but this is a largely undemanding if undeniably lovely work, without the heat or the light that has preceded it.",

        "content": "President says parliament\u2019s support is vote of confidence in her \u2018agenda for change\u2019\nUrsula von der Leyen has said the EU as the world\u2019s \u201ctrading superpower\u201d will lead the fight against the \u201cexistential threat\u201d from the climate crisis, and offered a waspish farewell to the Brexit party, as MEPs backed her new European commission to start work on 1 December.\nThe European parliament, sitting in Strasbourg, approved the new college of commissioners, headed by the EU executive\u2019s first female president, by 461 votes to 157 with 89 abstentions on Wednesday, giving her a larger majority than her predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker.\nVon der Leyen said the level of support she had secured, while less than that for Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso in 2004 and 2010, was a vote of confidence in what she described as an \u201cagenda for change\u201d.\nThe Green party, which has been unconvinced by the radicalism of Von der Leyen\u2019s approach, abstained in the vote and anti-EU parties including Italy\u2019s far-right League and France\u2019s National Rally rejected the proposed commission.\nThe commission, which will be formally approved by leaders on the European council on Thursday through a written procedure, is forming a month later than intended as a result of MEPs rejecting the original nominees from Hungary, France and Romania.\nVon der Leyen\u2019s hour-long speech to MEPs lacked the ad-libbing of Juncker, who was never shy of causing controversy, and offered few eye-grabbing policy initiatives. But when Brexit party MEPs clapped and cheered at the mention of Brexit, the incoming commission president strayed from her notes.\n\u201cA vast majority of this house seems to be happy about the fact a very, very, very small group in this house would not be able to clap as loud any more,\u201d Von der Leyen said. \u201cAnd I have never, ever made any secret about that fact that I will always be a remainer.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe will respect the decision taken by the British people. We will work closely together on solutions to common challenges, especially security matters. But one thing has to be absolutely clear: whatever the future holds, the bond and the friendship between our people are unbreakable.\u201d\nVon der Leyen repeatedly emphasised that her top priority upon taking office this Sunday was dealing with the climate emergency and ensuring the end of carbon emissions by the middle of the century. The commission is set to unveil its \u201cgreen deal\u201d on 11 December.\nShe said: \u201cThis is an existential issue for Europe \u2013 and for the world. How can it not be existential when 85% of people in extreme poverty live in the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change? How can it not be existential when we see Venice under water, Portugal\u2019s forests on fire or Lithuania\u2019s harvests cut by half because of droughts? This has happened before but never with the same frequency or intensity.\u201d\nVon der Leyen said the commission would look to robotics to move people out of occupations that she suggested should no longer be carried out by people.\nShe said: \u201cWe will automate work that is wearisome for us humans: carrying heavy loads, performing repetitive tasks in factories or in offices. And this will give us time. Time for what distinguishes human beings. Time for what computers can\u2019t do: empathy and creativity.\u201d\nVon der Leyen said she wanted the commission to be \u201cgeopolitical\u201d. \u201cWe can be the shapers of a better global order\u201d, she said.\nShe made a thinly veiled reference to the policies of Donald Trump in a section of the speech criticising those who sought confrontation and unilateralism.\nOf the transatlantic relationship, she said: \u201cYes, we have issues \u2013 without any doubt. But our ties have lasted the test of time. While we are speaking, thousands of students, researchers, entrepreneurs, artists continue to build zillions of friendships, business contacts and science projects. These myriad of fine threads woven together make a bond that is stronger than any individual point of discord.\u201d\nOn a personal note, Von der Leyen \u2013 who was born in Germany and spent much of her childhood in Brussels where her father was an official \u2013 said her commission would seek to lead in the fight against cancer across the EU.\n\u201cWhen I was a girl, living in Brussels, my little sister died of cancer at the age of 11,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember the utter sense of helplessness of my parents, but also of the medical staff who looked after her with such care. Every one of us has a similar story or knows someone who has. The number of cancer cases is rising but we are getting better at diagnosis and treatment. Europe will take the lead in the fight against cancer.\u201d\nPhil Hogan \u2013 trade Known in Ireland as Big Phil, Hogan will oversee the post-Brexit trade talks. This is his second term in the commission. As agriculture commissioner he was given the nickname Farmer Phil by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Hogan has not shied away from intervening in the Brexit debate: at one point he warned people to ignore the views of the \u201cthree stooges\u201d \u2013 Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg.\nV\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 \u2013 values and transparency In 2006, Jourov\u00e1 spent a month in a Czech jail on false corruption charges. Now she will oversee the sensitive issue of democratic backsliding. Hungary and Poland have been accused of undermining the independence of their judiciaries in recent years. Ursula von der Leyen has suggested she will look to link member states\u2019 record on the rule of law with EU funding.\nVirginijus Sinkevi\u010dius \u2013 environment and the oceans At 29, Lithuanian Sinkevi\u010dius is the youngest ever EU commissioner and the first to be born after the fall of the Berlin wall. He graduated in 2012 with a degree in economics and international relations from Aberystwyth University and has studied courses at the universities of Maastricht and Oxford. He became an economics minister in the Lithuanian government at the age of 27.\nThierry Breton \u2013 internal market A former chairman and chief executive of the IT firm Atos and one-time finance minister under Jacques Chirac, Breton was chosen for this big portfolio by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after MEPs rejected France\u2019s first choice, Sylvie Goulard. She had been accused of using a European parliament assistant for domestic political work when she was an MEP. Breton doubled Atos\u2019s revenues between 2008 and 2019 to around \u20ac12.3bn by moving into cloud computing and big data.\nYlva Johansson \u2013 migration, asylum and internal security Migration remains one of the biggest challenges for the EU, with criticism growing about the bloc\u2019s funding of the Libyan coastguard and the deplorable conditions in which migrants are detained by the authorities in Libya. Johansson, a former minister in the Swedish government, has said she wants a new pact among the member states on migration and an overhaul of asylum rules. But she admitted to MEPs during hearings that there would not be any new proposals during her first 100 days in office.",

        "content": "Ten years ago, Bristol were in the Championship and facing bankruptcy. Today they sit top of the Premiership and have stunned the rugby world by signing the Fiji wing Semi Radradra, one of the standout players at the World Cup, on a three-year contract.\nSince league rugby started in 1987, Bristol have finished in the top half of the elite division only four times and their story in the professional era before Steve Lansdown took over the club in 2012 was largely one of struggle on the field and financially, with the next crisis never far away.\nLansdown is one of the Premiership\u2019s richest owners but he has not used his money to buy success. He started with a long-term plan that was based on the club becoming sustainable and which made establishing links with the community as important as recruiting players of Radradra\u2019s calibre to help sell season tickets.\nPat Lam, the Bears\u2019 director of rugby, said: \u201cEvery top club in both codes across the planet wanted to sign Semi Radradra, so for Bristol to be able to bring in a player of his quality shows the fantastic work that the club is doing. As a person and a player, he is perfect for our culture which places an emphasis on community and high performance.\u201d\nLam\u2019s own decision to sign a new contract at the end of last season was more significant for Lansdown than any player he has brought in. As a player Lam captained Samoa and led Northampton in their 2000 Heineken Cup final victory over Munster at Twickenham. He joined Bristol in 2017 from Connacht, where he had guided the least celebrated of Ireland\u2019s four provinces to the Pro12 title. Bristol had just been relegated after a first season in the Premiership for seven years. They came straight back and were never in danger of going down last season, even if a ninth-place finish underwhelmed Lam, whose ambition was a top-six slot rather than survival.\nThe signing of Radradra, who can play wing or centre, is more than a statement of intent by Bristol. They are also being linked with the England and Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler and the Wales flanker Justin Tipuric, who is out of contract at the Ospreys at the end of the season. The Welsh region, who parted company with their head coach, Allen Clarke, this week after a poor run of results \u2013 although no one was allowed to speak about the matter at a media briefing on Wednesday \u2013 are struggling financially and would not be able to match the Bears.\nEarlier this year, Lam said before he signed a player he assessed their character as well as their ability: \u201cLaying down roots is the key for all successful teams. You need a core group of guys who understand the culture. If a player comes here just to get paid, he is in the wrong place.\n\u201cBeing a Bristol Bear is about more than rugby and we want players whose hunger to succeed is based on a dream. Players here enjoy doing community work because it is part of the vision they were sold on.\u201d\nLam met Radradra over the weekend after Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles\u2019s European Challenge Cup draw in Edinburgh last Friday. \u201cI worked with him during my time with the Barbarians,\u201d Lam said. \u201cI saw what he was like off the field and said that if he ever wanted to come to the UK to give me a call. His agent got in touch during the World Cup and said Semi was keen to join.\n\u201cI wanted him to see Bristol and he got here last Saturday. I picked him up and took him to Ashton Gate. He was blown away by it. It was bucketing down with rain, but he saw how good the playing surface was and I showed him plans of our new training facility, which will be finished in May and will be the best in the northern hemisphere, I reckon. I then took him up there and gave him time to breathe on it. I put an offer to him on Monday, he signed it the next day and we announced it today.\u201d\nRadradra will become Bristol\u2019s second marquee player after the full-back Charles Piutau, who is in his final season of a \u00a31m-a-year contract and will be offered a new one. \u201cWith marquee players, it is not about competing with other Premiership clubs but the top teams in the world,\u201d said Lam.\n\u201cWe are well below the salary cap and we are not interested in anything that is not legal. I look at every rugby player who is available and have turned down some very good ones because they were not the right fit here. That is the importance of having a plan: previously at Bristol, there wasn\u2019t one.\u201d",

His infatuation with Donald Trump could drag us to an economic model that is really bad for working people. Trump has got his fingerprints all over the Tories.\u201d\nO\u2019Grady said the election provided a choice between two competing philosophies, adding that fundamental rights were at risk.\n\u201cThe question is what is going to happen in Britain under Boris Johnson \u2013 not just a hard Brexit but a turn towards the US and a Trump way of organising working life.\u201d\nO\u2019Grady said that in the US it was far more common for workers to be on zero-hours contracts, there was no national protection against the sack, no statutory sick pay, no holiday pay and no maternity pay.\n\u201cIs that the model we want to follow? We know that Boris Johnson is a big admirer of Donald Trump.\u201d In a reference to the president\u2019s love of golf, she said: \u201cWe talk about becoming Trump\u2019s poodles, but you could say there is a risk of becoming Trump\u2019s caddies.\u201d\nThe Conservatives have announced the biggest increase in public spending in 15 years and pledged to increase the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to \u00a310.50 within five years as part of a strategy designed to appeal to blue-collar voters in Labour\u2019s traditional heartlands.\nO\u2019Grady said she did not believe in the rebranding of the Conservatives as the party of working people.\n\u201cThe Conservatives have form. It is not the first time they have tried to appeal to blue-collar voters nor the first time that they have underestimated them. Working-class voters know that families matter and they know what the parties are offering families.\n\u201cThe manifesto is so thin the question must be what lies behind it. Do we trust them? No. Do we think there is worse to come? Yes. Donald Trump is the role model. Look at how workers are treated in the US. I think Boris Johnson will use Brexit as an excuse for every attack on workers\u2019 rights in the book.\u201d\nO\u2019Grady said Labour was right to challenge the idea that the election was just about Brexit. It was also, she added, about why people couldn\u2019t get to see a doctor, why waiting times for hospital treatment were going up, why wages were stagnating and why workers\u2019 rights were being eroded.\nLabour had an alternative vision involving a safety net of rights from day one of employment, a \u00a310 minimum wage for all workers, a ban on zero-hour contracts, freedom to organise, and a change in the balance of power between workers and employers.\nAsked whether she was concerned that Labour\u2019s minimum wage plans for all workers might cost jobs, O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThere is plenty of headroom to improve minimum pay and we say people should get the rate for the job.\n\u201cOf course we want to see jobs protected but there is no evidence currently that significant increases in the minimum wage would harm jobs. There is evidence that the sweat shop model is too prevalent in Britain today. There are whole industries that could and should pay more.\u201d",

This quietly enraging documentary by lifelong Hackney, London, resident Zed Nelson tackles gentrification by looking at Hoxton Street \u2013 for years a bastion of East End cockneyism with its pie and mash shop, fruit\u2019n\u2019veg market and more pubs than can possibly be healthy on one street. Nelson filmed for four years, capturing the end of a way of life as the craft beer shops and art galleries move in, followed by property developers catching the whiff of profit.\nThe launderette is gone, the carpet shop on its way out. Bemused locals mutter about \u201cyuppies\u201d. The baker\u2019s closes after 150 years. A media company arrives, installing a bath full of rubber balls for staff to sit in and get their creative juices flowing.\nColleen, 82, has lived in the area all her life. Errol the mechanic, who\u2019s been here for donkey\u2019s, says he gets three or four property developers a month trying to buy his garage. The film tells an inconvenient truth about gentrification \u2013 that, while newcomers get a kick moving into an \u201cedgy\u201d area, often there\u2019s not much in it for the locals. \u201cI felt like an outcast,\u201d says a teenage girl about a visit to a fancy coffee shop. It\u2019s them and us.\nThe housing crisis is at the root of many problems in Hoxton Street. Colin lives in a \u00a3235-a-week studio the size of prison cell in an ex-council house, now split into three tiny flats, all rented back to the council. The local church runs a soup kitchen to feed desperate people struggling with benefits cuts. Nelson doesn\u2019t soft soap local attitudes about who\u2019s to blame; many focus their anger on \u201cforeigners who can\u2019t talk our English\u201d; the Brexit debate rages.\nMeanwhile, luxury tower blocks go up, with cinemas, concierges, gyms and zero social housing provision. Nelson is shown around a \u00a31m apartment; it\u2019s a little on the snug side, the estate agent explains, so they\u2019ve put the kitchen in the hallway. An unmissable portrait of modern London.\n The Street is released in the UK on 29 November.",

Neither registration requirements for domestic pets nor food safety and biosecurity registration requirements for agricultural animals apply to horses.\nNew South Wales Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi called for the committee to be established in November 2018, citing a Guardian Australia report about the fate of racehorses sold at Echuca saleyards. The committee was chaired by Labor senator Glenn Sterle.\n\u201cWhat stuck in my mind was a picture of a chestnut thoroughbred with a white patch on its forehead, sitting on the ground of the saleyard pen with ribs poking through its skin,\u201d said Faruqi. \u201cThe caption read: \u2018This 11-year-old thoroughbred last raced in 2014 and had total winnings of more than $100,000. He sells for $340.\u2019\u201d\nSitting in the public gallery of the Senate when the report was tabled were Julianna and Mark Waugh, whose daughter, Sarah, died in a fall from an off-the-track racehorse used in a jillaroo training program at Dubbo Tafe in 2009. They have been campaigning for a traceability register for 10 years, arguing that it could have saved Sarah\u2019s life.\nFaruqi said the level of support from industry stakeholders was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Both Racing Australia and Australian Harness Racing and their state counterparts supported the proposal. Of more than 70 submissions received, just two, both from individuals, opposed the idea.\nState and territory racing ministers resolved last week to write to federal agriculture minister Bridget Mckenzie to give their in-principle support for a national traceability register for all horses, not just ex-racing thoroughbreds.\nThe federal government is the only stakeholder not to pledge its support.\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s response to this report will be a great opportunity for them to show some leadership, which has been sorely missing,\u201d Faruqi said.",

His predecessor Malcolm Turnbull said he would never have made the call, because the inquiry needs to be seen as independent and free of political influence.\nIpp, who served on the NSW court of appeal and as an Independent Commission Against Corruption commissioner, said the call was clearly not appropriate. He said it appears to have been made to aid Morrison\u2019s party-political decision-making, rather than the interest of the state.\n\u201cAn ordinary citizen would not be able to get that information from the police \u2026 so what is it about the prime minister that entitles him to that information?\u201d Ipp told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see that it\u2019s information that relates to matters of state interest. It can only relate to matters of party interest. If it relates to matters of party interest then he\u2019s using his influence as prime minister to try to obtain the information so that he can make the politically correct decision \u2013 that is, whether to keep Taylor or to fire him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate. It\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d\nMorrison and Fuller have a pre-existing relationship. Fuller told Sydney\u2019s 2GB radio station last year that he used to be Morrison\u2019s neighbour, and that the prime minister had collected his bins when he went away.\n\u201cHe was the treasurer at the time,\u201d Fuller said at the time. \u201cHe did tell me recently that he\u2019s the prime minister now, and that should be Josh Frydenberg\u2019s job, but he won\u2019t take my calls! He\u2019s a neighbour of mine and I do wish him well \u2013 he\u2019s a very good neighbour.\u201d\nGuardian Australia approached Fuller for comment but was yet to receive a response.\nFuller did, however, tell the Australian that the conversation with Morrison was \u201cextremely short\u201d and one that gave \u201cno more or less information than what was in the media release\u201d.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a police commissioner making decisions to [conduct] an open and transparent investigation then suggest there\u2019s something inappropriate in relation to receiving a phone call. It\u2019s hypocrisy to say that,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\u201cIt was an extremely short conversation in that he just wanted confirmation we were conducting an investigation.\u201d\nIpp said the controversy was the kind that could be investigated by a properly constituted federal anti-corruption commission.\nHe said calls of the type Morrison made were extremely rare.\n\u201cNo premier, certainly in my experience in NSW, would ever dared to have called up and said how far is the investigation gone on this and what are you going to do about it?\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut the prime minister is apparently able to do it with the NSW police, and that in this day and age leaves one with a rather uncomfortable feeling.\u201d",

        "content": "There is plenty of data to support Reserve Bank hints that interest rate cuts aren\u2019t enough to get the economy moving\nThe latest construction figures, released yesterday by the bureau of statistics, provide yet more evidence of the weakness in the economy over the past year. They also are a solid support to comments by the governor of the Reserve Bank who has again subtly called for more action from the public sector.\nOn Tuesday night the head of the RBA, Philip Lowe, spoke on unconventional monetary policy. It was the type of speech that had investors watching closely for some sign of whether the RBA was contemplating measures such as negative interest rates or quantitative easing (QE).\nThe upshot was that the RBA has been contemplating it, but only in thought, not deed. Lowe suggested \u201cthe threshold for undertaking QE in Australia has not been reached, and I don\u2019t expect it to be reached in the near future\u201d.\nHe suggested that due to bank margins the effective lower bound of the cash rate is 0.25%, and with the current rate at 0.75%, Lowe gave the strongest indication he could that he does not see two cuts in the cash rate about to occur.\nAnd yet the market still predicts at least one more cut, to 0.50%, to occur by May next year:\nAnd so there is a very strong likelihood that we will soon be just one rate cut from the Reserve Bank having no more ability to cut rates.\nThat is a pretty slim margin of error.\nLowe\u2019s speech also contained yet another reminder to everyone, and particularly the government, that monetary policy is not the only way to stimulate the economy.\nHe noted that one problem with engaging in unconventional measures is that it \u201cmight create an inaction bias by other policymakers, either the prudential regulators or the fiscal authorities. If this were the case, it could lead to an over-reliance on monetary policy.\u201d\nAnd certainly it is clear from the latest construction figures that we have been over-reliant on monetary policy.\nFor the fifth quarter in a row, the volume of construction work in Australia fell:\nThe level of engineering construction that occurred in the September quarter was as low as it has been any time in the past 12 years, and building construction was the lowest it has been for over a year.\nThe 8.1% annual fall of total construction is the biggest annual fall since the middle of 2016:\nOne thing that is quite clear is that the residential building boom that occurred off the back of the interest rate cuts from November 2010 onwards is now over.\nThat boom, which was primarily about apartment buildings in NSW and Victoria, saw residential construction in those two states far outpace the rest of the country:\nOnly in Victoria is residential construction higher now than it was a year ago and yet its 1.5% growth is well below the average of the past five years:\nAnd yet while the private sector has shrunk, the public sector has failed over the past year to fill the gap.\nLowe noted \u201cwe need to remember that monetary policy cannot drive longer-term growth, but that there are other arms of public policy than can sustainably promote both investment and growth\u201d.\nClearly that was forgotten in the past 12 years.\nOver the past year, while private sector construction work has fallen, so too has public-sector work:\nThis is counter to standard economics as occurred during the GFC and in the period after, where the public sector acts to counter to private sector \u2013 when the private sector is struggling, public sector work increases and vice versa.\nLittle wonder that the government is now madly going around bringing forward projects.\nYesterday however, global ratings agency S&P warned against a fiscal stimulus program which \u201cinvolves substantial spending initiatives and changes the trajectory of the budget\u201d. S&P suggested such a move \u201ccould increase downward pressure on our rating and outlook for Australia\u201d.\nGiven Australia is just one of 11 nations with a AAA credit rating by S&P, the government would be loathe to lose this status. And yet the reasoning behind the advice is pretty flimsy.\nS&P argued that \u201cwhile spending initiatives are likely to support the economy, they\u2019re also likely to weaken Australia\u2019s fiscal flexibility to respond to future unforeseen economic shocks\u201d.\nIn effect, S&P argue for a reduced fiscal response to our current weak economy for fear of lessening the ability to respond in the future.\nAnd yet such a path means greater pressure is put on monetary policy, thus weakening the RBA\u2019s ability to respond to any unforeseen future shocks.\nGlobal ratings agencies, like the government, care more about the budget balance than providing a balanced response to the current weak economy.\nThe main consequence of a downgrade of our credit rating would be that the interest rate paid by the government for its borrowing may rise (and yet even this is uncertain). With the government currently being able to borrow at record lows, and well below inflation, it is rather curious to be worried about rising interest rates:\nOne of the most common reasons given for a budget surplus is to provide room for future fiscal spending, should the economy weaken. And yet what is clear from the speech by the head of the Reserve Bank is that the government\u2019s surplus mania has reduced the ability for the RBA to respond to any future shocks.\nAnd what is clear from the construction figures is that the low interest rates are failing to have the impact required to spur the strong economic activity needed to get wages and incomes rising.\n Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The move comes two years after Axa revealed plans to end its support for controversial US oil pipelines linked to tar sands.\nThe French insurer will also stop underwriting policies for companies that plan to invest in any coal-fired power project larger than 300MW. Instead, it will offer companies \u201ctransition\u201d bonds to help finance a shift to cleaner energy, and will double its green investments ambition to reach \u20ac24bn (\u00a319.6bn) by 2023.\nThomas Buberl, the chief executive of Axa, said the new phase of its climate strategy will accelerate its contribution to a resilient, low-carbon economy, by focusing its efforts towards the energy transition of major industries.\n\u201cIt is an absolute priority if we want to reach the objectives of the Paris agreement,\u201d he added.\nAxa\u2019s climate pledge comes amid rising pressure on banks and financial services companies to cut ties with the global coal industry to help protect the environment and safeguard long-term investments.\nGermany\u2019s Allianz and Italy\u2019s Generali agreed to limit underwriting for coal companies last year, and Lloyds of London began excluding coal from its investment strategy from April 2018.\nGreen groups described Axa\u2019s anti-coal plans as a baseline for others to follow.\nLucie Pinson, an adviser for Friends of the Earth France\u2019s campaign on private finance, said Axa had set \u201ca new global benchmark for best practice with this coal phase-out policy\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cZero tolerance for coal expansion is the only responsible action in a carbon-constrained world.

Miller rose to prominence in the 1960s as part of the irreverent satirical show Beyond the Fringe, alongside Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.\nHe studied medicine at Cambridge University, qualifying as a doctor in 1959. He combined his early stage appearances with hospital rounds. But he was soon in demand as a theatre director, in London and New York, and also worked with the BBC, presenting cultural programmes and adapting plays for television.\nHe made his debut as a theatre director in 1962 with a production of John Osborne\u2019s Under Plain Cover. He went on to direct several celebrated Shakespeare productions including the Merchant of Venice at the National Theatre. It described him as a \u201clegendary figure\u201d.\nHe also directed a series of critically acclaimed operas in a 40-year career that began in the 1970s for the English National Opera. The Guardian described his contemporary production of Cos\u00ec fan tutte for the Royal Opera House in 1995 as \u201ca compelling piece of music theatre, wonderful in its delineation of Mozart\u2019s mix of comedy and psychological pain\u201d. His Don Pasquale in 2004 was hailed by the paper as a \u201cHogarthian satire of considerable viciousness\u201d.\nIn 2007 he made a foray into museum curation with an exhibition about camouflage at the Imperial War Museum. Miller who was a committed atheist, also wrote and presented a 2004 series on the history of disbelief. The National Secular Society said it \u201cbroke the hegemony of religion on the BBC\u201d.\nMiller shared his insights and enthusiasms from his career in the arts and medicine in a number of television documentaries, which he wrote and presented for the BBC. They included the 1978 series the The Body in Question, which led to spin-off popup book; a five-part series on Madness in 1991; a series on directing opera in 1997; and On Reflection, a 1998 documentary on art.\nMiller was a lifelong friend of the writer and neuroscientist Oliver Sacks whom he met at St Paul\u2019s School, London. Sacks, who died in 2015, said that without Miller\u2019s inspiration he would never have his bestselling book Awakenings.\nRemembering Jonathan Miller, polymath and lifelong best friend of Oliver Sacks.

However, I can\u2019t, as my supervisors were busy at the start and now are striking.\n\u201cI will have to explain this absence and answer questions about my time management, even though it\u2019s outside of my control. Many international students are feeling pressured to cross the picket line, and cannot afford to fall behind/have absences.\u201d\nA university administrator at one Russell Group university said she had spent the morning dealing with significant numbers of panicked students, especially international students on Tier 4 visas whose attendance is routinely monitored. \u201cOur student welfare services are stretched at the best of times, now, they are overrun,\u201d she said.\nOrdinarily, if an international student misses 10 consecutive teaching sessions, the university is obliged to report them to the immigration authorities. According to the University and College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, an absence due to industrial action should not be included, but if a Tier 4 sponsored student misses a lecture by non-striking staff to show support for the strike, this would be considered an unauthorised absence and would therefore count.\nThere are also fears that international students may be unclear as to whether their lecturer is on strike or not \u2013 not all staff are involved in industrial action \u2013 and erroneously skip a lecture thinking it has been cancelled.\nMore than 40,000 university staff \u2013 including academics, technicians, librarians and professional services staff \u2013 are in the middle of eight days of strike action over pay, pensions and working conditions, with picket lines disrupting campuses across the UK.\nAround a million students are affected by the industrial action. Many have come out in support of their lecturers and other university staff on picket lines and there have been a number of student occupations of university buildings at Edinburgh, Strathclyde and Stirling universities. Of the students who contacted the Guardian, most said they supported the strikes, with only a small number demanding compensation.\nSeventy student activist groups and student unions issued a statement in support of the UCU strikes, calling on university managers to issue a public statement cancelling all student attendance registers on strike days, including classes ongoing during strike action.\n\u201cMonitoring migrant students\u2019 attendance on strike days amounts to the cynical use of students\u2019 visa precarity against workers\u2019 right to industrial action,\u201d said the statement, which was supported by groups including the National Union of Students, People & Planet, Rent Strike and Student Climate Action.\nEarlier this week, the University of Liverpool came in for criticism after managers sent an email to undergraduates on Friday warning them it was unlawful to join pickets. In the same email, international students were informed that anyone who chose not to cross picket lines to attend teaching sessions risked jeopardising their visa.\nAs a result nine external examiners in the school of law resigned their roles in protest, accusing Liverpool of misrepresenting the law regarding support for official pickets and of \u201cweaponising\u201d the UK immigration system against visa-holding students.\nThe immigration advisory service at Goldsmiths, University of London, emailed international students on 22 November, telling them their visa status would not be affected by academic sessions cancelled because of industrial action, but warning they must attend academic sessions which take place as scheduled.\nRobert Liow, international students\u2019 officer at Goldsmiths, said: \u201cThis creates a climate of fear. International students on Tier 4 visas have been stripped of their right to choose solidarity and not cross the picket line during the strikes with punitive action that puts their visa status and future career in the UK at risk.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Goldsmiths, University of London, said the email was a regular reminder sent in the autumn term every year, as part of a range of support and information shared with international students.\nThe UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cThreatening students who simply want to support their striking lecturers is an underhand tactic that rather reeks of desperation. In the current climate universities should be doing all they can to show off the UK as a welcoming place for international students to come and study, not making short-term threats because they refuse to tackle serious problems at the heart of these disputes.\u201d\nThe UCU is to re-ballot a further 13 universities ahead of possible further action in the new year. The re-ballots will start next week and will run until the end of January, to bolster support for a second wave of action if the disputes cannot be resolved.",

The study excludes California, one of the most populous states in the nation. This study examined the abortion rate from 2007 to 2016.\nResearchers found the abortion rate declined from 188 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2015, to 186 abortions in 2016, and 26% over the entire period of the study. The agency found a total of 623,471 abortions in 2016, the vast majority in the first trimester.\nMost women who terminated a pregnancy were in their 20s, had never had an abortion, and already had children.\nOther recent studies suggest the declining abortion rate is not the result of high-profile abortions restrictions passed during the Trump administration \u2013 such as six-week abortion bans now hung up in court. Rather, declining abortions rates coincide with declining fertility rates, suggesting fewer women are getting pregnant.\nThe study follows the September release of data from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights nonprofit. Guttmacher\u2019s data is considered more comprehensive than government data, because the organization individually contacts abortion providers. CDC data typically captures about 70% of the abortions reported by Guttmacher.\n\u201cWhen we talk about the abortion rate, we are really talking about reproductive autonomy,\u201d Dr Herminia Palacio, the president and CEO of Guttmacher, said at the time their data was released. \u201cIt\u2019s the right for people to make their own choices about when to get pregnant, when not to get pregnant, and what to do if they are pregnant and don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\nGuttmacher\u2019s analysis found two major trends: there is a growing abortion access divide regionally, with fewer clinics in the south and midwest, and that declining abortion rates are probably the result of fewer pregnancies.",

Police and ambulances had to be called to some outlets.\nNow, instead of a single day of offers, most big retailers, including Amazon, John Lewis and Argos, spread their offers over more than a week to ease pressure on stores and home-delivery networks.\nThe switch to online also means shoppers can hunt for early bargains using mobile phones rather than queuing up in the early hours to tussle over a cut-price TV.\nWhile Tesco, John Lewis and Debenhams will open some stores earlier than usual, most retailers will post their bargains online first.\nZoe Mills, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said Black Friday had also become less of a novelty, and shoppers wanted to see steeper discounts on the day because of widespread price-cutting throughout the year.\nShe said the event was still a big day for retailers, because shoppers making planned purchases often delay their spending and wait for the discount day, while other shoppers brought forward their spending to cash in on the lower prices for Christmas gifts.\n\u201cHowever, its influence is waning as growth is forecast to be 2.2% versus 3.5% in 2018. We are also seeing an increasing number of retailers discount ahead of the promotional event, often depicting these sales as a pre-Black Friday promotion.\u201d\nInterest has also been dampened by evidence that many of the deals are not genuine bargains. Research released by Which? this week suggested the event was \u201call hype\u201d and that 19 in 20 Black Friday discounts were not real bargains. Several retailers disputed the group\u2019s findings.\nMills said sustainability concerns in 2019 meant an increasing number of consumers and retailers now shun the event.\nThe ethical footwear retailer Allbirds, for example, is this year emptying its London flagship store and turning it into \u201ca space for inspiration and innovation\u201d, including gigs.\nThere were some high street queues last year \u2013 at Aldi, for example, where shoppers lined up to buy Kevin the Carrot cuddly toys. But the overall number of shoppers in stores was down 6%.\nHowever, online spending rose 7%, according to the trade body IMRG. It said sales growth had been dampened by the timing of Black Friday last year, which put it ahead of the final pay day before Christmas for many.",

On 25 July in the House of Commons, the day after he was appointed prime minister, he told MPs: \u201cI will make one important point that it is worth making: under no circumstances will we agree to any free-trade deal that puts the NHS on the table. It is not for sale.\u201d\nHe has repeated that position during the election campaign, including on 19 November in the ITV leadership debate. \u201cThere are no circumstances \u2026 in which this government or any Conservative will put the NHS on the table in any free-trade negotiation,\u201d he said.\nAfter the publication of the unredacted record of trade talks between the UK and US, he maintained the line while campaigning in Cornwall on Wednesday. \u201cThe NHS is not on the table in any way,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe documents show that between July 2017 and July this year, trade talks between the UK and US have covered the NHS, drug pricing and patents, the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices, in the context of the future trade landscape between the two countries.\nUS trade officials explained clearly their approach to trade talks, described as \u201cnegative listing\u201d, which involves starting the talks with nothing off the table, the assumption being that total market access is the starting point for any discussions.\nThe UK has some of the lowest drug prices in Europe. A key reason for that is the existence of the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government set up in 1999. It is an independent expert body that assesses evidence and issues guidance to the NHS and health professionals about which drugs, types of surgery and other forms of treatment benefit patients and are worth spending money on. As such it determines what drugs do and do not represent value for money for NHS bodies in England and Wales to buy to give to patients.\nNice has a ceiling of \u00a330,000 per year of \u201cgood quality life\u201d gained, rising to \u00a350,000 for end-of-life drugs such as cancer drugs. Nice\u2019s judgments help keep prices down by capping what the NHS can spend on them. So does the NHS\u2019s status as a bulk buyer of drugs, and EU-wide rules on patents.\nThe minutes of the trade talks show the Trump administration and US pharmaceutical interests want the British government to dismantle the safeguards that protect the NHS from paying high prices for drugs. (Drugs in America cost two and a half times what they cost in the UK.)\nThey want, for example, \u201cfull market access\u201d for US drugs, which would greatly limit Nice\u2019s ability to decide which medicines patients can receive. They also want future prices to be \u201cmarket-derived\u201d or \u201ccompetitive\u201d, which again would lead to Nice being marginalised.\nCrucially, US officials want longer patents for American drugs, which would boost their makers\u2019 profits and limit the NHS\u2019s scope to buy much cheaper generic versions. They have suggested in the talks a number of changes, all of which \u2013 if agreed \u2013 would benefit pharma firms financially. They include \u201cpatent linkage\u201d, grace periods and \u201cpatent term extension and adjustment\u201d, which UK officials described as \u201cthe three big defensive areas for us\u201d in detailed discussions about drug patents.\nThis is a difficult issue for the UK because it is a leading member of the European Patent Convention, though it is not an EU body.",

        "content": "Tata Steel is to make nearly one in eight of its British workforce redundant\nPort Talbot steelworks owner Tata Steel has confirmed it is to cut up to 1,000 jobs in the UK, as part of wider cost reduction plans.\nThe job losses are part of a plan that would cost 3,000 jobs across Europe. About 1,600 jobs would go at plants in the Netherlands, with another 350 elsewhere around the world.\nThe company said that two-thirds would be white-collar management and office-based jobs. The UK cuts mean that nearly one in eight of its British workforce would be made redundant.\nThe company said the job losses were part of a turnaround programme designed to boost sales and slash costs.\nIndian-owned Tata Group bought the business in April 2007, when it was called Corus and re-branded it under its own name in 2010.\nAlmost half of Tata\u2019s UK staff are based at its Port Talbot site, which employs about 4,000 people.\nThe scale of the job losses came as a shock to unions, who said they were not consulted before the cuts were announced. The trade union Community had previously said it would fight to hold Tata to a jobs guarantee that lasted until 2021.\nTata Steel\u2019s chief executive for Europe, Henrik Adam, said: \u201cWe cannot afford to stand still as a company \u2013 the world around us is changing fast and we have to adapt. Our strategy is to build a strong and stable European business, capable of making significant investments needed for a successful future.\u201d\nHe said the business was operating in \u201ca very tough market\u201d and added: \u201cI understand and appreciate colleagues\u2019 concerns about these proposals.\u201d\nCommunity, which represents steelworkers, said it was \u201cseriously concerned about the direction that Tata Steel Europe is taking\u201d. It said it wanted to see \u201ca vision for the future, which includes plans for investment\u201d.\n\u201cWe have been presented with short-term plans, which only create worry and uncertainty.\n\u201cIt feels like the company is just managing decline and we need a significant change of direction that can inspire the workforce that they have a future.\u201d\nThe union blamed the cuts on Tata\u2019s \u201cfailure to have a plan B\u201d following the collapse of a planned merger with Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp, which would have created Europe\u2019s second biggest steelmaker. The European commission blocked the deal citing pricing and competition concerns.\nDavid Rees, the Labour Welsh assembly member for Aberavon, told the BBC the \u201cuncertainty\u201d of not knowing where the UK roles would be cut \u201cdoes not help steelworkers, their families and the wider community\u201d.\nSuzy Davies, the Conservative AM for South Wales West, said it was \u201cextremely distressing for all of the Port Talbot Tata Steel workers and their families\u201d.\nTata \u2013 which three years ago planned to sell the UK business but eventually decided to keep the plants and invest \u00a31bn in updating them \u2013 first announced plans for job cuts last week. It blamed a drop in demand for steel across the EU for the job cuts, which it said was made worse by global trade tensions. It also cited an increase in the cost of emissions allowances for the heavily polluting industry.\nAlongside the job cuts, Tata spelled out plans to change the way the business works. The plans include producing and selling higher value steels, improving the production process and buying cheaper.\nThe job cuts come at a tough time for the UK steel industry. About 4,000 jobs were recently saved at British Steel after the Chinese firm Jingye agreed to buy the company\u2019s Scunthorpe site.",

I never thought the bulldogs wrapping around his hands meant gang member. I mean, he was a dog lover, and he was Dad.\nYou never really know your parents\u2019 life before you were born, right, even when it\u2019s written across their bodies. You only know the person who is, your mum or dad in the here and now, and it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine they\u2019re someone other people might fear. This is why it took almost 10 years to figure out that the thing on Dad\u2019s head was the reason people were locking their car doors when our family was walking past.\nAnd in one sense, who can blame them? \u201cGang member\u201d is a vivid signifier, and to most people it signals all the worst things: crime, violence, and a community gone wrong. Never mind that you\u2019re far more likely to suffer violence at the hands of someone you know than at the hands of a random bloke with a patch.\nStereotypes are hard to shake and overestimating a gang\u2019s impact on people\u2019s lives and communities is one reason the \u201cwar on gang\u201d rhetoric is so effective, even if as a policy it fails time after time. In a play to this very overestimate National leader Simon Bridges is promising a police unit to quite literally harass gang members. Its name: \u201cStrike Force Raptor\u201d.\nAustralian readers might recognise the borrowing: New South Wales police operate their own Strike Force Raptor, using the specialist unit to disrupt gang activities across the state. The unit takes a no-policing-measure-too-small approach, doing everything from suspending bikie\u2019s licenses for minor infractions to raiding their gang headquarters and confiscating assets.\nThe approach is National\u2019s inspiration. Bridges praises the unit as a \u201cremarkable success\u201d. And in a small way he\u2019s right. Motorcycle gangs across the eastern state are on the back foot. Famous clubhouses and grog pits are shut down. Some estimate membership numbers are down.\nThe irony is New South Wales can thank New Zealand for that. At the heart of Raptor\u2019s strategy are the 501s, deportees with tenuous links to New Zealand \u2013 often no more than citizenship from an accident of birth \u2013 who are \u201csent back\u201d. The deportees are in large part responsible for the growth in gang numbers and organised crime in New Zealand. Most arrive with no family or memory of their new home. Their social connections are west. So too their economic connections. Often they just pick up right where they left off as Comancheros or Bandidos or Hells Angels.\nSo this is the question Bridges must answer: why copy-cat the Aussie unit responsible for exporting its own gang problem here? We can hardly return the members our own Raptors might catch, immediately making them less effective than their Australian parent. There\u2019s no on-sending to another country either. Instead the tools available to disrupt gangs and diminish their numbers and impact are the same as always: employment, housing, education, and public health.\nThink about it this way. More than a third of all New Zealand prisoners have gang connections of one kind or another. Over 60% suffer from a traumatic brain injury. Approximately 70% suffer from numeracy and literacy problems.\nIs this really a gang problem or is this a health and education crisis?\nThe latter, surely. That makes it a crisis of successive governments\u2019 own making. Nowhere is this more obvious and more tragic than in the royal commission into abuse in care where former state ward after former state ward testified they were driven into the arms of gangs after violence and abuse in state institutions.\nIn other words, \u201cthe war on gangs\u201d \u2013 that phrase swapping the dogwhistle for the megaphone \u2013 isn\u2019t necessarily won with criminal law policy. It\u2019s best won in social policy. If you meant your Raptors policy as gang-buster rather than vote-winner you might realise as much.\nOf course none of this is to suggest gangs or organised crime aren\u2019t a problem. In a decent society they wouldn\u2019t exist. The trouble, for me at least, is I find the political rhetoric that shapes people\u2019s understanding of gangs difficult to square with I know. I live in Kawerau, a Mob stronghold, and a good number of my old mates from school are gang members. Yet none, as far as I know, and I know them well, are drug manufacturers or dealers or hustlers. None have any criminal convictions. They\u2019re certainly not \u201cviolent\u201d in that wonton way people think gang members are. Even the stats support that. Violent crime involving gang members is dropping. Instead what unites these people is a lack of job opportunities, of educational opportunities.\nIf I could say one thing to Simon Bridges that would be it, and I\u2019d gently suggest perhaps the best use for his Raptors is putting them to work as teachers and job creators rather than cops.",

It requested a \u201cpreliminary investigation of incitement to genocide and widespread systematic attacks against indigenous peoples\u201d by Bolsonaro.\nBensouda will now request information from governments of Brazilian states and other countries, the United Nations and other intergovernmental organisations, NGOs and other sources to decide whether to request authorisation for an investigation, the groups said.\nThe non-partisan group of lawyers, former ministers and civil society activists said they had taken this drastic step against their own president because they believed Brazil faced an emergency situation.\n\u201cWe believe there are elements that characterise genocide,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Carlos Dias, a former justice minister under the centre-right president Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\nDias presides the Arns Commission, a human rights group named after the late Cardenal Dom Paulo Evaristo Arns, who helped victims of police and political repression during Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship.\n\u201cIt is very sad to see the president of Brazil face this process but it is necessary to protect the rights of our people,\u201d Dias said. \u201cThe steps the government is taking remind me of the steps the dictatorship took.\u201d\nSince taking power in January, Bolsonaro has repeatedly denigrated Brazil\u2019s indigenous people \u2013 comparing them to animals in zoos and \u201cprehistoric men\u201d \u2013 and overseen efforts to to dismantle Funai, the already underfunded agency supposed to protect Brazil\u2019s more than 300 tribes. He has also pushed to open up indigenous reserves to mining companies.\nThe document presented to the court argues that \u201cunder the pretext of developing the Amazon Region, the Bolsonaro administration is turning government policy into encouragement for attacks on Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples and their lands\u201d.\nIt says there was a \u201cpreconceived plan\u201d behind the \u201cmistreatment and disrespect\u201d for the rights of Brazil\u2019s nearly one million indigenous people.\nThe brief argues that Bolsonaro attacks traditional indigenous life because it is \u201champering the national development plans that the president intends to promote through infrastructure projects, mining enterprises, logging activities and agribusiness ventures in forested regions\u201d.\nAs a result \u201cthe living conditions and lifestyles of the indigenous peoples are being destroyed by river pollution and invasion of their lands by wildcat miners, loggers and land-grabbers,\u201d it says, noting the recent 29% increase in annual deforestation \u2013 the highest rate in a decade. Bolsonaro said after those devastating numbers emerged that Amazon fires and deforestation were cultural and would never end.\n\u201cWe are facing a scenario of incitement of crimes against humanity,\u201d said Elo\u00edsa Machado, a professor of constitutional law at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation and CADHu member.\nIn preparing their brief, the lawyers analysed 33 comments and decisions by the president, including the dismissal of 21 of 27 superintendents at the environment agency Ibama and Bolsonaro\u2019s efforts to weaken Funai.\nThey also cited Bolsonaro\u2019s attempt to discredit his own government\u2019s statistics, which he dismissed as \u201clies\u201d after figures showed that deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon had surged to the highest level since the current monitoring method began.\n\u201cBolsonaro\u2019s actions, words and omissions on environmental rights in Brazil may be categorised as attacks on its civilian population,\u201d the document says.\nMachado said they decided on an international court because any Brazilian investigation would fall under the prosecutor-general \u2013 chosen by Bolsonaro. \u201cOur national justice system is not capable of an independent and impartial investigation into President Jair Messias Bolsonaro,\u201d she said.\nJuliana dos Santos, a CADHu lawyer said that \u201cdehumanising\u201d indigenous people was a \u201cstrategy to justify violence against populations and public policies designed to reduce the control of these populations over their land\u201d.",

The crash was the worst in the country\u2019s aviation history and on Thursday the Ardern said Erebus remained an unparalleled tragedy in Kiwi minds.\n\u201cIn 1979 so much was lost; and the ramifications were immense. And time hasn\u2019t necessarily diminished any of that,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThat loss, in and of itself, was huge. It sent ripples across the country, and trauma that those who weren\u2019t directly affected would probably struggle to fathom.\u201d\n\u201cBut that loss and grief was compounded. It was undeniably worsened by the events that followed,\u201d she said, referring to the subsequent investigation.\nYears of inconclusive and murky inquiries led to accusations from grieving families that Air New Zealand was attempting a cover-up by blaming pilot error \u2013 a theory a 1981 royal commission of inquiry debunked, saying the crash was down to a whiteout and the plane\u2019s navigational route being changed without the pilots being informed.\nAviation experts say improved technology, such as better satellite equipment and weather data means a similar disaster would not occur today.\nThe crash remains New Zealand\u2019s worst peacetime disaster, and because of the country\u2019s size \u2013 just 3 million at the time \u2013 a large portion of the population was affected, with current transport minister Phil Twyford describing it as an event \u201cthat changed our nation\u201d forever.\nAt this moment on this day 40 years ago Air New Zealand Flight TE901 crashed into Mt Erebus killing all 257 passengers and crew \u2014 Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s worst civil disaster in history. Ka maumahara. We remember. #MtErebus40 #OTD #history pic.twitter.com/qxyTbJRl9N\nThe head of the royal inquiry at the time, judge Peter Mahon, described the airline\u2019s participation in the inquiry as \u201can orchestrated litany of lies\u201d leaving victims\u2019 families not only grieving, but angry.\nArdern apologised wholeheartedly on behalf of the airline on Thursday, which was then wholly state-owned.\n\u201cAfter 40 years, on behalf of today\u2019s government, the time has come to apologise for the actions of an airline then in full state ownership; which ultimately caused the loss of the aircraft and the loss of those you loved,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThis apology is whole-hearted and wide-reaching. We will never know your grief, but I know the time has come to say I am sorry.\u201d\nThe Air New Zealand chair, Dame Therese Walsh, also offered her apologies to the families, a few hundred of whom had gathered at the Auckland memorial event.\n\u201cI apologise on behalf of an airline which 40 years ago failed in its duty of care to its passengers and staff,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAnd I apologise again on behalf of the airline for the way in which the families of those lost on Mount Erebus were treated in the aftermath of the accident. Better care should have been taken of you.\u201d\nForty years on there remains no memorial to the Erebus disaster, and plans to erect one in the Auckland suburb of Parnell face strident opposition, with some saying it would be too \u201csad\u201d for local residents.",

        "content": "Mohammed El Halabi was jailed in 2016 over alleged funding of Hamas but not convicted \nA lawyer representing a Palestinian aid worker alleged to have diverted tens of millions of pounds to Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out the secretive trial for three years despite a lack of evidence.\nMaher Hanna said the state should dismiss the case against his client, Mohammed El Halabi, but is unwilling to back down after it made the claims in 2016.\nAfter 126 court sessions, the trial against the former Gaza director of the Christian charity World Vision continues with no clear end. \u201cThe justice system in Israel, since Israel was created, has never seen something like that,\u201d said Hanna. \u201cIt\u2019s very unique.\u201d\nFrom the beginning, the case has been mired in controversy and confusing accusations. Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security service said Halabi transferred more than $7m (\u00a35.4m) a year to the Palestinian militant group that rules the enclave. World Vision retorted that its entire operating budget in Gaza \u2013 regularly audited \u2013 was far less than that amount.\nSince then, internal World Vision investigations and an inquiry by the Australian government, which had donated funds, also found no evidence money had been misused.\nDuring hearings, all held under tight security, Hanna said he had been unable to properly cross-examine witnesses from the security services, as they were often put behind a physical wall to hide their identity.\nHe said he had also been prevented from taking home many records of the sessions, and that critical evidence was also often denied to him, as much of it was confidential.\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unprecedented. There was no procedure like that in the history of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unfair, extremely unbalanced, extremely untruthful.\u201d\nHanna has been attempting to bring witnesses from Gaza, but has been warned that as some are linked to the case, they would be arrested as soon as they left Gaza. In October, he asked the court for them to appear via video conference, but has not heard back.\nWhen Israel first detained Halabi, it held him for 50 days without access to his lawyer, then claimed he had admitted to being a Hamas member with military training and to diverting the money.\nHalabi, however, has claimed his innocence and has been said to have rejected a plea deal offered to him in exchange for admitting to some charges.\n\u201cThey want to convince him to admit to something he did not do. Even silly charges, any charges,\u201d said his father, Khalil Halabi, who also spent his career in the humanitarian sector and worked for the UN Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, including as its education director in Gaza. \u201cHis case embarrasses the government; they need anything from him.\u201d\nHe claimed his son had been beaten in jail and had lost 40% of his hearing. Israeli officials did not offer any specific response to the allegations.\nKhalil Halabi argues his son is ideologically opposed to Hamas, and made efforts to make sure the group was unable to interfere in his aid work, something World Vision has also said.\nThe 42-year-old father of five remains in prison. More than 4,700 Palestinian security detainees and political prisoners are held by Israel, some of them under administrative detention, which allows authorities to detain people without charge or trial.\nThe Israeli foreign ministry repeated in a statement that Halabi had illegally misappropriated funds from World Vision and redirected them to Hamas.\n\u201cAll of the accusations against Mr El-Halabi are well-founded in evidential material and we reject any claims to the contrary,\u201d it said, without specifying. \u201cFor that reason, and because of the security risk he poses, the court has ruled that he should be remanded until the end of the proceedings.\u201d\nThe justice ministry said that dozens of witnesses had testified and the case would take time. \u201cAs to the allegation of concealing the identity of some of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, these are Shin Bet witnesses whose identities are protected by law,\u201d a spokesperson said in a email. They said some evidence was also classified to the public but shared with the defendant and his lawyer.\nIsrael, along with Egypt, has maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza for a decade. It says the measure is for its own security and to pressure Hamas, although the UN slams it a collective punishment for the 2 million people trapped there.\nFor Hanna, his client\u2019s case is another tool to enforce the blockade. After Halabi was arrested in 2016, World Vision suspended operations and later cancelled the contracts of 120 Palestinian employees in Gaza. As one of the largest non-governmental groups working in Gaza, its aid had benefited nearly 40,000 children. Meanwhile, the Australian government froze its donations pending the results of Halabi\u2019s trial.\n\u201cThey wanted to stop the humanitarian work in Gaza,\u201d said Hanna. \u201cAnd to be honest, they succeeded.\u201d",

The temperature is perishing. It squats on a tree stump surrounded by bent nettles and an acre or so of hammered holes that are the hoof prints of an enormous Highland bull and two half-sized versions of himself. Any ambitions his sons may have of testing themselves against this great creature are dashed by the bull\u2019s crushing gaze.\nThe weather\u2019s indifference does the same for birds. A single pied wagtail flirts between the bulls as a band of jackdaws clatters into an old ash tree, the bright-eyed insurgents vanishing into holes in its trunk. Down the lane, there are blackbirds mixed up with redwings that may have travelled together from Scandinavia; how do these northern birds get on with the stay-at-homes?\nWatchful robins venture from hedges to tzeep an alert, somewhere between resignation and hope, like bored security guards. A coven of long-tailed tits flick around trees shaken loose of leaves to offer a draughty architecture of dark, wet boughs to them and the blue tits, nuthatches and other secretive birds; now exposed, their scuttling is like watching shoplifters on CCTV. Mutations of fieldfare roam the soggy wastes of ploughed earth and drowned worms.\nA farmer scatters seed from a quad bike over a grey clay quagmire, a show of initiative that comes from a history haunted by famine that feels, on a day such as this, not far behind the hedge. In a scrubby slum of elm and hazel is a tumble of mossy stones \u2013 all that\u2019s left of a lost story of starvation and ruin.\nToday is a leaf breaking loose from the sighing tree to drift and fall alone.

        "content": "Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has had on growth, prosperity and trade\nThe pound stabilised this month near $1.30 after a recovery in October from the summer woes that pushed sterling down below $1.20 and almost to parity against the euro. To the relief of holidaymakers going to the continent, the pound now stands at \u20ac1.18. The recovery was connected with the slowly evaporating threat of leaving the EU without a deal before the 31 October deadline. Support for sterling also came from poor economic figures from the eurozone, which indicated the currency bloc was entering a period of stagnation. A slowdown in the US also helped the pound\u2019s rebound. This month currency traders have remained on guard against Brexit developments, but with the election in full swing, they must wait until its conclusion before the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU becomes a little clearer.\nShares in London hit a 12-month peak in July, before entering a jittery period that continued last month. Concerns over Britain\u2019s future trading arrangements was the main cause, but figures showing the UK economy slowing down also dragged on share values. The index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies dropped as low as 7,200 over the last month and only rarely pushed above 7,400 to fall well short of July\u2019s 7,700 high point. Stock markets across Europe and the US have proved to be much more buoyant, shrugging off the gloom to register strong gains. The S&P 500 in New York has risen almost 7% since August. France is best performing major economy in Europe this year and since August has seen its stock market, the CAC 40, rise by more than 10%. Even the struggling German stock market, the Dax, ahead by 13% rise over the same period.\nInflation drops back after heavy discounting\nInflation dropped to 1.5% in October after a slide in fuel and energy prices. Heavy discounting at furniture stores also played a part in average prices rising more slowly along with price cuts across the recreation and culture sectors, according to the Office for National Statistics. Core inflation, which strips out volatile fuel costs, stayed at 1.7%, only marginally below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. Bank of England officials, who meet eight times a year to set interest rates, could cut the cost of borrowing in the new year if the decline continues, but few City analysts believe a decision is imminent. The higher level of core inflation was the result of increases in clothing and footwear that pulled down inflation from its recent peak of 3.1% in 2017. Most forecasters predict inflation will stay steady for the next few months, but could rise next year after a Brexit deal likely to send the value of the pound down and the cost of imports up.\nBritain\u2019s trade position improved in September after a 5.2% rise in exports that narrowed the trade gap, but not by as much as City economists had hoped. Much of the increase came from the services sector after increases in the export of business services, intellectual property, financial services and travel consultancy work. A \u00a34.3bn increase in goods exports to \u00a389.7bn was driven largely by machinery and transport equipment and chemicals. But the ONS said it was concerned about its own data and how it showed a surge in exports when other indicators pointed in the opposite direction. The ONS also highlighted how the annual trend had worsened. Over the last 12 months, the total trade deficit widened by almost \u00a319bn to \u00a351.6bn. Poorer exports would also fit with the trends in global trade, which has declined since it became clear that the US president, Donald Trump, was serious about launching a full-blown economic war with China. The OECD, the Paris-based club for the wealthiest 36 nations, said earlier this month that global growth was likely to slow to 2.9% this year before stabilising in 2020 and rising back to 3% in 2021.\nA long slide into recession seemed inevitable after figures from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index showed all areas of Britain\u2019s private sector entering a period of contraction. A flash publication of the index covering about 85% of business activity in manufacturing and the services industry showed that in November, UK companies had the sharpest drop in activity since the EU referendum. Most businesses blamed the situation on faltering confidence among both domestic and overseas customers, who are worn out by continuing political indecision. Not since July 2016 and the weeks after the EU referendum have businesses cut back on new orders and production to such an extent. Analysts said the onset of a general election added to Brexit-related uncertainty and helped to erode business confidence.\nEmployment in the UK fell at its fastest rate in four years in the three months to September and pay growth slid backwards, leading to speculation that Brexit uncertainty was taking its toll on the jobs market. The ONS said employment had fallen by 58,000 during the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 the biggest fall since May 2015. A 93,000 drop in female employment appeared to indicate the trouble faced by high street stores, which employ large numbers of women and have closed at an alarming rate over the last year. The number of men in employment increased by 35,000. Meanwhile, Brexit uncertainty was also evident in the supply of labour, with non-EU nationals accounting for almost all the net growth in migrant employment over the past year. Pay growth fell to 3.6% from 4% in July.\nA rash of price cutting in October on the high street and by online retailers failed to cheer consumers who surprised City analysts with a 0.1% drop purchases. City analysts had expected heavy discounting by retailers to drive up sales. Instead the October figure for retail volumes represented the weakest monthly figure since April last year. Some analysts speculated that shoppers were reluctant to spend before the proposed 31 October Brexit deadline. Others believed the prospect discount shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday later this month, and Christmas had deterred shoppers from spending vital cash in October. There was also speculation that recent declines in employment and wages growth had deterred consumers from spending on big-ticket items such as furniture and cars. Sales fell in all main retail sectors apart from food stores. Once petrol and diesel sales were stripped out the drop was even more severe at 0.3%. Department stores fared a little better than over the previous year, but the rise in sales was modest compared with the battering these large outlets have faced as shoppers desert the high street in favour.\nExtra government spending since last year on Brexit preparations, the health service and a welter of new posts in Whitehall has dented the public purse and pushed ministers\u2019 deficit reduction plans off course. Figures covering last month showed that government borrowing rose to its highest October level in five years as the shortfall hit \u00a311.2bn \u2013 up \u00a32.3bn on a year earlier. The ONS said borrowing in the first seven months of the 2019-20 financial year was \u00a346.3bn, an increase of \u00a34.3bn on the same period in 2018-19. Not only was spending up, but tax receipts were almost flat at just 0.4% higher from the same month last year, with the weakness spread across VAT and taxes on income and companies. City analysts said the annual shortfall was only going to get larger once the next government has begun to include its election promises in the calculation. Before the election, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had already announced the budget deficit in 2020-21 would be lifted appreciably by a \u00a313.8bn increase to public spending (4.1% in real terms and the fastest increase in 15 years).\nHouse prices have remained steady in most parts of the country over the last year, despite Brexit uncertainty. But while the asking price of a home has moved sideways in many areas, the number of properties coming on to the market has fallen sharply. Rightmove reported that new listings dropped by nearly 15% this month, in what was the largest year-on-year slump in any month since August 2009. Across Britain, the average asking price is \u00a3302,808. The recent worries over Brexit also hit the average price tag, which fell by \u00a33,900 in November \u2013 the equivalent of a 1% decline \u2013 on the previous month. Agents said there was an element of \u201cwait and see\u201d among would-be buyers, partly in response to the looming Christmas break, but also the prospect of a new government under Boris Johnson cutting level of stamp duty for first time buyers.\nThe monthly snapshot of economic growth made grim ready in September. The ONS said GDP declined by 0.1% after a 0.2% fall in August. However, a bumper July kept the three-month figure to September in positive territory at plus 0.3%, helping to offset a 0.2% fall in the three months to the end of June and give a six-month growth rate of 0.1%. The manufacturing and construction sectors were the main areas of weakness as Brexit uncertainty pushed firms to cut back production and an increasing number to go bankrupt. Construction firms topped the table of corporate insolvencies, but manufacturers were not far behind. The services sector, which accounts for three quarters of economic activity, kept the economy afloat, though the main boost came from the higher wages they paid to workers rather than higher order books.",

It was a revelation. I became completely hooked, and watched as much of David Lynch\u2019s work as I could.\nI was studying photography and fell into portrait work almost by accident. I saw the comedian Bill Hicks on TV and he blew me away like Twin Peaks had. I spotted he was performing in Manchester and I knew I had to go \u2013 I was like an autograph hunter but using my camera instead of a pen. I stood backstage and introduced myself and asked if I could photograph him. He said yes, and I spent 45 minutes with him in his dressing room. Coming away with something I\u2019d created gave me a massive buzz.\nI showed my Hicks photo to the manager at the local Waterstones and asked if I could have five minutes with people at book signings to take portraits. I photographed everyone from Joseph Heller to Vic & Bob \u2013 and also directors such as Terence Davies and Peter Greenaway at the local art cinema. I built up a portfolio through blagging, basically. I finished university in 1994 with a wishlist of people I wanted to photograph and Lynch was top.\nI found the address of his production company in Los Angeles and wrote to him. I didn\u2019t hear back. A few years later he launched his own website and I\u2019d send him emails that way, about once a year, asking to shoot him when he was next in the UK. Eventually, around 2006, I got an email from his assistant saying he\u2019d seen my work and he would be happy to meet me.\nA year later he was in London and needed some new headshots. I was offered 30 minutes with him at the Sanderson Hotel. In the lobby they have all this weird Philippe Starck furniture \u2013 a sofa shaped like a pair of lips \u2013 and in the billiard room there was a chair with antlers against red curtains. I planned with military precision how I would photograph him in all those spots. However, when I arrived I was told I could no longer use the lobby, and that he was running behind schedule and I could have just five minutes with him in his hotel room. I was panicking on the way up there.\nIt was a tiny room and a TV crew were setting up to do an interview \u2013 there was nowhere to shoot so I suggested the balcony. It was getting dark, there were plant pots everywhere. It wasn\u2019t ideal at all. He was really friendly though, and apologised for us having less time than promised.\nI have a trick that I use on people when I know my time is limited: I try and find something that we have in common that is nothing to do with work. I knew Lynch liked American Spirit cigarettes \u2013 organic tobacco. They were difficult to get hold of in the UK but I had found some for him and he was really chuffed. I remember putting the camera up to my eye and looking through the lens and thinking: \u201cAfter all this time, I\u2019m finally here.\u201d I was really nervous beforehand, I knew I had one shot at it and I couldn\u2019t fuck it up.\nTelling him what to do was quite something for a fanboy but the shoot went great. We wrapped up and he went back inside but then I realised I didn\u2019t have a picture of him smoking, and that\u2019s very much part of his character. So we started packing away really slowly, waiting for the TV interview to wind up, and as soon as it did I asked if we could do one more.\nHe came back out to the balcony and picked a half-smoked cigarette out of the plant pot, lit it up, and then: click, click, click. This is my favourite shot because of who it is, the relationship I have to his work and the years of effort that went into making it happen. It was quite a moment.\nBorn: Sheffield, 1966.\nTraining: Manchester University.\nInfluences: Arnold Newman, David Bailey, Irving Penn, Rankin, Kevin Westenberg.\nHigh point: \u201cOvercoming shyness to ask Bill Hicks if I could photograph him. If that had gone any other way I might not have become a portrait photographer.\u201d\nLow point: \u201cThe American Film Institute asked to use one of my Lynch photos for their 50th anniversary celebrations, but it wasn\u2019t used. I sulked like a dumped teenager.\u201d\nTop tip: \u201cTenacity \u2013 and treat people as you wish to be treated.\u201d",

        "content": "Lawyers say energy treaty among those that could greatly increase costs of Labour pledge\nThe Labour party\u2019s plans to take large parts of the energy industry back under public control is on a collision course with international treaties that guard Europe-owned companies against government takeovers.\nThe rules mean a Labour administration could face rising costs or a legal battle in European tribunals over plans to pay a discount to nationalise energy networks and the big six energy suppliers.\nThe party set out plans in May to renationalise energy networks at below market prices by taking into account the \u201casset stripping and profiteering\u201d since privatisation in the 1980s. The party has also said it would fund the multibillion plans by offering energy company investors Treasury-backed bonds.\nThe plans are part of a wide-ranging policy drive to end \u201crip off\u201d costs and poor customer service by nationalising water, energy, rail and BT\u2019s broadband network.\nBut City lawyers have warned that a web of international treaties could force the cost of Labour\u2019s nationalisation pledges far higher than expected.\nThe law firm Clifford Chance has said the energy charter treaty (ECT) would force the party to offer compensation at a \u201cfair market value\u201d, and would rule out the option of paying shareholders for their assets in government-backed bonds.\nThe ECT would apply to a third of the UK\u2019s energy network companies. These include Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain\u2019s Iberdrola, which runs two electricity networks in the UK and Northern Ireland\u2019s energy networks, which are owned by the Irish company ESB Networks.\nThe treaty would also apply to four of the big six energy suppliers, including Scottish Power, the French-owned EDF Energy, and E.ON UK and Npower, which are both owned by the German utility company E.On SE.\nBritish companies that are not covered by the ECT have already set up offshore holdings to take advantage of similar bilateral agreements with tax havens such as Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Singapore.\nSSE, which owns two energy networks and is the UK\u2019s second largest energy supplier, told the Sunday Times that it had moved the assets into a new Swiss holding company. In the same report National Grid said it had shifted its gas and electricity transmission arm into subsidiaries based in Luxembourg and Hong Kong.\nUK Power Networks is also understood to be protected by a bilateral treaty because it has been owned since 2010 by CKI, an investor based in Hong Kong.\nOne City source said companies representing half the total value of the water industry, which is first in line for nationalisation under a Labour government, have also followed suit. Anglian Water was reportedly investigating an offshore holding company last December, and Yorkshire Water and Severn Trent are considering a similar move.\nThis leaves only a handful of UK companies \u2013 including British Gas \u2013 which are thought to be facing the general election without cover from a treaty that would help them secure a higher price in the event of a government takeover.\nAccording to Clifford Chance, these companies can \u201ctake a degree of comfort from the political quandary the government would find itself in if it is ordered by an international tribunal to pay increased compensation to foreign investors.\u201d\nThe firm added: \u201cThe final result may be that there is little practical choice but to offer a fair value to all.\u201d\nA spokesman for Labour said the party has consulted \u201cwith a number of lawyers\u201d and is confident that the party will \u201cdeliver the changes that the electorate wants\u201d.\n\u201cOur whole economy will benefit from affordable and reliable rail, mail, energy, water and broadband. In the meantime, those who have done very nicely out of privatisation \u2013 and those with something to gain from talking up the legal difficulties \u2013 will no doubt continue to exaggerate the legal complications,\u201d the spokesman added.\n This article was amended on 28 November 2019. An earlier version referred to the energy charter treaty as an EU law when it meant to refer it as an international treaty, which applies to most EU countries. This article has also been amended to say that any legal action would take place in tribunals, not the European courts.",

The Scottish government has agreed to this but in England and Wales the proposals have stalled.\nLaura Foster, the MCS\u2019s head of clean seas, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to ensure we\u2019re not taking our foot off the pedal to push the UK\u2019s governments to adopt all-inclusive DRS at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\u201cThe Scottish government\u2019s commitment to an all-inclusive DRS is a fantastic step in the right direction, but it must be designed to include all drinks containers and must not exclude glass. Delaying the implementation of DRS by a year would result in 50m additional empty containers littering our beaches, [so] it\u2019s imperative that the 2021 implementation date is adhered to.\u201d\nNow in its 26th consecutive year, the Great British Beach Clean in September was a UK-wide long weekend of coastal cleaning from Land\u2019s End to the Shetland Islands. More than 10,800 volunteers carried out a total of 437 beach cleans and litter surveys and removed 10,833kg (nearly 11 tonnes) of litter.\nAn average of 558 litter items were found for every 100 metres of beach surveyed. Plastic remained by far the most common form of litter (143 pieces per 100 metres), followed by cigarette butts (42) and glass items (33). There were six drinks cans per 100 metres.\nLizzie Prior, the MCS\u2019s Beachwatch officer, said: \u201cGreat British Beach Clean data has been instrumental in pushing for policies and initiatives which have made a real change to the marine environment, including the 5p carrier bag charge.\u201d",

        "content": "Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Adams teach us a lot but applying their lessons to our challenges seems a thankless task\nHistory is misused. Perhaps worse, history is too often ignored. To address both problems, Joseph Ellis hopes to restore dialogue in national life, using the Founders as touchstones rather than infallible guides.\nEllis\u2019s career has focused on writing about the Founders and he stands firmly on the side of history: \u201cThe more history you learn, the larger the memory bank you can draw on when life takes a turn for which you are otherwise unprepared.\u201d\nIndeed. Since 2016, US national life has certainly taken a turn for which we were otherwise unprepared, though its roots go back decades, even in some respects, such as race, beyond the founding itself.\nEllis starts with Jefferson and race, writing that the Virginian, who began his career with a failed attempt to make emancipation easier, was \u201cthoroughly embedded in the twin American dilemmas of slavery and racism \u2026 our most eloquent \u2018apostle of freedom\u2019 is also our most dedicated racist, and \u2026 in his mind, those two convictions were inseparable\u201d. Jefferson could simply not imagine a biracial America, despite his longtime romance with Sally Hemings, his slave, though he freed her children.\nFollowing the \u201cSecond Reconstruction\u201d of the 1960s, \u201c[t]he new narrative featured the upside of the Jeffersonian legacy while dismissing the downside as a premodern vestige of values that were now, at last, gone with the proverbial wind. This last assumption has proven woefully naive, most especially the belief that ending segregation was synonymous with ending racism.\u201d\nEllis wants to add another panel to the Jefferson Memorial, featuring Jefferson\u2019s views on race and slavery, as a counterweight and a reminder of the continuing tensions over race in American society.\nEllis\u2019s chapter on John Adams is the most successful, discussing Adams\u2019s prediction that the American aristocracy would be commercial in nature, as in our new gilded age, with money awash in politics. In Ellis\u2019s view, Adams asks us to broaden our minds: \u201cThink about the word \u2018republic\u2019, which comes from the Latin meaning \u2018public things\u2019. Do we still believe, as he did, that there is a \u2018public interest\u2019 beyond the reach of majorities of the moment? Are we a society composed of winners and losers, givers and takers, or is there some larger status we share as citizens?\u201d\nThe chapters on Madison and modern jurisprudence form a stout defense of the \u201cliving constitution\u201d (which again traces its origins to Jefferson) and sharp criticism of Antonin Scalia and \u201coriginalism\u201d, focusing on the former supreme court justice\u2019s (re)interpretation of the second amendment and gun rights in contrast to what the Framers probably understood.\nIn foreign policy, Ellis helpfully reinterprets George Washington\u2019s policies on Native Americans and the British/French conflicts of the 1770s to offer a more nuanced view of Washington\u2019s presumed support for isolationism. Ellis sees this instead as the start of the realist tradition in American foreign policy in contrast to Jefferson\u2019s idealistic support for the French Revolution. Ellis stands for realism, whether in opposing Jacobins or not invading Iraq.\nEllis writes that \u201cmy hope is that the founding era can become a safe place to gather together, not so much as to find answers to those questions as to argue about them \u2026 their greatest legacy is the recognition that the argument itself is the answer.\u201d Yet throughout his own views are crystal clear: he plumps for the liberal tradition in contrast not only to Trumpism but to most of what passes for modern conservatism, starting with Ronald Reagan.\nTo his credit, Ellis admits that \u201cobjectivity, in the sense that mathematicians or physicians use the term, is not a realistic goal for historians\u201d. The scientific reference is surely a sly echoing of Jefferson\u2019s Virginia Statute on Religious Freedom, which states that \u201cour civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry\u201d. But if the goal is to encourage national dialogue not only with the past but with ourselves, that\u2019s easier if the author\u2019s thumb isn\u2019t quite so heavy on the scale.\nIn this sense, Ellis is not ambitious enough. Does he really believe Chief Justice John Roberts wants to repeal the school desegregation case Brown v Board of Education? The \u201cNow\u201d sections are, regrettably, sloppier than those on the Founders. Ellis succeeds more in recovering lesser-known history, such as the near abolition of slavery in the territories in 1784 and Washington\u2019s attempts at humane policies towards Native Americans.\nDespite their personal foibles, the Founders remain as reference points for modern life, not least in exposing contradictions within the American polity and psyche. At some level, this is not new. Walt Whitman wrote \u201cI contain multitudes\u201d. On the academic front, Michael Kammen covered the inherent dissonances of American society in People of Paradox, in 1972.\nEllis has breathed the air of the Founders for so long that he stumbles somewhat on modern politics. But his book is necessary, and part of the tragedy is that those who need it most are less likely to read it, or to learn from it if they do.",

Berlin, New York and Los Angeles also rank high in the 2019 list \u2013 with Bangkok in the top 10 for the first time.\nHome to 152 vegan restaurants citywide \u2013 including eateries serving plant-based takes on fried chicken, sushi and pizza \u2013 London\u2019s meat-free scene has gone mainstream in recent years. In 2017 it was the first city on the HappyCow list to reach 100 completely vegan restaurants \u2013 perhaps not surprising for a city with its own vegan hair salon.\nThe HappyCow list ranks cities according to three factors: the number of vegan restaurants in a five-mile radius within the most vegan-restaurant-dense area in each city (London has 125); the number of restaurants with vegan, vegetarian or veggie menu options in the same five-mile radius; and HappyCow\u2019s impression of the overall vegan-friendliness of each city.\n\u201cVeganism continues to become a mainstream lifestyle in London and this city takes veganism to a new level,\u201d said Ken Spector, co-author of the HappyCow list.\nSome of HappyCow\u2019s favourites include PickyWops, Purezza and Young Vegans Pizza Shop (formerly Death By Pizza) \u2013 all examples of the city\u2019s flourishing vegan pizza scene. It also references the world\u2019s first vegan chicken shop, The Temple of Seitan, Japanese food at Itadakizen, and Caribbean-inspired cuisine at Rogue Vegan.\nAs well as its restaurants, HappyCow also recommends London for its abundance of vegan-friendly stalls, bakeries, cafes and smoothie bars \u2013 and the UK\u2019s first plant-based cheese shop, La Fauxmagerie. Non-food favourites include shops such as clothing brand The Third Estate and hair salon The Rabbit Hole Vegan Hair Parlour.\nAccording to The Vegan Society, the number of vegans in the UK quadrupled between 2014 and 2019 to 600,000. At the current growth rate, it predicts vegans and vegetarians will make up a quarter of the population by 2025, and flexitarians just under half.\n\u201cOf all our 20 years, this past year has seen the most dramatic growth in vegan interest,\u201d said Eric Brent, CEO and founder of HappyCow.\n This article was amended on 29 November 2019.

Today the climate crisis is high on the agenda \u2013 Labour will unveil its environment policies, there is the leaders\u2019 TV climate debate tonight, and all of this comes after a warning from scientists that the world may already have crossed a series of tipping points meaning \u201cwe are in a state of planetary emergency\u201d. Make sure to keep on top of politics at our live blog.\nJeremy Corbyn will be in Southampton where he will set out the party\u2019s environment policies, including the planting of 2bn trees by 2040. Labour also plans to create 10 new national parks as part of a rewilding policy to tackle the climate emergency. The proposals also include an investment of \u00a31.2bn to restore habitats such as woodlands and peat bogs in England, and extra funding for national park authorities.\nTonight the leaders of most parties \u2013 as far as we know, Boris Johnson has not accepted the invitation \u2013 will participate in a Channel 4 debate on climate issues. At this stage Nigel Farage also appears to be a non-starter.\nOne plank of Labour\u2019s energy policy is under fire today, as lawyers have warned that the party\u2019s plans to take large parts of the energy industry back under public control puts it on a collision course with EU laws that guard Europe-owned companies against government takeovers.\nThere may be further fallout from Corbyn\u2019s deadliest line of attack in this election campaign: his claims that leaked documents show Johnson wants to sell off the NHS in a trade deal with the US. The official papers reveal US and UK officials have repeatedly discussed dismantling protections that keep NHS drug prices down as part of their negotiations about a post-Brexit trade deal. Dennis Campbell and Jamie Grierson have unpacked what the dossier says and what it means. Heather Stewart writes that \u201cCorbyn had one central aim as he brandished the 451-page \u2018secret\u2019 NHS document at a hastily-arranged press conference on Wednesday: to drag the general election debate safely back into Labour\u2019s comfort zone\u201d after the antisemitism accusations\u201d.\nA new poll for the Times points to a thumping Conservative victory. While the Guardian is treating all polls with suspicion, read why here, the MRP poll from YouGov came closest to calling the unexpected result of the 2017 general election.\nThe poll predicts the Conservatives will win 359 seats (42 gains), leaving Johnson with a majority of 68. Labour, meanwhile, would fall back to 211 seats \u2013 a result that would be in line with the disaster of 1983.

        "content": "Allen wants to set up a small company working from home, and would like some advice\nI\u2019m looking to set up a small business working from home, and would like some advice on back up and security measures. I have an Office 365 account so my main directory for saving documents will be OneDrive. I was looking to back up on a Synology NAS drive, perhaps to two separate hard drives as a precaution. Also, I currently just use Windows\u2019 built-in security, but wondered whether I should look for something else.\nInitially, it would just be me, but if things go well then I may have another two or three people helping. I\u2019m assuming I can just scale up any security measures as the need arises. Allen\nTechnology manufacturers cater to two very large markets with different needs: home users and businesses. You\u2019re about to enter the SoHo (small office, home office) market where home technologies dominate because most single traders don\u2019t need proper business systems with all the extra costs and complications involved.\nSome complications are unavoidable. These include, as you know, backup and security, plus things like coping with data protection requirements. But as you will be a startup business working from home, I suggest using home technologies as far as possible. You can move to a business-oriented approach when you need to expand. When that time comes, you will have a much better idea of what you actually need.\nHowever, note that the Home and Personal versions of Office 365 are not licensed for commercial use, even though many people don\u2019t know about or ignore this restriction. If you\u2019re on a Home version, consider switching to one of the small business versions (up to 300 users), if only for the 24/7 support.\nOffice 365 Business Essentials is the cheapest because it doesn\u2019t include the desktop Microsoft Office programs, which Office 365 Business does. In the long run, Office 365 Business Premium is the best option because it includes business-class email with your own domain name via Microsoft Exchange. It also includes a calendar and booking feature, SharePoint and Teams collaboration software (Teams is Microsoft\u2019s rival to Slack), invoicing, and a lightweight CRM (customer relationship management) program.\nThere are many things to consider when choosing anti-malware software. How good is it at protecting your PC? Does it create other problems by making your PC slower or by blocking things unnecessarily? (File blocking and \u201cfalse positives\u201d can be really annoying.) How valuable are the things you need to protect? What are the risks? How much does it cost?\nMicrosoft Defender (formerly Windows Defender) is good enough for most home users and many business users. I use it myself. It doesn\u2019t offer the maximum protection, but it rarely causes any problems, and it\u2019s free.\nSome people should consider paying for extra protection. For example, they may have data that is particularly valuable, because they work for a financial institution or whatever. They may be potential targets because they work for a non-governmental organisation or, for example, the Dalai Lama. They may be at greater risk because they surf hacking sites or the dark web, or because a lack of understanding leads them to do stupid things. People who have the best AV software can still get their PCs infected by attacks based on scam emails and/or fake websites and \u201csocial engineering\u201d. You can email people password-protected viruses and persuade some of them to decrypt and run the files.\nPaid-for anti-virus suites try to improve on or offer utilities that Windows lacks. These can include password managers, real-time protection based on scanning background processes, anti-phishing and anti-ransomware features, controlling access to USB ports and external drives, botnet protection and network monitoring. Some of these are useful to small businesses where PCs are used by staff who are not computer experts. Kaspersky\u2019s promotional blog post, The 10 most important features of Kaspersky Small Office Security, will give you an overview.\nThere are plenty of reviews of anti-virus products for small business on sites such as Windows Report, Digital Trends and Tech Radar. The consensus is that Bitdefender for Business is probably your best bet, and good value. Kaspersky Small Office Security for Business and the Avast Endpoint Protection Suite Plus are also worth a serious look. You can usually get a free trial period so have a quick look at the suites you fancy, preferably on a spare PC.\nOddly enough, having a good, trusted backup is also a good form of anti-virus protection. Ransomware doesn\u2019t work on people who know all their data is safely stored offline.\nNote that pretty much every effective computer security system, including Microsoft\u2019s, now uses the cloud to store, update and check virus signatures, and Cloud AI to analyse suspicious processes. Some things \u2013 digital fingerprints or even whole files \u2013 may be uploaded for extra checking. I don\u2019t regard this as a threat to privacy and, frankly, I think it\u2019s stupid to block it.\nCloud systems lighten the load on the local PC, and as Webroot showed roughly a decade ago, provide better protection. Companies with \u201choneypot\u201d PCs and continuous updates from millions of users can spot and deal with new and emerging threats long before they reach your PC. As a result, a growing number of companies are now marketing Cloud Antivirus or Security Cloud software. This is clearly where the AV industry is heading.\nI\u2019ve been writing about backups for decades, and you can get most of the information you need from earlier answers. Two appropriate ones, in this case, are What is the best way to back up data? and Is my data safe in online drives, or should I back it up as well?\nIn brief, you should have backups of all your business data on different media (choose between hard drives, optical discs, SD cards, online and so on) and in different places, in case you are burgled or your house burns down. OneDrive should provide an online/off-site backup of all your business data, but I\u2019d still want some form of backup stored outside your house.\nHowever, at this stage, I would not buy a NAS (network-attached storage) device. You don\u2019t need one. You could justify a NAS if, for example, you wanted to stream media files to half a dozen laptops and smartphones, or your business depended on several people sharing files at once. For your purposes, the extra complexity and cost don\u2019t make sense.\nIn any case, a NAS is not, by itself, a very good backup. You would certainly want to back it up to an external hard drive. Instead, just use one external hard drive to back up your PC, and a second external hard drive to back that up.\nWhat you really need is a business recovery system. If something failed, how long would it take you to get back up and running? How long a delay is acceptable?\nI have a desktop PC with all the files on the hard drive synchronised to an external USB hard drive using FreeFileSync, backed up to a second external hard drive. These files are not compressed or encrypted so they don\u2019t need to be restored. If my desktop\u2019s hard drive fails \u2013 which it has done \u2013 then I can switch to a laptop, plug in one of the external monitors, the keyboard and the external hard drive, and carry on as normal in 10-15 minutes. Of course, I had to spend some time the next day installing a new hard drive and restoring my old system from a different backup \u2013 a big, digital blob \u2013 but I could do that at my leisure. It didn\u2019t affect my work.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy for me because I do almost everything in Microsoft Office, which was already installed on my laptop, all my email is online in Outlook, and I don\u2019t have a lot of data. (My whole work directory of about 10,500 files takes up 3GB.) It might be harder for people with more complicated setups, but should be easier for you if everything is in OneDrive. You might even be able to manage with the online versions of the Microsoft Office programs.\nBusiness recovery is a much broader concept than backups. It involves going through your business processes and working out what you would do if any hardware, software or communications link failed, or if you were hacked, or hit by some type of natural disaster.\nCompanies that don\u2019t have viable business recovery strategies can easily go out of business.\nHave you got a question?

        "content": "Aid worker claims refugees are being denied food to motivate them to leave\nThe UN has been accused of trying to starve out refugees and asylum seekers who are sheltering for safety inside a centre run by the UN refugee agency in the Libyan capital of Tripoli.\nOne group of about 400 people, who came to the Tripoli gathering and departure facility in October from Abu Salim detention centre in the south of the country, have apparently been without food for weeks.\nAmong them are 100 minors, according to a recent assessment by the International Organization for Migration. They are \u201ccurrently starving\u201d apart from some food that other refugees manage to sneak out of another part of the centre, the IOM assessment said. They last received food assistance a \u201ccouple of weeks ago\u201d.\nInternal documents seen by the Guardian show that the UNHCR is also planning to withdraw food from 600 other refugees and migrants in the centre \u2013 who include survivors of bombings, torture, forced labour and other human rights abuses. The majority have already tried to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean, but were returned to Libya by the EU-backed Libyan coastguard.\nIn a document circulated among UN staff on Tuesday, and seen by the Guardian, the agency said it would \u201cphase out\u201d food catering from 31 December. The document said the information should not be made public before mid-December, when 230 more refugees have been evacuated to other countries, in order to prevent disruption. After that, the facility will no longer be used as a transit centre, the document said, until the remaining refugees and migrants \u201cvacate voluntarily\u201d.\nIn the document, the UNHCR said that it would continue to finance cleaning in the centre after the withdrawal of food, partly to \u201cprevent the reputational risk of having deficient/broken toilets and showers\u201d. It also said a healthcare clinic on the site would continue to operate.\nAn aid worker with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cThey are starving the population inside the [facility]. They\u2019re just trying to starve them to motivate them to leave. It\u2019s deliberately withholding aid to put people under pressure.\u201d\nThe group who will be affected by the next food withdrawal include 400 survivors of the 3 July Tajoura detention centre bombing, in which at least 53 refugees and migrants were killed after an airstrike hit the hall in which they were being held. Hundreds of survivors remained on the site of the strike for a week afterwards, staging a hunger strike in protest at the lack of help.\nThey eventually walked dozens of miles to the gathering and departure facility, where they were let in but told their cases for evacuation wouldn\u2019t be evaluated until they agreed to leave the centre.\nOne Tajoura survivor told the Guardian this week that if they are forced to leave and fend for themselves in Tripoli \u201cit will be a very dangerous scenario\u201d. Refugees are frightened of forced recruitment by militias, being caught up in the ongoing civil war, or being kidnapped anew by traffickers. Others who have taken a UNHCR offer of money, in return for living alone in Tripoli, say the payments are not enough and they remain in danger. One Eritrean man recently released from Triq al Sikka detention centre was shot last week by men in police uniforms who, he said, were trying to rob him.\n\u201cStill now they didn\u2019t give food. I think it is [on] purpose?\u201d an Eritrean refugee in the facility messaged the Guardian this week through WhatsApp. \u201cEveryone is suffering and stressed and we have all decided to stay here until they use force, because being returned to a detention centre means again facing trafficking, torture and abuse.\u201d\nThe man said he spent more than a year in Abu Salim detention centre, which was repeatedly caught on the frontlines of Tripoli\u2019s ongoing conflict. \u201c[We have] no option until UNHCR gives us a positive response. Even if they leave we will stay here. We have no option, we will not go anywhere. There are no safe places in Libya at this time.\u201d\nAn 11 November email sent by the Guardian to UNHCR spokespeople, which asked whether denying food to former Abu Salim detainees in the facility was a \u201cdeliberate policy on UNHCR\u2019s part\u201d, went unanswered, as did further requests for comment.\nThe internal UN document suggest that, after the agency stops using the facility as a transit centre, the property could continue to operate as an \u201copen centre\u201d for refugees and migrants previously held in detention centres, though there are other \u201cpossible scenarios\u201d. These include that Libya\u2019s department for combating illegal migration (DCIM) \u201cmoves in and forcibly removes all the migrants/asylum-seekers \u2026 [to] detention centres\u201d, or that it turns the facility into a detention centre run by its own guards.\nThe DCIM, which is under the interior ministry of the UN-backed Tripoli Government of National Accord, ostensibly runs a network of migrant detention centres in Libya, though in reality most are run by militias. A litany of human rights abuses, including rape and sexual abuse, labour exploitation and a denial of medical care have been reported.\nThe UN-run facility opened in December last year to much fanfare. \u201cThe opening of this centre, in very difficult circumstances, has the potential to save lives,\u201d said the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi. \u201cIt offers immediate protection and safety for vulnerable refugees in need of urgent evacuation, and is an alternative to detention for hundreds of refugees currently trapped in Libya.\u201d",

The amount of land required to be cultivated to feed livestock adds to the problem, with its associated fertiliser use and deforestation.\nMany studies have suggested that moving to a diet based largely on plants and containing much less meat than is currently consumed in rich countries will be vital to combatting the climate crisis. It would also be healthier, as consumers in the rich world are eating more meat than is recommended, though poorer people struggle to get enough protein.\nUsing GM technology in plants for human consumption and in animals is banned in Europe. However, the UK could loosen restrictions after Brexit. Any such move would be highly controversial among some farming campaigners, in part because it could open up rifts with the EU over trade.\nRob Percival, the head of policy at the Soil Association, cast doubt on the potential climate benefits. \u201cGM is a distraction \u2013 we already have the solutions to the climate crisis at our fingertips. The focus should be on empowering farmers to adopt more nature-friendly agroecological farming systems and shifting diets to create demand for more sustainable food,\u201d he said.\n\u201cInstead of looking to risky and unproven technologies and chemicals as a sticking plaster, we should be tackling the root causes of these crises, putting farmers in the driving seat of sustainable innovation.\u201d\nGeoff Simm, the director of the global academy of agriculture and food security at the University of Edinburgh, said farmers were feeling \u201cdemonised\u201d by campaigns encouraging people to adopt vegan diets to protect the climate.\nCalculations of the harm done by eating meat are usually based on US production techniques, which are highly intensive and involve grain-feeding. In the UK, by contrast, cows and sheep are more likely to graze outdoors, often using land that would not be viable for crop production, which means their associated emissions are far less.\nIn the UK there is also far more overlap between the beef and dairy industries, with more than half of beef production coming from the dairy herd, which also makes for lower emissions.\nConventional breeding techniques have also played a role in cutting livestock emissions, with the UK now producing more milk from fewer cattle than it did 25 years ago.",

But here\u2019s where they could make the biggest difference\nOne of the many unpredictable factors of the 2019 election is the surge in new voter registration. More than three million people have applied to join the electoral roll since the December polling day was announced, and one-third of them are under the age of 25.\nLarge numbers of these young people are likely to be students registering at their university addresses, including influential first-time voters.\nIn some areas, their impact may only be to increase majorities in existing Labour safe-seats. In others, students heading home for the Christmas holidays may mute any expected effect.\nBut there is still a number of important marginals where university populations may hold the balance of power. Here are ten battles where their votes could be crucial.\nConstituency: North East Fife\nSNP majority: 2\nIf you\u2019re a student in North East Fife, you probably live in the marginal of all marginals. The Liberal Democrats have improved their Scottish polling numbers since the 2017 election and hope to win the seat back for the first time since 2010, but it isn\u2019t clear that young voters will be queuing up to help them do so.\nConstituency: Southampton Itchen\nConservative majority: 31\nSouthampton Itchen sits at the top of Labour\u2019s list of target seats, having missed out on taking it in 2017 by a mere 31 votes. Students at both Southhampton and Solent universities will be essential to the party if it is to win in a constituency where 60% voted to leave the EU.\nConstituency: Stirling\nConservative majority: 148\nThere\u2019s no shortage of ultra-marginals to be found in Scotland; and while the SNP will have its eye on winning back Stirling, the Conservative party has been doing better in Scottish polls than many expected at the start of the campaign. The SNP will need to mobilise all the student votes they can.\nConstituency: Ipswich\nLabour majority: 831\nLabour won Ipswich from the Conservatives\u2019 Benedict Gummer in 2017, defeating him by just 0.03% of the vote. Whether Gummer can win it back this time around could be down to the 5,000+ students at the University of Suffolk.\nConstituency: Glasgow North\nSNP majority of 1,060\nThe SNP will expect to hold on to Glasgow North, but a lot will depend on whether students living in the constituency back the independence party or Labour, which has seen its overall support in Scotland appear to collapse.\nConstituency: Hendon\nConservative majority: 1,072\nMiddlesex University has a student body of almost 20,000, making up a huge chunk of Hendon\u2019s diverse electorate. If they vote in large numbers they could well win the seat for Labour for the first time since 2005. However, a recent poll saw the Conservatives pulling further ahead as previous Labour voters indicated support for the Liberal Democrats.\nConstituency: Lincoln\nLabour majority: 1,538\nLincoln is a leave-voting marginal and will be one of Labour\u2019s many tricky defences on election day when they may see their vote squeezed by both the Brexit party and the Lib Dems. The party\u2019s hopes of holding on to the seat could lie at the feet of Lincoln\u2019s students, who are likely to vote mostly in Labour\u2019s favour.\nConstituency: Putney\nConservative majority: 1,554\nPutney was held by Justine Greening of the Conservatives, but a fallout over Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan saw her lose the whip and subsequently decide not to stand for re-election. It\u2019s a tough seat to call, having voted heavily to remain part of the EU. It could go to the Lib Dems, Labour, or neither. How Roehampton students vote \u2013 and how many \u2013 could be key.\nConstituency: Northampton South\nConservative majority: 1,554\nTaking leave-voting Northampton South could be a long shot for Labour, which hasn\u2019t won there since 2001. But if it has any hope of doing so, the strategy must lie with persuading a large number of the University of Northampton\u2019s 12,000 students to vote Labour.\nConstituency: Wolverhampton South West\nLabour majority: 2,185\nThe Conservatives are taking aim at all of Wolverhampton\u2019s constituencies this election, with a strong pro-Brexit message at the heart of their strategy. But it may not be enough in this particular seat, where a large student population will work in favour of Labour\u2019s Eleanor Smith.\nConstituency: Bristol West\nLabour majority: 37,997\nYou might think that Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire couldn\u2019t be in a safer seat, after defending it in 2017 with a thumping majority of 37,997. But the Green party has been eyeing it up since its strong second place in the 2015 election, and there are signs it may cause an upset. The Liberal Democrats have stood their candidate down, leaving the Greens as the only Remain party on the ticket in a constituency where almost 80% voted to stay in the EU. And in the 2019 European elections, the Greens won the popular vote in Bristol, taking over 35% of all ballots cast. The votes of Bristol\u2019s students could be a crucial factor.\nThis article was amended on 29 November 2019 because the Green\u2019s Carla Denyer is the only Remain party ticket in Bristol West, but she is not the only Remainer candidate standing in the constituency as an earlier version said.",

        "content": "World heritage centre says it is \u2018ready to provide technical assistance\u2019 after bushfires in NSW and Queensland\nThe Unesco world heritage centre has expressed concern about bushfire damage to the Gondwana rainforests of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, and asked the Australian government whether it is affecting their world heritage values.\nIn a statement on its website, the centre said members of the media and civil society had asked about the bushfires affecting the areas inscribed on the world heritage list as the \u201cGondwana rainforests of Australia\u201d. The forests are considered a living link to the vegetation that covered the southern supercontinent Gondwana before it broke up about 180m years ago.\n\u201cThe World Heritage Centre is currently verifying the information with the Australian authorities, in particular regarding the potential impact of the fires on the outstanding universal value of the property,\u201d the statement says.\n\u201cThe centre has been closely following-up on this matter and stands ready to provide any technical assistance at the request of Australian authorities.\u201d\nScientists say the bushfires this spring have been unprecedented, in part because they have destroyed areas that have historically been too wet to burn. The affected area includes parts of the major remaining rainforest areas in south-east Queensland and north-east NSW, which are listed as one world heritage site.\nThe world heritage area includes the largest areas of subtropical rainforest on the planet, some warm temperate rainforest and nearly all the world\u2019s Antarctic beech cool temperate rainforest. It consists of about 40 separate reserves, spread between Newcastle and Brisbane, and surrounded by fire-prone eucalypt forest and farms.\nThe centre says the rainforests are \u201coutstanding examples of major stages of the Earth\u2019s evolutionary history, ongoing geological and biological processes, and exceptional biological diversity\u201d.\nA spokesman for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, confirmed the government had received correspondence from the World Heritage Centre about the current fires and said the Department of Environment and Energy was working with state agencies to prepare a response. \u201cThese agencies are still engaged in firefighting operations and assessment of fire impacts on the world heritage property is ongoing,\u201d he said.\nThe spokesman said all parks and reserves were covered by a reserve fire management strategy to reduce wildfire risk but under extreme conditions the risk could not be eliminated. He said climate change had been identified as a threat to the outstanding universal values of Gondwana rainforests, and commonwealth and Queensland scientists were collaborating to better understand how it would affect the area.\n\u201cThe research will be invaluable in underpinning adaptation measures,\u201d he said.\nDocuments released under freedom of information laws show the Australian world heritage advisory committee warned the then environment minister, Melissa Price, in October 2018 that climate change had significant implications for world heritage properties. It said changes in species distribution and abundance were already being recorded at world heritage sites.\nThe Australian committee said while the people responsible for heritage properties could not address climate change, action must be taken to manage the impact. The federal government was urged to help site managers develop a coordinated adaptation response.\nThe Unesco world heritage committee has also been holding a review into how countries should manage the impact of the climate crisis on heritage sites.The Australian government has been pushing for the issue to be resolved before the committee reassesses the world heritage status of the Great Barrier Reef next year. It previously avoided the reef being listed as world heritage in danger.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s chief executive, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, said authorities charged with overseeing world heritage sites had been sounding the alarm about climate risk to the federal government, but their concerns appeared to have largely fallen on deaf ears.\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe said Unesco\u2019s concerns about the rainforests mirrored the alarm being felt in Australia. \u201cMany of these forests are supposed to be too wet to burn, but local and global inaction on climate change is supercharging the length, intensity and range of bushfire seasons,\u201d she said.\nO\u2019Shanassy called on the government to invest more in improving the health of world heritage sites by tackling invasive species, connecting vegetated areas and halting land clearing. But she said the ultimate solution was to stop burning coal, gas and oil, and destroying forests.\n\u201cAustralia must take stronger domestic action and leverage that into pushing for stronger global action so we do not lose our world heritage sites forever,\u201d she said.",

It is a document about how society should be organised, about how leaders should behave, about how vulnerable people should be treated by society. The Bible is an inherently political document, and religion is a political animal.\n\u201cIf people of faith are going to their churches or mosques or synagogues as though it\u2019s some sort of spiritual jacuzzi, it\u2019s a denial of the very heart of religion. Religion is about morality and it\u2019s about public morality. It\u2019s about how we treat our neighbours but its purpose is also to ask why people are not able to buy food or pay their rent or pay for healthcare. That is a moral question.\u201d\nThe issues of greatest urgency in the US were immigration, the \u201chorrific epidemic of gun violence\u201d, the rise of white nationalism, climate justice and \u201cabsolutely unnecessary\u201d poverty, Latz said.\nOn immigration, he said: \u201cWe as Jews have a special obligation to welcome the stranger into our homes. We know what it\u2019s like to have no home, to have to flee \u2013 we know that story in our bones, it\u2019s in our DNA.\n\u201cThis is quite simple: are the people seeking a better life at our southern border human beings or not? And if they are human beings, they deserve to be treated as such. This issue is black and white as far as I\u2019m concerned. If you\u2019re not for moral, humane, comprehensive immigration reform, you are tacitly supporting ripping babies from their parents\u2019 arms at our border.\u201d\nA network of more than 80 synagogues in the US has offered sanctuary to undocumented migrants.\n\u201cWe have people living in basements and attics,\u201d Latz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s vital and important holy work, and we are called to do it.\u201d\nIn Minnesota, faith organisations lobbied for legislation to prevent schools from expelling or suspending children under 12 for nonviolent offences.\n\u201cIt may not sound much,\u201d Latz said, \u201cbut the vast majority of kids who were suspended were children of colour, and there is a direct correlation between being suspended at the age of 10 and landing in prison. So by changing the policy we are stopping the school-to-prison pipeline.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe next level we\u2019re working on \u2013 which is much harder \u2013 is changing the tax codes in the state, so people who make more contribute more.\u201d\nTax reforms instituted by \u201cour dreadful miscreant of a president\u201d have given \u201chorrific tax breaks to people who are obscenely wealthy already\u201d, Latz said.\nIn the present political climate, he added, \u201cwe are acutely aware of how fragile our structures of democracy are, of how technology can be used to undermine democracy. The lines being drawn in society are so bright.\u201d\nLatz rejected the viewpoint that faith leaders should stay out of politics, saying being political was not the same as being partisan. Political engagement could also re-energise religious institutions, he said.\n\u201cThere are [religious leaders] whose first commandment is \u2018Thou shalt not offend.\u2019 Then they wonder why young people don\u2019t come to shul [synagogue]. Synagogues that are thriving have a very clear engagement with justice issues. I have young people by the hordes coming to my shul because we\u2019re offering serious study, we\u2019re wrestling with deep issues and we\u2019re asking big questions.\n\u201cWhen you go to shul, you should have your heart cracked open, you should be weeping, your hands should be shaking \u2013 and you should walk out energised and ready to get to work. If not, why go? Go watch a movie or get a mani-pedi instead.\u201d\nLatz, 49, who has two children with his husband, said being a gay rabbi was \u201cnot so unusual\u201d these days.\n\u201cMy commitment to justice comes out of being a gay man and a Jew. Feminism taught us that the personal is political. My own experience of facing homophobic discrimination, and having to work hard to marry my husband and protect my family, has shaped for me how vital and important this work is.\u201d\nNevertheless, faith-based political activism could be \u201crisky and problematic\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is not for the faint of heart. You lose 27 times before you win.\u201d\nBut increasing numbers of faith leaders were engaging in the struggle for justice, he said. More than 2,000 rabbis, for example, have joined T\u2019ruah, a network dedicated to advancing human rights in North America, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\u201cMy children and future grandchildren will ask me what I was doing in this moment of great moral crisis,\u201d Latz said. \u201cEvery generation faces a moment of moral conscience and it has to decide what side of history it will fall on. We have one life to live, and we have the power to make the world more whole.\u201d",

He said there were two concerns with the conversation: Morrison had a \u201cvested political interest in the police investigation failing to find any misconduct by his minister\u201d; and \u201cthe personal relationship between commissioner Fuller and prime minister Morrison \u2026 having been neighbours\u201d.\nFuller and Morrison have previously confirmed the two were neighbours in Sydney, and the prime minister described the commissioner in 2018 as a \u201cgood bloke\u201d. But after controversy about the call from the prime minister erupted, Fuller stepped back on Wednesday from the idea the two men had a personal relationship.\n Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nIn Canberra, Labor continued its pursuit of Taylor and of Morrison in the final question time of the week, and the prime minister attempted to fend off the pursuit by framing the inquisition as the opposition playing \u201cpolitical games\u201d.\nMorrison shrugged off negative commentary from the former anti-corruption commissioner and senior judge David Ipp, who told Guardian Australia the prime minister\u2019s call to the NSW police chief looked like an inappropriate attempt to use his position to make a political decision.\nThe prime minister said Fuller had said publicly he had not raised anything inappropriate during their conversation and if \u201cthe leader of the opposition wants to cast aspersions against the NSW police commissioner he can do so\u201d. Morrison said Labor had not raised any objections about the call when Morrison telegraphed in parliament he intended to make it.\nEven though police have begun an investigation into whether a cabinet minister or his staff have committed serious offences, Morrison sought to characterise ongoing questions in parliament as \u201cpolitical games being played by a leader of the opposition who is more interested in the drama and the carryings on of Canberra politics than he is in the serious issues that are being raised in this place\u201d.\nTaylor was also asked on Thursday whether he stood by his previous statements that neither he, nor his office, altered the Sydney City Council document that was used, erroneously, to attack Clover Moore\u2019s travel.\nThe minister for emissions reduction said: \u201cI reject absolutely the suggestion that I or any members of my staff altered the documents in question\u201d. Taylor said Labor had overreached in pursuing the issue, and had \u201ca track record of using police referrals as a political tool\u201d.\nIn the course of attempting to fend off Labor\u2019s ongoing parliamentary attack, Morrison also misled the House on four occasions on Wednesday and Thursday, infuriating the opposition.",

But a gravitational downwards pull tugs at the film, though I wasn\u2019t convinced it has the emotional depth for the dark places Gillan wants to take it.\nAs well as writing and directing, she plays underachieving 24-year-old Liusaidh (pronounced \u201cLucy\u201d), who lives with her parents and works behind the cheese and ham counter at the local supermarket. The film begins with a Trainspotting-ish drunken rant by Liusaidh about the shitness of Inverness; later she tells a guy that she drinks to make her job bearable. \u201cYou can\u2019t really conjure up the energy to resent it through a hangover.\u201d\nBut Gillan\u2019s film isn\u2019t really about disaffection or despair. Liusaidh\u2019s nihilism is driven by grief after the suicide of her best friend, Alistair (sensitively played by Matthew Beard).\nIn flashbacks, we watch Liusaidh with thoughtful, introverted Alistair, a gay man in a hopeless relationship with an evangelical Christian. Back to the present, all unprocessed guilt and anger, she gets pissed and shags randoms in pub toilets. Towards the end there is a scene of sexual violence that Gillan doesn\u2019t give enough space to explore, adding to the film\u2019s undernourished, unfinished feel.\nElsewhere, there\u2019s some fun banter between Liusaidh and a friend (Rachel Jackson), and these scenes have a relaxed and unselfconscious truthfulness to them. I can\u2019t help thinking Gillan\u2019s superpower as a writer and performer might actually be comedy. Still, always a compelling screen presence, she\u2019s now a film-maker to watch.\n The Party\u2019s Just Beginning is released in the UK on 1 December.",

The vote was a major win for unions, which had been furiously lobbying the Senate crossbench not to pass the bill, warning that industrial action, including campaigns for nurse-to-patient ratios, could trigger deregistration under the draconian new laws.\nAttorney general Christian Porter said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the result and suggested the government may reintroduce bill \u2013 but the Australian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O\u2019Neil confidently predicted it would be \u201chumiliated\u201d if it did.\nIn a statement Hanson said despite amendments \u201cthere was a quantity of non-amendable changes that prevented our full support\u201d, including powers for court-appointed administrators to take over the functions of a union.\nAt a press conference, Hanson and Roberts cited inaction on corporate crime including the differential penalties for the 23m alleged breaches of anti-money laundering provisions by Westpac as another reason.\nACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said that the message from the vote was \u201cdon\u2019t mess with working people\u201d and that people \u201cdon\u2019t like double standards\u201d on legal breaches by unions, companies or politicians.\nBoth O\u2019Neil and Hanson ruled out any quid pro quos in return for One Nation support, with Hanson insisting she would \u201cnever base [her] vote on that\u201d.\nDespite recounting stories of workers calling her office in tears to thank her for blocking the bill, Hanson warned the Senate debate was a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d of unions, reserving the right to vote it through in future if unions did not stop behaviour she characterised as \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201ccorruption\u201d.\nIf the government reintroduces the bill, Hanson said she will \u201cassess it at the time\u201d and her vote is \u201cnot guaranteed the next time\u201d.\nEarlier in the week, Hanson had twice warned One Nation would not be rushed on the bill, and twice said the government could not take its votes for granted.\nBut despite never publicly committing to vote one way or the other, One Nation\u2019s contributions in Senate debate and backroom negotiations had led the government to believe passage of the bill was an inevitability.\n Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe attorney general Christian Porter agreed to joint amendments with Centre Alliance and a separate set from One Nation, which created a demerit point system and required an actual penalty to have been imposed by a court, rather than just a finding of wrongdoing.\nOn Wednesday senator Malcolm Roberts told the Senate that One Nation would not stand for \u201cunion-bashing\u201d or a bill that allowed deregistration for misdemeanours like late paperwork \u2013 which was still allowed by the bill, if unions breached rules three times.\nRoberts went on to lash \u201crogue\u201d union officials who he said \u201cmust \u2026 be held to account\u201d and noted that One Nation\u2019s \u201cpositive improvements\u201d to the bill had been accepted.\nEarlier on Thursday, Anthony Albanese refused to comment on the hypothetical of what Labor would do if the bill passed.\nLambie \u2013 who had said that if militant construction unionist John Setka did not stand aside the bill would pass \u2013 nevertheless sought to amend it and then ultimately opposed the bill.\nHer amendments would have required a review after 12 months and excluded \u201ca failure or refusal by the person to attend for work\u201d from the list of breaches that could trigger deregistration. These amendments were voted down, although both One Nation and Centre Alliance amendments were accepted before the ultimate defeat.\nLambie hit out at the government\u2019s negotiating style, saying they had not been prepared to entertain her amendments, and she had not met with Porter about her proposed changes to the bill.\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even talk to me about it, they knocked me straight out of the game. I\u2019m assuming they thought they had the numbers,\u201d Lambie told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cNo one wanted to deal with me over this bill, they should have left all of their options open.\n\u201cCutting me completely out, that was one vote they already lost, that is not smart politics, that is plain stupid.\u201d\nIn Senate debate on Wednesday the Centre Alliance senator, Rex Patrick, noted that the federal circuit court judge Salvatore Vasta had labelled the Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy the most \u201crecidivist corporate offender in Australian history\u201d.\nPatrick told the Senate the amended bill was not a \u201cunion-busting\u201d law, accusing unions of \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cfear-mongering\u201d claims.\nPatrick claimed that only \u201csystematic conduct\u201d was targeted, so three \u201cmistakes\u201d by a union breaching separate and unrelated provisions would not trigger deregistration.",

        "content": "New strategy of appealing to leavers in Midlands and north as poll predicts Tory majority\nJeremy Corbyn has attempted to play down Labour\u2019s general election strategy shake-up for the last two weeks of the campaign as the party pivots towards trying to save vulnerable heartlands in the north and Midlands.\nThe Labour party leader insisted he would take the same anti-austerity message to all parts of the country at his \u201cplan for nature\u201d launch in Southampton. Yet, behind the scenes, strategists are instigating a switch from going after Tory marginals to consolidating seats they already hold and trying to win back leave voters.\nThe party suffered a bruising result in the YouGov MRP poll, which put Labour on just 211 seats, its lowest since 1983.\n\u201cOur campaign is in every part of the country. I am travelling all around the country. I say the same thing at every place I go. I don\u2019t have one message for one group,\u201d Corbyn said, addressing questions that his campaign is about to change course.\n\u201cI say the same message everywhere. Vote Labour in order to get a government that will deal with the inequalities and poverty and injustice austerity has heaped on this country.\u201d\nBut the Guardian understands that after beginning the campaign with a resolutely offensive strategy, the party recognises that it now has much more to do to hold constituencies in Brexit-voting areas.\nIt plans to hammer home the benefits of a pared-down set of its manifesto commitments that will put money directly in the pockets of voters in these constituencies.\nLabour strategists also say they will focus relentlessly on the risk of returning Boris Johnson to No 10 for five years, and seek to make the election a binary choice between Labour and the Tories in the hope of squeezing the Liberal Democrat vote further.\nUnder the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids \u2018\u201cwasting\u201d your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.\nEven before Wednesday evening\u2019s YouGov projection, which gave Boris Johnson a 68-seat majority and predicted Labour would lose 44 seats, party strategists were concerned about the imperative of appealing to leave supporters.\nThey point out that even in the 2017 general election, the six seats Labour lost were all in leave areas; and, even in those they held, the increase in Labour\u2019s vote share was significantly lower than elsewhere.\nThe YouGov projection, which showed the Lib Dems failing to make inroads in many of the seats Labour is targeting, has strengthened the hand of those who have been making that argument internally. These include the \u201cfour Ms\u201d \u2013 Seumas Milne, Andrew Murray, Len McCluskey and Karie Murphy, Labour sources suggested.\nIt was McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, who warned against expanding freedom of movement, as some Labour activists had hoped to.\nIn traditional Labour heartlands the reaction among candidates to a new focus on their constituencies was mixed.\nGreat Grimsby candidate Melanie Onn said she had not had a single visit arranged centrally to help her defend her 2,565-majority in her heavily leave-voting seat, so was surprised to hear about a shift in focus to the north of England and Midlands.\n\u201cI\u2019ll just have to wait and see what this refocus is, I\u2019m not really sure what it means,\u201d she said.\nThe shadow health minister, Jon Ashworth, appears to be acting as a bridge between Corbyn, his shadow cabinet and those candidates in northern and Midland constituencies with a leave majority.\nAs well as helping Onn launch her campaign he has also visited Stoke, which voted 72% leave, for a joint event in support of Labour candidates there.\nSonya Ward, who is trying to take back the traditional Labour heartland seat of Mansfield from Tory Ben Bradley, said she had been frequently visited by the shadow cabinet \u2013 including Corbyn. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty well supported to be honest.\u201d\nOne Labour source in a heartland seat said: \u201cI think they have seen the polls, after ignoring the polls for a long time. Six months ago I started saying we were losing our vote. To be honest I think they\u2019ve realised a little bit too late that they\u2019ve been more interested in trying to save Emily Thornberry\u2019s seat in Islington than Labour heartlands.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s Barry Sheerman, defending Huddersfield, which voted 51% leave in the referendum, said he would welcome more support for his colleagues in Yorkshire.\nWhile he has a healthy 12,000-majority, some female politicians elsewhere in the region risk losing their seats. The Tories are predicted to pick up three seats in South Yorkshire, including Don Valley, Penistone and Stocksbridge and Rother Valley, and four in West Yorkshire including Dewsbury, Keighley and Wakefield.\nHe said: \u201cI think anything that targets any vulnerable seats where we have got absolutely first-class MPs \u2013 some of whom are the leading female MPs in parliament \u2013 is important, so any help that can be brought to them I would really welcome.\u201d",

Morrison could have insisted Taylor step aside for the duration of the police investigation, in the process blunting the rolling interrogation of the parliamentary week. Instead he elected to keep the minister in his position, in full public view, paralysed by a police investigation, because Labor couldn\u2019t be given a scalp.\nThen Morrison called the NSW police commissioner, by his own account, to find out whether or not there was a police investigation into Taylor, perhaps momentarily forgetting he had at his disposal a whole private office staffed with competent people and a whole department of professionals who could have made that inquiry in an entirely appropriate way on his behalf.\nThis overreach was the wrong thing to do on a number of levels, some of which I\u2019ve already ventilated, but perhaps the worst of the misjudgment is the shadow it casts across the entire process.\nJust think about it.\nIn the event the NSW police come back next week, or whenever, and report that Taylor and his office have no case to answer, there will be an ongoing public debate about whether or not this has been a proper and thorough investigation, or whether it has been tainted by politics.\nThis debate will happen in large part because Morrison rushed to the phone, rather than just taking a quiet minute to think whether the government needed a prime minister or a saviour right at that moment.\nNow perhaps the prime minister doesn\u2019t care about the inconvenience of his actions having consequences, because on current form this will be everybody else\u2019s fault. Labor\u2019s mostly. Probably Guardian Australia, too, for \u2026 how did he put it on Thursday? Pulling Anthony Albanese\u2019s chain.\n\u201cWe know who\u2019s pulling his chain\u201d: Scott Morrison says Anthony Albanese only became concerned about his phone call to the NSW police commissioner regarding an investigation into Angus Taylor after \u201che read it in the Guardian\u201d. Follow live: https://t.co/qpDHygX3q2 #auspol #qt pic.twitter.com/wvpENhQog9\nDear, dear. Boo hoo. I mean, seriously? You\u2019d say grow up and stop sulking \u2013 because being in power in 2019 is hard as hell, and the price of entry to government is being accountable for your actions \u2013 but what would be the point of the counsel, well intentioned as it is, when Scott knows best, about everything?\nThe other more than mildly disturbing element of the week was Morrison\u2019s preparedness to be sloppy and unrepentant about being sloppy in full public view, from the call to the police commissioner, to misleading the chamber on four separate occasions over the past couple of days \u2013 really quite brazen behaviour I haven\u2019t seen in Canberra before.\nWe have washed up in the post-truth era, an untethered hell of our own making, a hall of mirrors. Emboldened by opportunity, a number of politicians around the world are seeking to govern in a consequence-free universe, not seeking to trouble the discourse with facts or stabilising conventions.\nThe mark of the post-truth politician is the preparedness to pit themselves against their own institutions, to trash the lot in an effort to fly free, saying all the things, feeling all the feels.\nUntil this week, I\u2019ve felt that comparisons between Morrison and Donald Trump have been way overblown. Now, I\u2019m not so sure.",

        "content": "By embracing vulnerability at a time when all the old rules about the genre were breaking down, the LA collective broadened what it could be\nLast year, the three most streamed artists across the globe on Spotify were all North American rappers \u2013 Drake, Post Malone and XXXTentacion \u2013 the culmination of a decade in which rap became the world\u2019s dominant pop music. It\u2019s a genre now so wide and plural that sweeping statements about it become nonsensical, and so many figures in the last decade have helped move it to its current place in the firmament: the DIY spirit and uncontained impulses of Lil B; the monolithic repetitive one-bar melodies of Chief Keef; Nicki Minaj\u2019s weaponising of drama and persona. The scene\u2019s biggest star, Drake, is interestingly both highly influential and heavily influenced.\nBut one rap collective is a case study in how the genre flourished, expanded and culturally dominated this decade, and also functions as a Seven Up-type social experiment in seeing people grow in real time. Odd Future \u2013 or Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All to give their full name \u2013 emerged as teenagers from Los Angeles in 2008, in a hail of encrusted tube socks and profanity. After a flurry of group mixtapes, its members grew up and amicably became independent of one another, just as groups of teenagers are wont to do. Various artists from their number would go on to release some of the best rap, funk and R&B music of the period \u2013 Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd \u2013 and others, such as Domo Genesis and MellowHype, put out future cult classics. Normalised to the always-on broadcasting of social media and the droll surrealism of meme culture, they carved out new space for rap, becoming the bards of the confessional impulse that gripped our culture from Twitter to reality TV.\nThe first time I saw them live was the first time anyone in the UK had seen them: their first London gig in 2010, in the basement of the Stoke Newington pub where I worked. I let myself downstairs and all I remember is a hail of limbs; everyone on stage seemed to be like one of those flappy inflatable humans you see outside car showrooms. Here and on record, they were being powered by the same batteries that juiced up Jackass, or punk, or anything else that has historically annoyed parents.\nThis energy fed the genius of Tyler, the Creator, the group\u2019s central MC. His early work sounds like it\u2019s coming from a mouth with just the faintest hint of a sly grin curling up at the sides \u2013 he dares you to think he\u2019s being serious. It\u2019s the deadpan cruelty of a kid too advanced for the rest of his class, and even the teacher. As well as playing up, he shows off \u2013 there is a brilliant musicality to his Ren and Stimpy vision of sex on French!, for instance: \u201cI guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber / And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers / Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba / This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp\u201d. Unfortunately for him, Theresa May\u2019s Home Office banned him from the country, a decision that led to feverish excitement on his eventual return, and an edge of outlaw danger.\nThe lurid gross-out vibe had previously worked for Eminem, who similarly spiked his tracks with comic ultraviolence, and whose whiteness made him that much more relatable (or, depressingly, palatable) to the large white audiences in the US and UK \u2013 no travel ban for him, of course. Odd Future were black, but sat closer to the traditionally white-majority space of skate culture than mainstream rap \u2013 and they were \u201cmoving from middle to upper class\u201d, as Syd would soon rap. The \u201csuper rich kids\u201d Earl Sweatshirt complains of on the Frank Ocean song of the same name are a class above him, but he\u2019s still in their bratty orbit. The glamorous underclass violence and sheer otherness of gangsta rap had been alluring to ogling white audiences, but here was something even more enticing: authentic for being black, accessible for existing in middle-class white spaces, and saying crude, funny, clever things. This blend attracted a cult following, which was swiftly monetised through the kind of hypebeast-streetwear merch (branded Golf Wang, a play on Wolf Gang) that tends to be bought by those with a considerable disposable income. Sure enough, when I next saw Tyler perform, this time in London\u2019s Roundhouse, sat behind me were five white pubescent boys all wearing Supreme caps in different designs. It\u2019s a tension that Odd Future noticed: the cerebral Earl Sweatshirt complained of being \u201ctoo black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks\u201d on his track, Chum, while the hornier Tyler fretted on Bastard: \u201cI\u2019m tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck / Drunk white girls the only way I\u2019ll get my dick sucked.\u201d\nThese jaded half-boasts also point to another key part of Odd Future\u2019s appeal: vulnerability. You could probably plot their rugged, slapdash production and fiendishly clever, free-ranging flow in a line with Wu-Tang Clan or MF Doom, but you\u2019d rarely hear those artists be as confessional as Odd Future\u2019s members. There was plenty of hip-hop\u2019s boastfulness, but various other rap cliches were nowhere to be seen, be they luxury brands and cars at one end, or guns on the other. Some filed them alongside the schlocky violence of horrorcore rap, but Tyler rejected this.\nFor years America had focused on its feelings, from expensive therapy to TV shows such as My So-Called Life and Dawson\u2019s Creek, whose plots were driven entirely by remarkably articulate expressions of emotion (and seemed as exotic to Brits as US gangsta rap). Blogging and social media allowed this impulse to flow naturally, and Odd Future came of age during this time when it became normal, even expected, for you to spill your inner life into a public realm. Tyler even used the framing device of a therapy session \u2013 another middle-class trope \u2013 to give structure to his diatribes against his absent father and his new urges.\nIndeed, daddy issues were a notable theme. Tyler was unrepentant: \u201cFuck a deal, I just want my father\u2019s email / So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\u201d, but Earl was more even-handed: \u201cI just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest / When honestly I miss this nigga\u201d. A later Earl track, Playing Possum, extended an olive branch by poetically weaving speeches by his parents over each other \u2013 tragically, his father died before he could hear it. Earl\u2019s radical emotional transparency is essayed in the very way he raps, his words endlessly rolling over line breaks, the sound of that constant spill. One line sums it up: \u201cSay goodbye to my openness, total eclipse / Of my shine that I\u2019ve grown to miss when holding shit in\u201d \u2013 a paradoxical admission, being candid about staying silent, knowing that his candour is both soothing and the source of his creative \u201cshine\u201d. The rhyme scheme, as ever, has a casual perfection.\nThis frankness, and willingness to explore one\u2019s interior life, extended to sexuality. Rap has often been homophobic, with plenty of use of the other F-word \u2013 one of the buttons that Tyler himself pushed, reasoning that \u201cit hits\u201d \u2013 and as recently as 2017 you had mainstream stars such as Offset claiming he was unaware of the homophobia in his line \u201cI cannot vibe with queers\u201d. But Syd, once Odd Future\u2019s DJ and then a solo artist and member of cosmic funk band the Internet, was out and proud \u2013 it was refreshing to have her bedroom-R&B solo record be so open about lesbian sex. At one point she coos admiringly, with that aforementioned yuppie aspiration, at a woman who \u201cdrive a Beemer and she got it on her own\u201d.\nTyler has gone from being accused of homophobia to sort-of coming out with a jokey tweet, dropping in lines such as \u201cI\u2019ve been kissing white boys since 2004\u201d and eventually writing an entire album, Igor, about a love affair with a man. His unwillingness to put a neat bow on his sexuality chimes with a world where, in the UK, 54% of 18 to 24-year-olds say they are not 100% heterosexual, and his playful lack of clarity is testament to the messiness of that journey for many people. It is all uncharted territory for him, indeed for hip-hop; it is impossible to quantify, but it feels as if he is influencing this sexual culture as much as it is influencing him.\nYou could say the same for Frank Ocean. Mainstream male R&B can be even more heteronormative than rap, with the likes of Luther Vandross closeted by music that acts as a lubricant for sex in a majority-straight culture; as Ocean himself said in 2012: \u201cIn black music, we\u2019ve got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance\u201d. But Ocean broke the rules, not just for what a male R&B musician could be, but also of the genre itself.\nLike Tyler, he is part of a generation less inclined to label themselves, never describing himself as gay or bisexual \u2013 \u201clife is dynamic\u201d, he once said \u2013 but singing candidly of love and sex with men. Is this resistance, even subconsciously, borne out of fear of rejection by their audiences? That\u2019s perhaps a reach; more interesting is how that resistance to being boxed in also shapes their music. Ocean is the great poet of modern R&B and Odd Future\u2019s most revered member of all, with his album, Blonde, rightly being canonised as the finest of the decade. Its impressionistic daubs sit outside genre concerns altogether; it is \u201crhythm and blues\u201d in those words\u2019 most pure, literal sense. The album as a whole has a rhythm, is a rhythm; there are blues in the sense of different sadnesses, different shades, from inky midnights to duck-egg mornings, and of course he plays the blues, too.\nTyler meanwhile now sings as well as raps, and Igor, adding to the cosmic-boogie leanings of previous records, is essentially a neo-soul album. At his UK comeback gigs, thousands of people were singing \u201cdon\u2019t leave, it\u2019s my fault\u201d along with Tyler, certainly an oddity at a rap show. With his Flower Boy album, stoner humour, and the bucolic vibes of some of the Golf Wang clothing (such as a hoodie reading Save the Bees) there\u2019s a strain of Cali psychedelia, too. Praising skate brand Fucking Awesome, Tyler once said, resisting definition: \u201cI think that vibe defines my music. It\u2019s not rap, it\u2019s not jazz \u2013 it\u2019s Fucking Awesome!\u201d The arrival of social media and interconnectedness perhaps informed not just Odd Future\u2019s emotional candour, but their tastes, and they typify the cultural omnivorousness of their generation, who \u2013 outside the intense tribalism of stan culture \u2013 are normalised to liking a bit of everything, because there\u2019s always a bit of everything on offer. This permissiveness, where everything can be cool if you say it is, has dissolved irony, and Tyler is the perfect example of that too: his fondness for jauntily dapper suits and golf clothing is sarcastic and sincere all at the same time.\nIn their punk energy, blithe attitude to sex, and their willingness to be vulnerable and confessional, Odd Future\u2019s merry, messy band have been a definitive force in rap this decade, using their charisma and business nous to bring the underground and overground together just as digital culture was also erasing all the old cultural borders. What\u2019s most startling is how young they still are. \u201cFeeling rushed, grew up quick / Trip around the sun, this my 25th,\u201d Earl raps on the excellent recent mini-album Feet of Clay. He also admits: \u201cSunny day but I\u2019m cooking inside / Muddy path but I\u2019m taking my time.\u201d They\u2019ve spent more than ten years churning up the ground behind them, cooking inside, and there\u2019s still so much more ahead.",

Here are some more unusual assists from Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Lionel Messi, Mario Balotelli and er, Danny Welbeck, plus a lesson in never giving up from the J-League. Messi is a master of supine skills but even he can\u2019t keep up with James Milner \u2013 or Phil Jones.\nAs for goals scored from the floor, Harry Kane has form this season. Montreal Impact\u2019s Hassoun Camara offers a sitting bicycle kick, Fernando Parra won\u2019t be denied, and here\u2019s a touch of finesse from Mainz\u2019s Jairo Samperio. In Turkey, Milan Baros shows off a ruthless streak that was lacking at Liverpool. Finally, Rennes\u2019 Paul-Georges Ntep serves up a playground classic back in 2014.\n2) If you\u2019re going to take this long on the run-up, you\u2019d better score the penalty.\n3) College prospect Lynn Bowden is making waves at Kentucky. The wide receiver has been a revelation since making an emergency switch to quarterback, but gave us a glimpse of his skills when back in high school, turning a muffed punt into something very special.\n4) In college hoops, meanwhile, Stephen F Austin pulled off an all-time upset at Duke, grabbing the win in overtime thanks to Nathan Bain\u2019s coast-to-coast, lay-up buzzer beater. Here\u2019s another wild finish from the NBA, as the Bulls overturn a seven-point deficit with 30 seconds to play. In Denver, former Broncos QB Peyton Manning took in a Nuggets game, and showed he\u2019s still got it. Shame about the receiver, though.\n5) Playing out from a bunker, with two shots in hand to land a $5m payday, Jon Rahm chips nervelessly to set up a winning birdie putt in Dubai. Bunker escape of the year, mind, goes to Tiger Woods with this physics-defying effort from the WGC event in Mexico. Woods\u2019 old rival, Phil Mickelson, is a master of the art, as this highlight reel shows. And if you can\u2019t be that good, be lucky.\n6) Michael van Gerwen warms up for Ally Pally with the first televised nine-darter of the year; a perfect excuse to revisit his 17 perfect darts at the Palace in 2013.

The legislation, approved unanimously by the US senate and by all but one member of the House, threatens sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese government officials accused of human rights abuses amid the semi-autonomous city\u2019s continuing political unrest. Beijing said the bill was \u201ca pure interference in China\u2019s internal affairs \u2026 full of prejudice and arrogance.\u201d\nPolice break siege. Police have peacefully entered Hong Kong Polytechnic University after a 10-day siege, despite pleas from activists who said up to 20 protesters were still holed up inside the campus.\nA group of scientists writing in the journal Nature have warned the world may already have passed one or more climate \u201ctipping points\u201d, putting humanity in a \u201cstate of planetary emergency\u201d that poses \u201can existential threat to civilisation\u201d. Such points are reached when a major impact of global heating becomes unstoppable, for example the loss of rainforests or polar ice sheets. One of those impacts alone, the researchers warned, could lead to a cascade of others.\nSouth Korea pollution. South Korea has announced plans to shut down up to a quarter of its coal-fired power plants over the winter to combat dangerously high levels of dust pollution.\nMassive Attack. Trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack have been touring the globe for decades. Now they have commissioned a report to assess the carbon emissions impact of the live music touring industry, in hopes of eliminating its effects.\nGordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women who say he retaliated against them after they rejected his advances. Sondland, whose neck-deep involvement in the Ukraine scandal has made him a key witness in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, has categorically denied the claims, saying he believes they were \u201cconcocted and \u2026 coordinated for political purposes\u201d.\n\u2018Unwanted kissing\u2019. One of the accusers, a potential business partner, told ProPublica that Sondland had tried to kiss her during a tour of one of the hotels he owns, and then withdrew his offer of investment in her business after she rebuffed him.\nLawyers and leading human rights activists in Brazil are calling for the indictment of the country\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro by the International Criminal Court, claiming he has encouraged genocide against Brazil\u2019s indigenous tribes. Since taking power, Bolsonaro has compared indigenous people to zoo animals and \u201cprehistoric men\u201d, made efforts to dismantle the agency responsible for protecting the country\u2019s more than 300 tribes and pushed to open up their tribal lands to mining companies.\n\u2018Informative note.\u2019 The campaigners on Wednesday delivered a request to an ICC prosecutor in the Hague for a \u201cpreliminary investigation of incitement to genocide and widespread systematic attacks against indigenous peoples\u201d by Bolsonaro.\nFive people have been killed in a fire at a public housing high-rise in Minneapolis\u2019s Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, which is known as Little Mogadishu for the many Somali immigrants who have settled there.\nExperts have questioned Trump\u2019s decision to label Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations, suggesting the new designation would be mostly cosmetic \u2013 unless the president requires a pretext for US military incursions.\nAhead of the UK\u2019s general election, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party has obtained documents which, it says, prove Boris Johnson and the Conservatives plan to put the National Health Service \u201con the table\u201d in a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.\nThe Chicago home of Jeff Tweedy, the frontman for the Grammy-winning rock band Wilco, was shot at at least seven times early on Tuesday morning.

Three years on, her group Voters not Politicians has succeeded in stripping redistricting power from lawmakers, as Sam Levine reports.\nCalifornia islands tackle a plague of mice\nThe Farallon Islands off northern California are home to 300,000 breeding seabirds, five species of seals and sea lions, and a unique variety of cricket. They also contain more than a thousand mice per acre, a growing threat to the islands\u2019 rich biodiversity.

I have to assume it is infinite, and they will never stop. Anyway, I am not a boomer, as I was born long after the mid-60s, and nor are/were my parents, who fall into what went before \u2013 the silent or beat generation. These distinctions are important when it comes to cooking, because boomers cook one way (the women can\u2019t cook at all, because of feminism, and they vie with each other to see who can do the most disgusting thing to an aubergine; the men all cook like Keith Floyd), Generation X cooks another way and the beat generation does things that must be recorded now, because once they have passed out of fashion, they will never be discovered again.\nThey have weird skills, derived from scarcity in their early years. They keep their spices in brown glass because they last longer. For practical purposes, this means everything is in an old Calpol bottle with \u201csumac\u201d scrawled over it. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make them thrifty. Some of them are, and will fish an empty packet of sugar out of the bin, shake a quarter-teaspoon of sugar from it and put it back; my stepmother still insists that you shouldn\u2019t use fat when you\u2019re frying bacon, because it already has fat. Others are wildly profligate, especially with fat, as if living a lifetime of astonishment that the 50s are over, and you\u2019re now allowed to fry bread in dripping, and then put butter on it. They all love dripping; they all love black pudding. Actually, so do I, so this isn\u2019t really a generational thing.\nThey can often make a cake by eye, without weighing anything, which I find incredible, and they know what to do with leaf gelatine, which is great until it isn\u2019t. My mother once made avocado in jelly and then said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, the proportions may have been slightly off.\u201d I said, recklessly: \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll choke it down,\u201d but when it came to it, my cutlery bounced off it, like a prank played on a very hungry person in a cartoon.\nThe beat generation canon is Meat at Any Price and Fish at Any Price (both by Ninette Lyon) and anything to do with mince (the mince bible is Marvellous Meals with Mince, by Jocelyn Dimbleby). The descent of mince from a sacred food to a bolognese-only staple is one of the great mysteries of progress, because it is delicious even when you don\u2019t shove a load of tomato in it. But you have to treat it with respect \u2013 you can\u2019t just shove cheap meat in a pan and watch while it sweats out watery grey juice. This seems to be something that only wartime generations understand.\nHow you treat a vegetable works in a generational pendulum; it\u2019s a bit like the \u201ccycles of violence\u201d explanation of history, only all the violence is unleashed upon the vegetable. Hip parents in the 70s, or regular parents in the 80s, or quite trad parents in the 90s had a horror of overcooked carrots and waterlogged cabbage. The very smell of cooked vegetables evoked for them every bad memory of British cuisine, before anchovies and Italians and radicchio arrived, when all dinner was a school dinner. So they would all just tease their vegetables with a hint of boiling water, before turning them out, still basically a salad, only a bit warmer. Then you, their offspring, would leave home, and accidentally encounter a vegetable that had been cooked, and realise how delicious it was \u2013 especially a steamed parsnip, which is sometimes called poor man\u2019s lobster, for no good reason, as it tastes nothing like lobster \u2013 and now you probably overcook your vegetables a bit, and your children will go the other way.\nJust as it\u2019s amazing how many tunes you can make with only eight notes, it is amazing how few decent things you can do to a cauliflower. Everyone over 60 puts cheese on it; everyone under 60 roasts it. Those are the only two things you can do. So sue me.\nMy dad had amazing butchery skills, could bone a quail in five minutes and would always look nonplussed if he bought a chicken in a supermarket but couldn\u2019t find its spleen when he looked inside, like his Kinder egg was missing its toy. Knife skills definitely affect the way you cook, nudging you away from fillets of things and towards whole things, so that nothing ever takes 30 minutes, but everything tastes better. Unfortunately, you inherit a preference for whole beasts but cannot inherit the skills, so you\u2019re constantly trying to spatchcock with just a pair of blunt scissors and a variable amount of enthusiasm.",

        "content": "The Guardian\u2019s theatre critic was at the sketch group\u2019s first show in 1960. It was the beginning of a friendship \u2026 and a satire boom that changed the world\nMy first sighting of Jonathan Miller was at the Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh in August 1960. I was present, as a student critic, at the slightly chaotic but utterly brilliant first night of Beyond the Fringe. I knew of Miller\u2019s reputation, as a kind of Cambridge Danny Kaye, but nothing quite prepared me for his loping, gangling presence or for his dazzling way with words.\nIn the show, Miller was both a team player and a striking soloist. I still recall his monologue about searching for a pair of secondhand trousers in a lost property office and how, \u201cafter a good deal of moral contortion, I steeled myself to the alien crutch\u201d.\nBut Miller was equally funny as a linguistic philosopher, in a sketch with Alan Bennett, claiming \u201cwe want to ask not so much why questions as how questions\u201d. And in a hilarious parody of Shakespeare history plays with their endless proper names, Miller memorably cried \u201cGet thee to Gloucester, Essex,\u201d although Peter Cook had the best line with, \u201cOh saucy Worcester, dost thou lie so still?\u201d I\u2019ve often argued that Beyond the Fringe, which spawned a satire boom that spread to TV and print as well as launching the careers of its four participants \u2013 including Dudley Moore \u2013 had a more lasting impact on the culture than anything in postwar theatre.\nBut my experience of Miller did not end there. I went to a midweek press conference by the Fringe quartet and asked some, as I thought, obvious questions about their purpose. Afterwards Miller came leaping over to me and a fellow student, and said: \u201cYou\u2019re clearly not professional journalists. Who are you?\u201d It was a mark of Miller\u2019s boundless curiosity, which went even further when he asked if there was anything in the show we thought didn\u2019t work. I ventured to suggest that a sketch in which a refugee goes into a charity shop, is kitted out with new clothes and comes out looking worse than when he went in, was a bit of a one-joke affair. To my astonishment, when I had a second look at the show at a Thursday matinee, the sketch had been removed.\nI\u2019m sure it had less to do with me than with the fact that the cast themselves realised the sketch hadn\u2019t worked. But that encounter with Miller taught me a lot of things about his genuine interest in other people and his willingness to hoover up ideas. In later years, I interviewed him a number of times and we became quite friendly \u2013 a happy state that was abruptly terminated when I gave a critical review of his production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. But I still cherish memories of my meetings with Miller and, in particular, of his performance in Beyond the Fringe which showed that, like all great comics, he combined verbal inventiveness with a physical image that you can never forget.",

        "content": "Bristol band team up with academics from Manchester University to share tour data\nLast week Coldplay announced they were to stop touring until they were sure it would be carbon neutral; now Massive Attack are partnering with academics to map the carbon footprint of the music industry.\nThe researchers from Manchester University\u2019s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research will analyse data from Massive Attack\u2019s touring and recording schedule to look at three key areas where CO2 emissions are generated: band travel and production, audience transport and venue.\nThe aim is to provide information and guidance to the wider music industry so that it can reduce its negative environmental impact in light of the increasing climate emergency.\n\u201cIn an emergency context, business as usual \u2013 regardless of its nature, high profile or popularity \u2013 is unacceptable,\u201d wrote Robert Del Naja, AKA 3D, Massive Attack\u2019s vocalist, in an article for the Guardian, explaining the collaboration.\nHe said the band had tried carbon offsetting for almost 20 years, paying to have trees planted, prohibiting the use of single-use plastics and travelling by train wherever feasible. But they had come to the conclusion that \u201coffsetting creates an illusion that high-carbon activities enjoyed by wealthier individuals can continue, by transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others \u2013 generally those in the poorer nations in the southern hemisphere\u201d.\nDel Naja said the band did not want to stop playing big shows or festivals, but that huge change was essential for the planet\u2019s future.\n\u201cGiven the current polarised social atmosphere, uplifting and unifying cultural events are arguably more important now than ever, and no one would want to see them postponed or even cancelled. The challenge therefore is to avoid more pledges, promises and greenwashing headlines and instead embrace seismic change,\u201d he wrote.\nDr Chris Jones, a research fellow at Tyndall Manchester, said: \u201cWe will be working with Massive Attack to look at sources of carbon emissions from a band\u2019s touring schedule. Every industry has varying degrees of carbon impact to address and we need partnerships like this one to look at reducing carbon emissions across the board.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more effective to have a sustained process of emissions reductions across the sector than for individual artists to quit live performances. It will likely mean a major shift in how things are done now, involving not just the band but the rest of the business and the audience.\u201d\nThe collaboration will produce a framework based on data gathered from Massive Attack\u2019s forthcoming tour.\nThis year, Glastonbury festival banned single-use plastic, and an increasing number of artists are taking steps to reduce their environmental footprint.\nIn an interview with BBC News last week, Coldplay\u2019s frontman, Chris Martin, said the group were waiting to tour their new album, Everyday Life, so they could ensure such a tour was carbon neutral. \u201cOur next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,\u201d said Martin. \u201cWe would be disappointed if it\u2019s not carbon neutral. We\u2019ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it\u2019s not so much taking as giving?\u201d\nThe solo artist Billie Eilish\u2019s next tour, in March, will feature the \u201cBillie Eilish eco-village\u201d, where fans can learn about their role in the climate crisis. Those who pledge to fight the climate emergency with the organisation Global Citizen can earn free tickets to the sold-out shows.\nThe 1975 are working towards making their tours carbon-efficient and have pledged to plant a tree for every ticket sold for their UK arena tour in February. The British band have also stopped producing new T-shirts, instead screen-printing a new design over old merchandise stock.",

The move is designed to cut \u00a3100m in costs by 2022 under TSB\u2019s new chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, who is seeking to draw a line under last year\u2019s IT meltdown.\nTSB said it would seek to keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum, and that it had consulted with the Unite and Accord unions. The bank will continue to have a national branch network across Britain, with 65% of the population living within four miles of a TSB branch.\nRobin Bulloch, customer banking director at TSB, said: \u201cWe have made the difficult decision to close 82 branches, today announcing the locations. We will fully support customers through this transition.\n\u201cWe realise this is difficult news for our branch partners and will do everything to support those affected to offer voluntary redundancies and redeploy as many people as we can to other roles.\u201d\nThe bank argues that when it was spun out from Lloyds Banking Group in 2013, it ended up holding twice as many branches per 10,000 customers as competitors. In the last two years, TSB has seen branch transactions drop by 17% as customers increasingly choose to bank online or by phone.\nHere is a list of the planned branch closures in 2020.\nNorth-east\nWigton (June)\nNewcastle Upon Tyne \u2013 Chillingham Road (September)\nNorth-west\nUrmston (June)\nChester (June)\nChorlton, Manchester (October)\nCongleton (October)\nWarrington \u2013 Penketh (October)\nLeyland (November)\nSt Annes-on-Sea (November)\nOrmskirk (November)\nYorkshire/Humberside\nHeadingley, Leeds (February)\nThorne (April)\nSkipton (May)\nHull \u2013 Willerby (May)\nNormanton (May)\nTodmorden (June)\nBrough (July)\nMarket Weighton (July)\nShipley (November)\nHarrogate (November)\n\n  East Midlands\nLeicester \u2013 Cavendish Road (May)\nEastern England\nSt Albans (September)\nIpswich \u2013 Felixstowe Road (September)\nWest Midlands\nBirmingham \u2013 Great Hampton (April)\nCoventry \u2013 Walsgrave Road (April)\nPershore (May)\nCannock (September)\nRugby (September)\nWarwick (September)\nBirmingham \u2013 Stirchley (September)\nLichfield (October)\nStourbridge (October)\nCoventry \u2013 Jubilee Crescent (November)\nLeamington Spa (November)\nSutton Coldfield (November)\nBearwood Road Smethwick (November)\nSouth-west\nMoreton-in-Marsh (May)\nOkehampton (May)\nStroud (June)\nPoole (October)\nSalisbury (October)\nSouth-east\nAbingdon (April)\nBurgess Hill (April)\nSidcup (June)\nAmersham (June)\nGuildford (July)\nAshford (September)\nWoking (September)\nRedhill (October)\nBasingstoke (October)\nWorthing (October)\nFareham (October)\nCowley (November)\nLondon\nElephant and Castle (February)\nHolborn (May)\nFinchley (June)\nBarkingside (September)\nWandsworth (September)\nBayswater (September)\nSt James\u2019s Park (September)\nChingford (November)\nGidea Park (November)\nOld Street (November)\nTwickenham (November)\nPotters Bar (November)\nScotland\nBarrhead (April)\nGlasgow \u2013 Govan (May)\nBishopbriggs (May)\nMilngavie (May)\nDunbar (May)\nPortobello (May)\nJedburgh (May)\nKinross (May)\nTain (June)\nUddingston (June)\nEdinburgh \u2013 Clerk Street (July)\nCarluke (July)\nBrechin (July)\nDumbarton (July)\nClarkston (July)\nEdinburgh \u2013 Morningside (September)\nWishaw (September)",

The fact that she was a woman probably helped her to get the pictures: she could interpose herself in a stomach-turning and dangerous situation of macho violence and its aftermath in a less obtrusive and less inflammatory way.\nHer photographs are like very bad dreams and simply looking for any period of time at dead bodies is a very strange experience. With some of the shots, it is impossible to avoid the weird feeling that they are not really dead, that death can\u2019t look exactly like this, that these people are sleeping, or play-acting \u2013 and doing so in an oddly unconvincing way, in elaborately contorted positions covered in blood.\nIt\u2019s only after a while that you realise that a crime-scene photo, for all that it is shocking and transgressive, is probably the only time that you will look at the image of a real dead body.

Root, the Test captain, is expecting a response.\nRoot said: \u201c[The training camp] gives him an opportunity to get some workload in and keep looking to progress his game. He wants to prove to everyone that he wants to put the work in and develop and get better. This is an opportunity for him to do just that.\n\u201cFor Jonny you look at his talent, what he\u2019s achieved and what he potentially could achieve in Test cricket and you think he\u2019s got the capability to go on and make really big scores and be one of the best players in the world as a batter alone.\u201d\nRoot went on to urge Bairstow to take his opportunity when it arises \u2013 \u201che\u2019s someone that\u2019s very good at doing that when that happens\u201d \u2013 and insisted \u201cyou can\u2019t rule out anything out\u201d as regards this still being behind the stumps.\nThe England captain was speaking after Buttler injured his back in the gym before Friday\u2019s second Test in Hamilton, placing Ollie Pope on standby to deputise behind the stumps. Were such a scenario to unfold in South Africa, Bairstow would clearly be the next in line.\nEd Smith\u2019s selection panel convenes shortly after England return from New Zealand on 5 December, and the prospect of Anderson and Wood both being fit again after respective calf and side injuries creates a bottleneck among the seam-bowling berths.\nSaqib Mahmood and Chris Woakes could be viewed as vulnerable here, although the latter\u2019s stronger all\u2011round game gives him an edge should England decide it is a case of two in, one out. The coaching staff on tour are hugely impressed by Mahmood and he is considered a bright long\u2011term prospect. The decision is not straightforward.\nIn the spin-bowling department Matt Parkinson has been backup to Jack Leach in New Zealand but Root, who left Parkinson limping after smashing a ball into his knee during a net session this week, is still minded to recall Moeen Ali should the all\u2011rounder feel ready for a Test return following a self-imposed break.",

Notre Dame High will continue to welcome children of all faiths and none and children from many different diverse backgrounds. It will continue to make a positive impact on our city\u2019s children for many years to come, and so, like all of Glasgow city council\u2019s schools, represents the very best of Glasgow.\u201d\nWhile the majority of single-sex state schools in Scotland closed or were amalgamated in the 1970s and 80s, this Catholic establishment in the affluent west end of Glasgow, founded by nuns in 1897, continued to educate only girls, who nowadays come from a diverse mix of ethnic backgrounds across the city.\nCoed campaigners argued that the school should be open to local families. Parents currently have the option of a mixed secondary, but on the far side of the catchment area, across busy roads. They pointed to the fact that the school roll was not at capacity as evidence of the waning popularity of single-sex education.\nOther parents, including many current and former pupils, firmly resisted the proposed change, insisting that girls grew in confidence, both intellectually and socially, in a single-sex setting, and also noting that minority ethnic girls were strongly represented in placing requests.\nDescribing the council\u2019s decision as shameful, a parent spokeswoman for the Girls for Notre Dame group said: \u201cThere is no common sense in removing education choice from the many to give to the privileged few who already have some of the best-performing coed secondary schools right on their doorstep.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWith no clear educational benefit for change outlined, an equality impact statement highlighting a negative impact on our ethnic communities, and roll-call numbers predicted to decline, we also fear for the longer-term future of the school once it\u2019s coed.\u201d",

His lawyers argued that the smiley face was a \u201ccommonplace image\u201d and that while the designs were inspired by Nirvana\u2019s 1990s concert T-shirts, his designs did not infringe copyright as they sufficiently deviated from Nirvana\u2019s.\nEarlier this month, a California judge allowed the case to move forward. Jacobs has now responded with a countersuit, arguing that there are \u201cnumerous deficiencies\u201d with the case.\nChief among these alleged deficiencies is that it is not clear who designed the band\u2019s logo. The original Nirvana lawsuit claimed it was designed by late frontman Kurt Cobain \u201cin about 1991\u201d \u2013 it first appeared on a flyer for a release party celebrating the album Nevermind, and would later adorn the band\u2019s T-shirts. But in depositions during the lawsuit, surviving bandmembers Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic admitted they didn\u2019t know who created it.\nJacobs\u2019 suit demands that Nirvana\u2019s copyright claim to the logo be removed, and his company\u2019s legal costs be recovered. Nirvana\u2019s legal team will continue to contest the case \u2013 they have complained that individuals who were more familiar with the copyright registration have not yet been questioned by Jacobs\u2019 lawyers.",

Salazar has since said he will appeal against the ban and no NOP athlete, including Farah, has ever been found to have taken a banned substance.\nThe review will pay particular attention to a 2015 audit, led by UKA\u2019s performance oversight committee, which found there was \u201cno reason\u201d to be concerned about any British athlete or coaches involved with the Oregon Project in the wake of an explosive Panorama investigation into Salazar.\nAt the time many in athletics expressed their concerns about the audit\u2019s lack of scope, given it was not asked to examine the doping claims against Salazar but rather Farah\u2019s training programme with the Nike Oregon Project and the endurance programme within the Oregon Project itself.\nThere were also fears about whether the committee could be seen as a whitewashing exercise, given it was led by former athletes Jason Gardener, Dr Sarah Rowell and Anne Wafula Strike \u2013 all with close ties to UKA \u2013 rather than experienced sports lawyers or investigators.\nAs the Guardian pointed out in 2015, while Usada\u2019s inquiry into Salazar was run by the top American lawyer Bill Bock and the former New York City police detective Victor Burgos, UKA had asked three athletes to jump in at the deep end.\nSteve Magness, whose allegations against Salazar were a key part of Panorama\u2019s documentary, said that he had a 30-40 minute interview which he described as \u201cjust a sham\u201d.\nThe review, which has the potential to heap further embarrassment on crisis-hit UKA, which has lost its chief executive, performance director and chair \u2013 and failed to hit its medal target at the recent world championships \u2013 in the space of 10 months, is expected to be completed in the spring of 2020.\nIt was revealed this month that UKA\u2019s decision to stage last year\u2019s World Cup in London on the same weekend as the Wimbledon finals and football World Cup had cost it close to \u00a32m. On Tuesday UK Sport also warned UKA that it risked a cut in its \u00a327m lottery funding.\nAnnouncing the review, the UK Athletics chair, Chris Clark, said: \u201cThe UKA Board recognises the seriousness of the Usada decision released at the start of October. It has unanimously agreed that an independent review should now be carried out with the aim that findings and recommendations are published in or around spring 2020.\n\u201cWe need to ensure we have a clear way forward that gives us confidence in the integrity of our coaching efforts. If there are lessons to be learnt, we plan to implement any recommendations into a future focused, transparent and accountable way of working.\u201d\nMeanwhile Dr Rowell, the chair of the performance oversight committee in 2015, said she welcomed the announcement. \u201cThere has been much written about what the Oregon Project review looked into, found or concluded in 2015, and I therefore welcome this review as an opportunity to establish the full facts and for those facts to be published for all to see.\u201d\nThe review will also examine UKA\u2019s response to the Fancy Bears leaking of a draft Usada report into Salazar in 2017 and make recommendations about its future governance.\nIt will also investigate whether UKA sought advice from UK Sport, UK Anti-Doping and Usada in 2015 and 2017 respectively \u2013 and, if so, did any of those bodies provide any formal response or guidance.\nIn a statement UKA said Mehrzad had \u201csignificant experience of conducting independent reviews in sport\u201d having been the only legal member of the independent review panel that looked into the climate and culture of the world-class programme in British Cycling.\nMehrzad also chaired an independent review concerning governance issues within the British Equestrian Federation.",

Cummings urged Brexiters to persuade their friends to vote Tory to avoid a hung parliament.\nJones told the Guardian that his research paper about the \u201cresurgence of the regions\u201d was \u201chardly a great endorsement for the last nine and a half years of Conservative-led government\u201d and that he voted remain in 2016, fearing that leaving the EU would \u201cresult in a period of very damaging political chaos for the UK\u201d.\nThough he welcomed Cummings\u2019 endorsement of his work, Jones expressed concern about the damaging consequences of Brexit. \u201cI can\u2019t say that subsequent events have made me think I was wrong on that,\u201d he said.\nThe blogpost by Cummings, who was the architect of the Vote Leave campaign in 2016, railed against a potential Labour-led coalition with the SNP, which he said would \u201ccheat a second referendum with millions of foreign votes\u201d.\nCummings added a PS mention for Jones\u2019s work, writing: \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in ideas about how the new government could really change our economy for the better, making it more productive and fairer, you\u2019ll find this paper interesting. It has many ideas about long-term productivity, science, technology, how to help regions outside the south-east and so on.\u201d\nJones, a professor at Sheffield\u2019s department of physics and astronomy, said: \u201cPost-Brexit we\u2019ll need to stay close to Europe in matters such as scientific cooperation \u2026 and in matters related to nuclear technology. We will need to be a country that welcomes talented people from overseas and provides an attractive destination for overseas investment. It doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s the direction of travel the Conservatives are currently going down.\u201d\nJones was tight-lipped on his voting intention in the election. He disclosed that he had attended a meeting about science funding at No 10 in September after an invitation from Cummings, who had got in touch after reading his blog in June. Cummings fleetingly attended the meeting, Jones recalled, but he had no \u201cone-on-one dialogue with him\u201d.\nJones said: \u201cI think the analysis of the UK\u2019s current economic weaknesses is important. I single out the terrible record of productivity growth since the financial crisis, the consequences of that in terms of flat-lining wages, the role of the weak economy in the fiscal difficulties the government has in balancing the books, (as others have done) and the profound regional disparities in economic performance across the country.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that Cummings shares this analysis. The persistence of these problems, though, is hardly a great endorsement for the last nine and a half years of Conservative-led government.\u201d\nHe called for radical changes in the economy, adding: \u201cI think science and innovation is going to be important for this, and clearly Cummings thinks that too. I also offer some concrete suggestions for how the government needs to be more involved in driving innovation \u2013 especially in the urgent problem we have of decarbonising our energy supply to meet the target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that the Conservative party has signed up to a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas target, but the scale of the measures it proposes are disappointingly timid.\u201d",

The companies have operated separately since they jointly went into administration in 2012.\nTony Wright, joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory, said: \u201cWe have now begun advanced negotiations with Peacocks on a going concern basis and aim to complete a transaction that will maximise returns for creditors, but also provide the best opportunity to keep the retailer open and protect the greatest number of jobs.\nHe said Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s future was still dependent on negotiations between Peacocks and landlords on rents and there remained a risk that the business could cease to trade.\nMore than one landlord told the Guardian that they had been approached about rent-free deals in recent months.\nBonmarch\u00e9\u2019s collapse came after it was taken private by Day\u2019s Dubai-based acquisition vehicle Spectre in August.

        "content": "Victims\u2019 relatives again left to face claims that Liverpool fans contributed to tragedy at 1989 FA Cup semi-final\nFor the Hillsborough families whose 96 loved ones were killed so horrifically at a football match on a sunny spring day in 1989, a 30-year battle for the truth and accountability has culminated in another outcome they find impossible to accept. They fought for 21 years against the first inquest verdict of accidental death in 1991, finally seeing it quashed in 2012. Then in April 2016, the jury at the new inquests determined that the 96 people were unlawfully killed by the gross negligence manslaughter of the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield, to a criminal standard of proof.\nYet now, following a grim, painful trial and retrial at Preston crown court, in which the families accused the judge of not being impartial, the jury at his prosecution has found him not guilty of, in effect, the same offence: gross negligence manslaughter.\nFor Duckenfield, prosecution inevitably followed the inquests, where he admitted in March 2015 that his multiple \u201cprofessional failings\u201d at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 \u201cled to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children\u201d.\nThe inquest jury based its unlawful killing verdict on the clear direction of the coroner, the senior former Court of Appeal judge Sir John Goldring, that they could reach it only if they were satisfied \u201cthat David Duckenfield, the match commander, was responsible for the manslaughter by gross negligence of those 96 people\u201d.\nIt also demolished the toxic case made by the South Yorkshire police after the disaster: to blame the victims, those 24,000 people who had gone to Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough ground to support Liverpool and been plunged into horror at the squalid Leppings Lane end. That campaign of blame was infamously initiated by Duckenfield himself, who falsely blamed Liverpool supporters even as people were dying from the crush in \u201cpens\u201d 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terrace.\nAsked what had happened by the Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Graham Kelly, Duckenfield did not tell the truth: that he had ordered exit gates to be opened to allow a large number of people in quickly and alleviate a crush at the turnstiles. Instead, Duckenfield told Kelly that Liverpool supporters had forced a gate open.\nAt the new inquests, Duckenfield admitted that after exit gate C was opened and more than 2,000 people came in, his own failure to have them directed away from a tunnel, which led to the crowded central pens, caused the lethal crush. He also admitted that he had indeed lied at 3:15pm on the day, then again at a meeting of club directors at about 3:45pm, and that it had been a \u201cterrible lie\u201d.\nQuickly relayed to the BBC at the match and broadcast to the nation at 3:40pm, his lie laid the foundation for years of victim-blaming by police that followed: allegations that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late, drunk, loutish and without tickets, and tried to force their way in.\nThe new inquests jury heard all the evidence over more than two exhaustive years, the longest case ever heard in British legal history. They concluded in their verdicts that the behaviour of those paying spectators looking forward to supporting Kenny Dalglish\u2019s brilliant team did not contribute at all to the disaster.\nYet despite those hard-won legal findings, in Preston the effort began again on behalf of Duckenfield to reverse the inquests\u2019 determinations. Over the many weeks in the gloom of downstairs court number one, Duckenfield\u2019s barrister, Benjamin Myers QC, indignantly denied any failings at all, and even denied that hDuckenfield\u2019s admission of failures on oath four years earlier were really admissions at all, arguing they had been taken \u201cout of context\u201d.\nMyers based a defence mostly on arguing it was \u201cbitterly and deeply unfair\u201d to be prosecuting Duckenfield when other factors were to blame \u2013 including the safety flaws of the Leppings Lane terrace and its vile \u201cpens\u201d, the \u201cdefective\u201d police plan Duckenfield inherited and radios not working properly \u2013 and resurrecting the old allegations against the victims. Myers also criticised other police officers who had worked to Duckenfield\u2019s command, including one, Insp Harry White, whom Duckenfield had explicitly said in his evidence at the inquests he did not blame or criticise.\nThe hole in the heart of these proceedings, the question about the British legal system looming over every miserable day for the families, was why it allows and requires this: established truths, determined by a jury on comprehensive evidence given on oath in front of a senior judge, erased and up for grabs again.\nThe Preston trials were marshalled by Sir Peter Openshaw, a veteran judge of the criminal court circuit in Lancashire. Although the new jury was effectively deciding the same questions about the same disaster, Openshaw gave them the required legal direction that previous findings \u2013 about which they were not informed anyway \u2013 were \u201cquite irrelevant\u201d because \u201cthe rules and procedures were very different to a criminal trial\u201d.\nSo a blank page was presented to a new jury, as if no truths had been accepted over 30 years, through the families\u2019 fight, fury and an infinity of tears. Repeatedly, Myers was on his feet alleging that Liverpool supporters had indeed arrived late; that many were without tickets and many had had a drink; that they pushed, misbehaved, refused to accede to police instructions and tried to cheat their way into the ground.\nIn the adversarial system, a defendant can present any case to a court within the rules as applied by the judge, and it is up to the opponent, here the Crown Prosecution Service, to challenge them. The only evidence that counts is what the two opponents have presented in that courtroom, often in hasty responses.\nThe most glaring example of the departure from established truths this can create came in the first trial, which culminated in a hung jury. The CPS lead barrister, Richard Matthews QC, had decided not to make much of Duckenfield\u2019s lie on the day, except, almost in passing, the bare fact that he said it. This was a legal assessment that bewildered and exasperated the families. In Openshaw\u2019s summing up, the judge suggested to the jury that Duckenfield had not, in fact, lied after all. He said that Duckenfield appeared to have genuinely formed the impression that supporters had forced a gate, and that given the circumstances, it was \u201cnot at all surprising\u201d. The jury was never told that Duckenfield had actually admitted in previous proceedings four years earlier that he had told a terrible lie.\nOn the question of Duckenfield\u2019s experience, there was consideration of large events whose police operations he had commanded, including a Billy Graham rally and a Bruce Springsteen concert at Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane ground. Duckenfield had acknowledged those at the inquests, but explained: \u201cThey were different to the football matches of the time.\u201d\nReferring to that, Openshaw told the jury: \u201cAs [Duckenfield] said, the atmosphere of those events \u2013 and the kind of people attending them \u2013 were very different from those attending a semi-final.\u201d\nMargaret Aspinall, the chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose 18-year-old son, James, was one of the 96 people killed, said family members hearing that were devastated, and considered the summing up \u201cone-sided\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cI found it disgusting. Like the judge was saying my lovely innocent son and all our 96 were a different kind of people, hooligans, and their families. Even in death, after 30 years.\u201d\nIn heated meetings over the summer, many family members called on the CPS to improve their performance, and to apply for the judge to be replaced. The CPS did strengthen their case somewhat, including by emphatically presenting Duckenfield\u2019s lie in evidence this time. But Matthews still left out large areas that had been considered by the inquests jury, crucially including whether other police officers\u2019 1989 evidence was reliable. He declined to challenge Openshaw continuing as the trial judge.\nWhen the retrial began on 7 October, Openshaw was in his position again, on the raised, wood-panelled stage. Duckenfield was in the courtroom, not in the dock allocated for criminal defendants; the judge allowed this throughout, explaining in a ruling that it was part of making allowances for Duckenfield\u2019s post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.\nOn October 24, the judge told the jury in some detail that Duckenfield had reported poorly with a chest infection, including that he had driven himself to hospital although he had been told to call an ambulance as a precaution. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, poor chap,\u201d Openshaw said.\nThat was followed by a direction to the jury that if they thought Duckenfield was not showing any emotion as they heard about the horrific crush, and as bereaved parents gave evidence about the loss of their children, it could be explained due to him suffering from PTSD.\nThe families, who have suffered endless grief and trauma for 30 years, reacted with dismay to these interventions, and asked if an accused in a criminal trial would normally be referred to as \u201cpoor chap\u201d.\nIn his summing up of the evidence, Openshaw made a similar reference to the Bruce Springsteen concert and Billy Graham rally, telling the jury that Duckenfield had said of them at the inquests: \u201cThe nature and tone of the events \u2013 and indeed the people who attended \u2013 was completely different from a semi-final.\u201d\nHe did take the jury through Duckenfield\u2019s admissions at the inquests, but added that Duckenfield had \u201cprefaced\u201d many of them by saying he was conceding to failures only with the benefit of hindsight. He did not explain to the jury that the inquests barristers had sought to break that down, asking Duckenfield if he accepted that he failed according to how competent he should have been at the time.\nOpenshaw cited Myers\u2019 argument that the admissions had been \u201cwrung out\u201d of Duckenfield over six days of questioning. But the judge did not explain that many of Duckenfield\u2019s acknowledgements of failure were in fact made on the first two days, to Christina Lambert QC, counsel to the inquests. Nor that Duckenfield\u2019s acceptance that his own \u201cprofessional failings led to the deaths of 96 innocent men, women and children\u201d was made to his own barrister, John Beggs QC.\nThroughout, the jury was told to remove emotion from their consideration, and very little was heard of the 96 people themselves, whose terrible deaths Duckenfield was accused of causing. Aged from 10 to 67; sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, 25 fathers, one mother; at the inquests their lives and personalities had been remembered by their families with loving, vivid personal statements. In Preston the jury was told almost nothing about them, beyond their names being read out at the beginning.\nThe families suffered their catastrophic loss while also having to fight their way through the justice system against the lies, for the truth about how the 96 were killed that terrible day. At the second inquests, they were granted exceptional funding by Theresa May\u2019s Home Office, so for the only time had an army of their own lawyers who battled their way to vindication.\nHere they were in the hands of the legal establishment, watching a stripped-down framing of another new set of truths, as if nothing had ever been decided or admitted before, in 30 years.",

        "content": "180 The Strand, London With its hi-tech recordings of African wildlife, a chamber of mirrors and a yellow bikini, this trip through hypnotically weird worlds is strangely soothing \u2013 but wrap up warm\nI\u2019m sitting on a beanbag in a dark room, staring at a split-screen scored with apple-green blips and streaks of light that \u2013 much like a heart monitor \u2013 record signs of life. The date: 8 September 1994. The setting: Dzanga-Sangha national park, a marshy patch in the Central African Republic. The opening notes come courtesy of a chorus of insects, whose murmurs are soon joined by the territorial shrieks of a southern tree hyrax and the grunts of a western lowland gorilla. The cacophony builds to a climax, and \u2013 the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for \u2013 a solo rumble of African forest elephants, sloshing through water (it\u2019s the wet season). Next, the ribbits of frogs and the chirps of a red-chested cuckoo, then the alarm calls of the greater spot-nosed monkey. The performance continues in much the same vein, animal species sounding both uncomfortably close and disappointingly far away, until \u2013 at last \u2013 it fades and the apple-green blips and streaks vanish from the screen.\nThe Great Animal Orchestra is the highlight of Other Spaces, three audiovisual installations by multidisciplinary collective United Visual Artists. Its conductor is ecologist Bernie Krause, who since the 1970s has been making sound recordings of various ecosystems and their residents. As well as works of art, these soundscapes are a vital means of observing shifts in the world\u2019s remaining wild habitats. Krause archives them, we\u2019re told, in case any of the animal ensembles fall silent \u2013 which, because of human activities, has so far happened in 50% of those in his collection.\nThe first installation, Our Time, explores the way we interact with space \u2013 and, by extension, the world around us \u2013 up close. A row of lightbulbs suspended from the ceiling swing side to side, front to back, in sync and not. A shoddy hypnotist\u2019s pendulum, perhaps, but stand in the centre of the room and you\u2019ll soon find yourself swaying in time to both the kinetic sculptures and Mira Calix\u2019s electronic soundtrack.\nVanishing Point, the third installation, takes this exploration a step further \u2013 forcing us to reckon with a space manipulated by an invisible other. Inspired by the mathematical drawings of Renaissance artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, the laser installation uses perspective as a restructuring mechanism. A small, dark room is sliced and diced by beams of bright-white light projected from an unknown vanishing point. The thread-like rays may look delicate, but there\u2019s something menacing about the way they course across your body.\nRunning in conjunction with Other Spaces is a group show of new work by artists curated by Jefferson Hack. Transformer: A Rebirth of Wonder invites us to dip down beneath 180 The Strand into the basement, to visit a series of created environments by newly commissioned and debut artists.\nDoug Aitken\u2019s video installation New Era explores the invention of the mobile phone and the way it has loosened our grip on reality. Inside a hexagonal chamber of mirrors, screens and speakers, we\u2019re introduced to US engineer Martin Cooper \u2013 the now 90-year-old who led the team that built the first mobile phone \u2013 who declares, repeatedly: \u201cI made a phone call.\u201d A kaleidoscope of sweeping landscapes, manmade highways and myriad communication systems reflects our immersive relationship with handheld devices and the hyperconnected age in which we live.\nA similar temporal and spatial dislocation occurs in Lawrence Lek\u2019s Temple Ost, which uses CGI and 3D animation to connect the building with nearby Temple tube station. Virtual partygoers parade from the underground station to the cavernous space beneath the creative hub for a night out. Elsewhere, Korakrit Arunanondchai gives us a glimpse of Thai folklore and culture with a trio of videos that weave shots of his grandparents, nature, Thai and American protesters, and computer hard drives. And Jenn Nkiru\u2019s Rebirth is Necessary \u2013 a rhythmic film with roots in Afro-surrealism \u2013 splices new and archival footage and recordings to create a dialogue between past and present expressions of black identity.\nThe final work is a collaboration between artists Sophia Al-Maria and Victoria Sin. The first of two encounters sees a female figure wearing a yellow bikini, coat and sandals telling us \u2013 rather forcefully \u2013 to breathe. Sounds simple, but the effect is strangely soothing. Speaking of which, you could spend hours in these free, otherworldly exhibitions, soaking up the sounds, sights and scents. Just remember to wrap up \u2013 it\u2019s cold, especially in the basement.\n Other Spaces and Transformer: A Rebirth of Wonder are at 180 The Strand, London, until 8 December.",

        "content": "Carlos Luis Malatto accused of murders and forced disappearances during Videla dictatorship\nA key witness has testified in the Italian trial of a former Argentinian army officer accused of murders and forced disappearances during Argentina\u2019s 1976-83 military dictatorship.\nAlberto Rivas, 69, flew from Buenos Aires to Rome to give evidence about dozens of kidnappings and incidents of torture and at least two murders allegedly ordered by the former Lt Col Carlos Luis Malatto, who is wanted by the Argentinian authorities and stands accused of five counts of crimes against humanity.\nSince he fled Argentina in 2011, Malatto has been living as a free man in Italy. In 2014 Italy refused Argentina\u2019s request to extradite him, but the following year the justice ministry approved his trial in Rome for the murders of Juan Carlos C\u00e1mpora, the rector of the University of San Juan; Angel Jos\u00e9 Alberto Carvajal, a communist party official; Jorge Bonil, a soldier; and Marie Anne Erize, a French-Argentinian model. Malatto maintains his innocence.\nErize was an activist and adherent to the Peronist movement, Monteneros, which opposed the military dictatorship of Jorge Videla. She was kidnapped on 15 October 1976 by three men in front of a bicycle shop and there has been no trace of her since.\nMore than 40 years later, Rivas has decided to reveal the alleged details of that kidnapping. \u201cMy bicycle was broken that day, but as soon as I entered the workshop, some men ordered me to lie down on the ground,\u201d Rivas told the Guardian. \u201cThey had just blocked a woman, a French girl, and were dragging her outside. There was a blond man, bald, who was with them. He was the leader of these men and they called him Lieutenant Malatto.\u201d\nAbout two weeks later, on 30 October 1976, Rivas was arrested for theft and taken to the Chimbas prison, in the province of San Juan, where political prisoners of the Videla military regime were locked up. \u201cThey put me to work in the garden, near the entrance to the prison,\u201d said Rivas, who landed in Palermo on Friday to hold a press conference about the case. \u201cGeneral Jorge Olivera \u2013 sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity \u2013 used to come in and out of the prison. Olivera was always with Malatto and bragged about raping the French model.\u201d\nRivas said he also witnessed the murder of Angel Jos\u00e9 Alberto Carvajal. Carvajal had been kidnapped on 29 July 1977 and taken to prison. He died in Chimbas on 18 August 1977. The authorities said he killed himself, but murder has always been suspected.\n\u201cI saw the lifeless body of Carvajal being dragged by two soldiers,\u201d said Rivas. \u201cThey raised the corpse to his knees and attached a rope to his neck. Then they made everyone believe he had committed suicide. But they killed him.\u201d\nAfter the 1976 coup, Argentina\u2019s military set about systematically crushing any potential opposition and eventually murdered 30,000 people, almost all of them unarmed non-combatants. Pregnant prisoners were kept alive until they gave birth. Five hundred babies are believed to have been given to childless military couples to raise as their own.\nAmong the tasks assigned to Rivas in Chimbas prison was cleaning the torture room. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the walls and floor of that cell, stained with the blood of hundreds of tortured innocents,\u201d Rivas said.\nHe said he had decided to testify after 40 years because he had \u201crealised later how important the truth was for the family of the desaparecidos [disappeared] seeking justice for their mothers, children, fathers and brothers.\u201d\nRivas lived for two years under police escort. Eight shots were fired at his window in 2014 after he decided to collaborate with Argentinian prosecutors.\nLast June, reporters from the Italian newspaper la Repubblica discovered Malatto in a tourist resort enjoying holidays in the province of Messina, even though he was on trial in Rome.\n\u2018\u2019We asked the Italian judiciary to monitor Malatto\u2019s movements,\u201d said Jorge Ithurburu, a lawyer for 24 Marzo, a Rome-based NGO. \u201cWe fear that he may escape justice.\u201d\nEva Lerouc, 45, whose parents were kidnapped in 1976 by the regime, also testified before prosecutors on Thursday. Her father, Armando Lerouc, was killed and her mother, Elida Saroff, disappeared after the kidnapping. \u201cThis is unfair,\u201d she said of the trial. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight because Malatto has to be extradited. We seek justice.\u201d\nIn 1985, two years after Argentina returned to democracy, the coup\u2019s leader Videla was convicted of human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. Since then, more than 1,000 other former officers have been sentenced for the torture and extrajudicial murder of activists and political opponents and their families.\nMany former officers continue to live in hiding in Europe, especially in Italy where many Argentinians have family ties. Malatto\u2019s family originally hailed from Abruzzo and he holds an Italian passport.\nLast July an Italian court sentenced 24 people to life in prison for their involvement in Operation Condor, in which the dictatorships of six South American countries conspired to kidnap and assassinate political opponents in each other\u2019s territories.",

Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Constance Markievicz won a seat in 1918 but, in line with the party\u2019s abstentionist stance, did not take her seat in the Commons. The Astor statue has also angered many who criticise her as antisemitic, anti-Catholic and a Nazi sympathiser.\nBut focusing on Astor as a brave trailblazer, May said: \u201cWhen Nancy Astor became the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons 100 years ago our country and our democracy was changed for the better.\n\u201cHer arrival in parliament ushered in a new era, finally giving a voice to a huge swathe of the population who for too long had been missing from our politics and our lawmaking. It was the culmination of many generations of campaigning, protest, suffering and struggle.\u201d\nAstor, who stood down in 1945 and died in 1964 aged 84, also had a train named after her, the Nancy Astor Express, which travelled from London to Plymouth for the first time on Thursday. May said she hoped other women would travel from the south-west on it to take up seats in parliament.\nAstor\u2019s relationship with some male MPs was frosty and she is said to have told Winston Churchill: \u201cIf I were your wife I\u2019d give you poison in your coffee,\u201d to which Churchill supposedly replied: \u201cIf you were my wife, I\u2019d drink it.\u201d\nOn the frequently asked questions page of the statue campaign site, Astor scholar and keeper of the Astor archive Jacqui Turner addresses the question of whether the late MP was antisemitic, anti-Catholic and a Nazi sympathiser.\nTurner, of Reading University, says: \u201cThe most controversial thing about Nancy Astor was the fact that she was a woman \u2026 Astor needs to be considered in the context of the period in which she lived, she made unpalatable statements in the heightened atmosphere of the years before world war two. Many male MPs escape such similar censure, Astor herself felt that it was because of her gender she was pilloried in this way.\u201d\nLisa Berry-Waite, of Exeter University, who is researching the careers of the first women to stand for parliament, said: \u201cNancy Astor\u2019s election success in the 1919 Plymouth Sutton byelection made headlines around the world and represented a new era for British politics. Parliament was no longer a male-only space and for the first time a woman was able to directly influence legislation.\u201d",

The hills were a melting pot of youngsters and he benefited from the opportunities the community opened up for him. From humble beginnings, he progressed to teaching and research and had a distinguished academic career in vision sciences and neurophysiology.\nBorn in Bradford, Nev was the second of three children of William, a town-hall clerk, and his wife, Ella, and went to Thornton grammar school. He left at 16, and, with an interest in science, decided to qualify as an optician. Unable to afford a full-time course, he studied applied optics for six years part-time at Bradford technical college.\nLater, during national service, he worked as an optician at the RAF hospital in Wroughton, Wiltshire, where he so impressed the doctors that they suggested he take up teaching.\nHe began his academic career in 1961, as a lecturer in ophthalmic optics in the physics department of Birmingham College of Advanced Technology, which later became Aston University. There he set up the first master\u2019s course in methods of ophthalmic investigation. His interests ranged widely, from work on the neural representation of visual space, published in Nature in 1977, to research on the retina of diabetics, published 25 years later in the Lancet.\nIn 1993 Nev was made a doctor of science (DSc) and became dean of life sciences at Aston. He then accepted a chair at Cardiff University and a productive period of research followed. He was elected life fellow of the College of Optometrists in 2009.\nHis students described him as an inspirational mentor and \u201can optometric polymath\u201d, making research fun and exciting. Many professors say they owe their careers to Nev\u2019s teaching. I climbed and researched with him and my memories are of his support and friendship, his dedication to family and his impish humour.\nNev continued climbing into his 70s and in 2000, with Harold, celebrated 50 years of new routing, with a first ascent of a climb in north Wales called \u201ctwo against nature\u201d.\nHe spent his last years coping with Parkinson\u2019s disease, supported by his wife, Gillian, whom he had met in 1962 as a young primary school teacher; they were married for 56 years, retiring to Malvern, Worcestershire, a place they both loved. Typically, Nev treated Parkinson\u2019s as a research opportunity, becoming an expert in the disease.\nNev is survived by Gillian, and their children, Alison and Duncan, granchildren, William, Ella, Callum and Tiernan, and his sister, Lynn. Harold died in 2015.",

That could fall by as much as \u00a3200,000 under plans reportedly being shared with shareholders before a new remuneration policy due in February.\nStaley\u2019s pension payments were equivalent to 17% of his total fixed salary in 2018, and under the proposals would fall to about the same level as the 10% paid to other Barclays staff. A Barclays source said pension contributions across the business would rise from 10% to 12.5% of salary.\nThe changes, first reported by the Financial Times, would bring Barclays in line with the other major British banks, which have also faced pressure to stop outsized pension perks in the wake of an updated corporate governance code that said bosses\u2019 pension contributions should be in line with the rest of the workforce.\nLuke Hildyard, who campaigns on executive pay at the High Pay Centre, said the proposed changes were \u201cobviously a positive example of engaged shareholder stewardship\u201d as well as pressure from unions.\n\u201cBringing executive pensions more in line with the wider workforce will be good for employee engagement and will help to rebuild the reputation of the banking industry,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, the banks still spend vast sums of money on a small number of top earners, with wider consequences for shareholders, the pay of lower earning staff and divisions between those at the top and everybody else across society as a whole.\u201d\nLloyds Bank is planning similar changes to the pension payments to its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters \u2013 who labelled an investor rebellion against his pay \u201cimmature and unhelpful\u201d \u2013 will also receive half the previous \u00a3474,000 allowance.\nIn 2018 Barclays paid Staley \u00a33.36m in total, 96 times more than the median Barclays employee. That included fixed pay of \u00a32.35m in cash and shares, and he was also awarded a bonus of \u00a31.06m, just under half the maximum possible.\nOn top of that he was given taxable benefits worth \u00a355,000 \u2013 alone nearly double the UK\u2019s median salary of about \u00a329,600. Barclays\u2019 annual report listed those benefits as private medical cover, life and ill health income protection, tax advice, money for relocation and money for a car allowance.\nStaley can also avail himself of a chauffeur-driven company car for business trips, as well as other unnamed benefits that \u201care considered minor in nature\u201d.\nIn 2018 Staley was required to hand over more than \u00a31.1m out of his own pocket as punishment for attempting to unmask a whistleblower. He was fined a total of \u00a3642,430 by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Barclays clawed back \u00a3500,000 of his bonus over the matter.",

The man who has been Wales\u2019s head coach for the last 12 years until three weeks ago will have to locate the management box for the away side as he says farewell to the Cardiff faithful in a Barbarians\u2019 jacket and tie.\n\u201cI have no idea where the away box is,\u201d Gatland said after announcing the invitation club\u2019s side for the uncapped match against a Wales team that is being coached by his successor, Wayne Pivac, for the first time and includes 16 players who were involved in the World Cup campaign in Japan. \u201cSomeone will have to show me so that I do not get lost.\u201d\nThe match, which clashes with a Pro14 weekend, was intended to be Gatland\u2019s final one in charge of Wales, a celebration of the country\u2019s most successful coach. He talked the Welsh Rugby Union into making it Pivac\u2019s debut and asked the Barbarians if there was any chance he could oversee their preparations.\n\u201cI did not think it was right for it to be my last match with Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cI was finished after the World Cup and it was a great chance for the new coaching team to come in and get some time with the players to help them build for the Six Nations. I thought that was really important and so rather than the Barbarians asking me I had to ask them if I could please coach them against Wales so that I was involved.\n\u201cI have enjoyed this week, working with players and coaches for the first time, and it is an opportunity for me to say thank you to the Welsh fans and public for 12 brilliant, amazing years. The place has grown on me and I do not think I can lose either way on Saturday, but we are here to play some rugby and give a good performance. The competitive side is coming out of me now and it is about getting ourselves right and winning.\u201d\nGatland knows where the away dressing room is, although he will have to remember to turn right at the top of the stairs rather than the familiar left, because when he arrived in Wales at the end of 2007 it was where the home team used to change.\n\u201cEven though it was a bit bigger than the away changing room and had a larger warm-up area, I felt the configuration of it was not right. I asked the players if they were prepared to switch and as it had hardly been incredibly successful, they agreed. The change was good for us and it has been a while since we lost at home in a competitive game.\u201d\nIt will probably be for a while longer that Gatland refers to Wales as we and Pivac faces a doubly demanding task: getting a team that is not underpinned by successful professional teams to play at a consistently high standard, as his predecessor did, and following a coach who became an institution.\nGatland said: \u201cI have not been in contact with Wayne. This is his team now and I have stepped back because it is important that he takes the reins. He was at the World Cup for a couple of weeks and had a look. It was funny on Tuesday because I went back to my apartment and drove past when they were training. It felt a bit weird so I made sure I did not look out of the car window and my apartment overlooks the ground. I did not watch them train and felt a bit awkward. It was too dark, anyway. It is an unusual situation on Saturday but one to look forward to. I am sure both sides will want to play.\u201d\nPivac has added Sam Warburton, one of Gatland\u2019s captains, to his management team. \u201cI do not know if he has a bright future because I have not seen him coach,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cSome of the players were there when he was captain and the separation from playing and coaching can be challenging, but people tell me he is pretty excited about it and he has earned a huge amount of respect. I hope he does a good job.\u201d\nWales have included the wing Johnny McNicholl in their starting lineup, with the New Zealander qualifying for Wales through residency. He is one of seven Scarlets, the region coached by Pivac until May, in the side, with an Osprey, Justin Tipuric, the captain.\n\u201cJohnny brings a lot of x-factor and I hope he sees the ball,\u201d Pivac said. \u201cWarren and I being up against each other is a side issue. His are big footsteps to walk in and we want to get as much as we can out of the game. What I want is a no-excuse environment so that you do not blame others.\u201d",

Thanksgiving has increasingly drawn criticism for glossing over the disastrous impact of white settlement on Native Americans.\nSince 1970, the United American Indians of New England organisation has held a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving day, to remember \u201cthe genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture\u201d, according to the Associated Press.\nThe National Day of Mourning takes place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, an early place of European settlement.\nWounded Knee, described by the Washington Post as \u201cone of most shameful and bloody acts of violence against indigenous people in American history\u201d, occurred on 29 December 1890.\nChief Big Foot, who led the Minneconjou Lakota, was guiding his people to refuge in South Dakota when US soldiers stopped them. The group surrendered and was taken to Wounded Knee Creek, \u201csurrounded by 470 soldiers and their formidable artillery\u201d, the Post wrote.\nWhile exact details of the massacre have proved difficult to determine, it is believed there was a dispute while soldiers were trying to disarm the chief\u2019s men. It is also thought a gunshot prompted American forces to attack. Between 150 and 400 Native Americans were killed. Historians agree most of the victims were women and children.\nTwenty members of the 7th cavalry involved in Wounded Knee received the Medal of Honor, which is described by the Army as \u201cthe nation\u2019s highest medal for valor in combat that can be awarded to members of the armed forces\u201d.\nA large number of the medals were awarded for \u201cgallantry\u201d and \u201cbravery\u201d even though there are few details of purported acts of heroism, the Post noted.\nMaj Gen Nelson A Miles, an army commander, wrote of the incident: \u201cI have never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre than that at Wounded Knee.\u201d\nAccording to a letter cited by the Post, Miles described the victims as \u201cwomen with little children on their backs, and small children powder-burned by the men who killed them being so near as to burn the flesh and clothing with the powder of their guns, and nursing babies with five bullet holes through them\u201d.\nWhile the Medal of Honor was granted more loosely in the 19th century, scholars have noted that the number of Wounded Knee recipients is high. Antietam, an 1862 civil war battle considered the \u201cbloodiest day in US history\u201d, also led to 20 awards.\nNative Americans have long pushed for the revocation of medals awarded to Wounded Knee soldiers. Since 1997, the National Congress of American Indians has greenlighted resolutions requesting the removal of medals.\nCongress formally apologized in 1990, stating \u201cdeep regret on behalf of the United States to the descendants of the victims and survivors and their respective tribal communities\u201d. But, the Associated Press reported, lawmakers did not offer any type of reparations.",

        "content": "The late film star was a trailblazer for diversity in fashion and film. His loss deprives the growing Chinese entertainment industry of a fine talent\nTaiwanese-Canadian actor Godfrey Gao was famous for being the first Asian international supermodel but he was much more than just a pretty face \u2013 he had a reputation for being one of the friendliest stars in an intensely competitive industry.\n\u201cHe was known for being a very nice guy,\u201d says Cecilia Pidgeon, a former celebrity editor at GQ China. \u201cHe had a very good reputation among other actors. He was always nice to his fans. All of the colleagues he worked with only had good things to say.\u201d\nHis shocking death at the age of 35 yesterday from a heart attack on the set of the reality TV show Chase Me cut short a career that included a role in 2013 as Magnus Bane in the Hollywood adaption of The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.\nBorn Tsao Chih-hsiang in Taipei, Taiwan, Gao moved to Vancouver in Canada as a child and became the first Asian model to star in a Louis Vuitton campaign in 2011.\nAfter returning to his home country in 2004, he became part of a new generation of actors, who were born in Asia and moved back to establish their careers after emigrating abroad with their families. Along with Gao, Shawn Dou, a Chinese-Canadian actor who was born in Xi\u2019an, and Eddie Peng, a Taiwanese-Canadian actor and singer from Penghu, have also achieved fame by returning to Asia.\n\u201cBecause of the success of the mainland Chinese film industry, they all decided to go back to Asia to start their career there,\u201d says Dr Ruby Cheung, lecturer in film studies at Southampton University. \u201cFor Chinese, Taiwan or Hong Kong-born actors who have emigrated, there are more opportunities there for them to become really big. If they started out in Hollywood, they would have to work extremely hard to achieve the same level of stardom.\u201d\nGao started acting in Chinese TV shows in 2006, but his most popular role came in Remembering Lichuan, a romantic drama that aired in 2016. By then he had already moved into films with roles in Chinese blockbuster Shanghai Fortress and as the character of Ken in Toy Story 3 for the Mandarin dub.\nTransitioning from TV to film is a traditional route for most Asian actors. Chinese superstar Fan Bingbing, Red Cliff\u2019s Vicki Zhao and Liu Yifei, who will take the lead in the upcoming live action adaptation of Disney\u2019s Mulan, all became massive stars in China this way.\nIt\u2019s also very common for the Asian acting world to look to the modelling industry for new talent. Hu Bing, who was nominated for best actor at the 2010 Rome film festival, is one of China\u2019s most famous models, while Taiwanese star Lin Chi-ling also started out on the runway.\nBut in the past few years, reality TV shows have emerged as one of the easiest ways to gain instant stardom. I Am a Singer, The Rap of China, Idol Producer and The Voice of China are all wildly popular and have produced overnight sensations. Then there\u2019s Chase Me, the competitive sports challenge show broadcast on China\u2019s Zhejiang Television, that Gao agreed to guest star on.\nThe actor is reported to have collapsed while on Chase Me\u2019s set in Ningbo, China, after working for 17 hours straight. According to Pidgeon, long working hours are extremely common in the Chinese TV and film industry. \u201cIt\u2019s normal because it\u2019s a very competitive industry. You can get famous very quickly. So everyone works extra hours to finish a show fast. All these actors make a lot of money but actually they work really hard. Working overnight is normal.\u201d\nChina, of course, is now becoming a major player in Hollywood too, with an increasing amount of investment from Chinese companies. This means there\u2019s potential for more crossover artists like Gao, who appeared alongside Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones.\nThe actor was not just a rising star with a career that was likely to take him to giddier heights but also a trailblazer for diversity and Asian representation in US movies. It\u2019s a real tragedy that such talent was brought back to earth so cruelly.",

The proportion of primary school trainees was close to the DfE\u2019s target at 96%.\nUnion leaders said the shortages were becoming more acute as children from a recent mini baby boom progressed from primary to secondary school.\nKevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cPupil numbers in state-funded secondary schools have already risen by almost 150,000 since 2014 and will rise by a further third of a million pupils over the next five years.\n\u201cEven where trainee targets have been met, recruitment to initial teacher training courses is just the very start. New teachers need dedicated support to help them develop into competent professionals. Once we have invested in their skills, we must not lose their passion and experience.\u201d\nCourtney said the government was still failing to account for past under-recruitment and not doing enough to prevent teachers from leaving the profession, with around a third of new recruits leaving within five years.\nThe DfE\u2019s own forecasts suggest a nearly 15% rise in the secondary school population by 2027, adding around 400,000 pupils in state secondary schools in England.\nSuccessive governments have struggled to attract and retain teachers with computing, maths and physics degrees because of high demand in the wider workforce. In the case of modern foreign languages, the DfE said the shortfall was partly due to setting a higher recruitment target this year.\nThe government had previously announced efforts to raise teacher starting salaries to \u00a330,000 as part of a recruitment and retention strategy designed to maintain the workforce in England.\nAngela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the repeated missed targets showed the Conservatives could not be trusted to meet their own forecasts in government.\n\u201cThey have no plan to deal with the crisis they have created in teacher recruitment and retention, and their spending pledge amounts to a 13-year real-terms freeze, meaning four in five state schools in England will be financially worse off next year,\u201d Rayner said.",

In a way we did have our happy ending.\n\u201cI loved him. He was a lovely man and we just suited each other. I will miss the companionship and the laughter. He could be such good fun.\u201d\nAfter watching Selway combing the bins near her shop in Gloucester, Neininger, who was married at the time, started to leave wrapped sandwiches for him. \u201cI knew straight away that Ken was a lovely man with a beautiful soul,\u201d she said. \u201cThe man haunted me like a spectre.\u201d\nNeininger researched homelessness and began to try to help Selway. He would not take money but eventually he was persuaded to join Neininger and her then husband, Norman, for a meal.\nSelway told them he had been born in London and evacuated to Wales where he became a Bevin Boy, a young man conscripted to work in the coalmines during the second world war. He developed mental health issues and found his way to Gloucester.\nOver the next few years, Selway drifted in and out of the lives of Neininger and her husband. At one point, Norman issued an ultimatum and his wife moved out into a caravan that Selway would come to stay in, though their relationship remained celibate.\nNeininger became a mental health campaigner and published a book about Selway called Portrait of Ken. The three \u2013 husband and wife, plus Selway \u2013 found a way of getting along.\nAfter Norman died, Selway developed health problems and moved into a supported housing complex in the Forest of Dean, where he was later joined by Neininger.\nNeininger said their story should be a reminder not to dismiss people living on the streets, and to provide more help for those with mental health problems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing, mental illness, but the right medication can make all the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a massive issue and we cannot just keep turning a blind eye to homelessness.\u201d\nSelway\u2019s funeral will take place on Friday at Gloucester crematorium, followed by a gathering at a rugby club.",

It showed that only 4% of the UK\u2019s potential shale projects were likely to go ahead, contradicting public claims that a shale revolution could spur \u00a333bn of investment and create more than 64,000 jobs.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what further revelations are in the report they\u2019re still hiding, but the government are clearly very keen that the public don\u2019t find out, which makes it all the more important that we do,\u201d Parr said.\nAs part of its ruling, the information tribunal said it had noted \u201can unfortunate tendency\u201d on the part of the Cabinet Office to be content to release positive information about the fracking industry but \u201canxious to withhold more negative information\u201d.\n\u201cIt is no secret that the government supported the development of the industry and the report was designed to address how the government could help it to develop; it was in our view in the public interest that the public should know how far officials were suggesting government might go in doing so,\u201d it said.\nIt is understood the Cabinet Office will comply with the ruling in due course. It declined to comment on the reason behind the delay.\nBoris Johnson snubbed the leaders\u2019 debate on the climate, which was due to take place on Thursday evening.",

        "content": "People like Gwyneth Pendry (Reasons to be hopeful that Labour can come out on top, Letters, 25 November) take encouragement from comparing Labour under Clement Attlee nearly 75 years ago with Labour under Jeremy Corbyn now. John Bew\u2019s biography of Attlee, Citizen Clem, published in 2016, establishes two highly relevant, and sadly inconvenient, differences: Corbyn is not remotely any kind of reincarnation of the Attlee who emerges from Bew\u2019s 560 pages; and the world in which Attlee triumphed only very remotely resembles our political world today.\nIn 1945 Britain was just emerging from six years of war in which many voters had witnessed severe destruction and suffered the loss of people close to them. This was a serious time, and a serious nation: not one in which a morally dubious, careless, flippant, cynical operator like Boris Johnson today could have been taken seriously.\nIn the circumstances of war, both Churchill and Attlee had earned the respect of most British people. The attitude surveys in today\u2019s opinion polls, often far more telling than what gets into the headlines, provide another inescapable indication of the way in which politicians, and politics generally, operate in a vastly different context from that of 1945. In this less committed, less deferential, more disillusioned world, they have ceased to command respect; Corbyn, however unjustly, more so even than Johnson.David McKieBearsted, Kent\n As Francis Fukuyama has painfully learned, a dogmatic belief in historical inevitability is a dangerous foundation when analysing the political world. Rather than asking whether the \u201cnew left is yet capable of winning power\u201d (Can the radical left win power? This matters beyond Britain, 28 November), Aditya Chakrabortty might more usefully take a cold shower, look at polling data and ponder why a newly radicalised Labour party appears to be heading for its greatest defeat since 1983 against such a poorly performing incumbent, and even whether the lack of broad electoral appeal of the Corbyn project is not giving licence to the Conservatives to veer further to the right than they might have done against a more credible opponent. But then again, that might only lead him to conclude, as Brecht did, that the people have lost the confidence of the party. Jan KamienieckiLondon\n I\u2019ve known Jeremy Corbyn since he was a young Haringey councillor in the 1970s. I was sceptical then of his idea that significant societal change could come through the Labour party and parliament. I thought that more would be required in terms of extra-parliamentary activity and pressure as a start and still do. The two of course are far from being in opposition, and Corbyn himself has an impressive track record as a campaigner, notably against racism.\nJeremy Corbyn has kept at his strategy and, as Aditya Chakrabortty notes, has recruited to the Labour cause thousands who were involved initially in the politics of protest. If Labour wins on 12 December it will be a significant marker in that debate from the 1970s about whether the Labour leader was right about how to change the world, or whether we had a point about the difficulty of reforming capitalism bit by bit.\nI hope I\u2019m proved wrong after the best part of 50 years, but stand ready to continue the fight for a better world whatever the outcome.Keith FlettLondon \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "In a world increasingly populated by charlatans and idiots, we have just lost two outstanding intelligent, funny and talented individuals in one day \u2013 Jonathan Miller and Clive James (Obituaries, 28 November).\nAlthough quite different in many respects, both contributed in intellect and humour in ways we so desperately need right now. Both are irreplaceable, whereas our television screens and newspapers are now full of people whose disappearance would be no loss if they were to vanish tomorrow.\nMiller\u2019s description of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 1980s Britain could be, word for word, an apt description of both Theresa May\u2019s and Boris Johnson\u2019s tenure in Downing Street. As we face a dreadful world of Brexit and Trump, more than ever, where are others like them?Garth GroombridgeSouthampton\n The highlight of my design career was having the good fortune to work with Jonathan Miller, designing his book that accompanied the National Gallery exhibition On Reflection in 1998. Jonathan was oddly lacking in self-esteem and would ask us endlessly \u201cDo you think this is all right?\u201d, to which the answer was inevitably \u201cJonathan, it\u2019s wonderful\u201d. His question \u201cIt\u2019s rather good, don\u2019t you think?\u201d became the publisher\u2019s and my catchphrase for the project. He was rather good in so, so many ways.Chlo\u00eb AlexanderLudlow, Shropshire\n The one quote from Clive James that I shall always remember dates from the time he was the Observer\u2019s TV critic. A week after Mrs Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979, he began his column with the words \u201cNow that the incoming Tory Government has made greed patriotic...\u201d Not much has changed in the past 40 years.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincolnshire\n Clive James\u2019s TV reviews for the Observer were so funny. He once described the formidable dog and horse trainer Barbara Woodhouse, whose techniques included breathing up the horse\u2019s nostrils. \u201cAfter that, the beast will do her bidding, and so would you.\u201dPeter LowthianMarlow, Buckinghamshire\n Not only was Clive James a remarkable writer, he was also extraordinarily self-deprecating. When I helped run the Oxford University Literary Society when he was at the height of his fame he offered to speak for us and waived his fee, because, in his words, \u201cI am embarrassed by how abysmal I was last time I spoke at the university.\u201dSteven PollardPertenhall, Bedfordshire\n So sad to hear that Clive James has died \u2013 he had cheated death for so long that it seemed he would last for ever. Too much to hope for, of course, but we have an amazing body of work to remember him by, including some of the most moving poetry I have ever read.Cherry WestonWolverhampton\n I will always be grateful to Jonathan Miller for one thing. He once defended the piles of unread books in his home by explaining that he absorbed the contents \u201cby osmosis\u201d. That\u2019s the perfect excuse for me to buy more books, so thank you, Jonathan.Giles OakleyEast Sheen, London\n Jonathan Miller was a brilliant man who, when interviewed many years ago, memorably described himself: \u201cI\u2019m not really a Jew; just Jew-ish, not the whole hog.\u201dPeter NegriAlpington, Norfolk\n Clive James wrote: \u201cHemingway was always killing something.

        "content": "Catch up with the campaign with our daily roundup\nJeremy Corbyn has sought to play down reports that Labour is going to switch to fighting a more defensive campaign, putting more stress on policies that might appeal to leave voters. News of the change of tack emerged after the publication of the most-eagerly awaited poll of the campaign, a YouGov MRP analysis that suggests Boris Johnson is on course for a majority of 68. Speaking at an event in Southhampton, where he published Labour\u2019s environment manifesto, A Plan for Nature, Corbyn dismissed suggestions that this meant he would now have one message for leave voters, and another for remain voters. He told reporters:\nOur campaign is in every part of the country. I am travelling all around the country. I say the same thing at every place I go. I don\u2019t have one message for one group. I say the same message everywhere. Vote Labour in order to get a government that will deal with the inequalities and poverty and injustice austerity has heaped on this country.\nBut the Guardian has been told that Labour is planning to change its approach, and having pursued a relatively offensive strategy (focusing on Tory-held seats), it now plans to concentrate more on shoring up the Labour vote in constituencies the party already holds. There have been reports saying that the party\u2019s private polling shows it is vulnerable in leave seats but \u2013 as ever \u2013 private polling mostly replicates the results of polling that gets released to the public, and the YouGov survey highlighted this exact point. Here is an extract form the write-up from YouGov\u2019s Anthony Wells:\nIf the election were held today we project that the Tories would win 359 seats (a gain of 42 from 2017), Labour would win 211 (down by 51), the SNP 43 (up eight) and the Liberal Democrats 13 (a gain of one). Plaid Cymru would retain their four seats, the Greens would keep their single seat, and the Brexit party would not take any seats at all.\nAs it stands, the swing to the Conservative party is bigger in areas that voted to leave in 2016, with the bulk of the projected Tory gains coming in the north and the urban West Midlands, as well as former mining seats in the East Midlands.\nAt this point in the campaign, the Liberal Democrats have not made any real breakthrough \u2013 with our current projections showing that while they would pick up four seats they would lose three elsewhere.\nThe survey has acquired near-gospel status in the Westminster political system because in 2017 the YouGov MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) model (explained here, if you are interested) was about the one polling exercise that predicted a hung parliament. Perhaps this one will turn out to be accurate too, but there is no guarantee of that, and of course the campaign has another fortnight to run.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has attacked the spending plans of the UK\u2019s two main parties, saying neither election manifesto \u201cis a properly credible prospectus\u201d. As my colleague Larry Elliott explains in his analysis of the IFS verdict, its judgment was \u201cbrutal and even-handed: a plague on both your houses\u201d. There is a summary of what it said about the Tories\u2019 plans here, Labour\u2019s here and the Lib Dems\u2019 here.\nJo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has sought to put Boris Johnson\u2019s character flaws at the heart of the election campaign by using a speech to argue that he is \u201cnot fit to be prime minister\u201d because he is selfish, dishonest and divisive.\nJeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader and S\u00eean Berry, the Green co-leader, have been preparing for a Channel 4 News debate on the environment starting at 7pm. Boris Johnson has refused an invitation to appear, and reportedly Channel 4 is planning to replace him with an ice sculpture that should melt under the glare of the studio lights. There will be full coverage on our live blog.\nConservative candidates in the general election have been issued with a detailed 17-page dossier on how to attack Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals which contains numerous rehashed and potentially misleading claims, the Guardian can reveal. You can read the full dossier embedded in our story here.\nMedics have called for guarantees that health will not be put at risk for profit after Labour released official documents that it said proved the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in trade talks with the US.\nLabour has deselected its candidate for Falkirk over alleged antisemitic posts on Facebook, leaving the party unable to contest a seat it once held for decades.\nAn academic whose research was championed by the prime minister\u2019s key adviser Dominic Cummings has revealed he voted remain in the EU referendum and has hit out at the Conservatives\u2019 Brexit plans.\nSign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s election briefing direct to your email inbox every weekday.\nIf you\u2019re using the Guardian app and would like a daily alert to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s election briefing, click here and select \u201cget notifications\u201d.",

        "content": "Hundreds of jobs lost since National Citizen Service ended contract with The Challenge\nThe National Citizen Service, the \u201cbig society\u201d youth organisation set up by David Cameron, has been accused of a national scandal over claims it effectively forced a charity partner into insolvency, resulting in hundreds of staff losing their jobs.\nThe Challenge, which had provided nearly half of the entire NCS programme under a \u00a370m-a-year contract, announced on Wednesday that it had gone into administration after months of dispute with NCS Trust, which administer the service, over the terms of a new contract to run youth services from April 2020.\nNCS was launched by Cameron in 2010 as \u201ca kind of non-military national service\u201d to encourage youngsters from different backgrounds to integrate and develop life skills. The trust oversees \u00a3181m of public funds aimed at pushing 100,000 16-year-olds a year through its four-week citizenship programme.\nAbout 500 staff have lost their jobs at The Challenge since August when NCS Trust unilaterally cancelled its contract and withheld payments. Administration means most will now no longer receive redundancy payments, although up to 200 may be able to transfer to jobs at new NCS providers.\n\u201cThose charged with oversight of NCS provision have failed many hundreds of dedicated colleagues and jeopardised many thousands of opportunities for young people. It is nothing short of a national scandal,\u201d said Bill Ronald, the chair of The Challenge.\nAn internal email sent to Challenge staff by its chief executive, Oliver Lee, said it had been unable to withstand what amounted to a \u201csystematic assault\u201d by NCS Trust, which he said had \u201cbled us dry\u201d financially and left the charity with no option but to go into administration.\nLee, a former Royal Marine commander with experience in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan, added: \u201cI have worked in some difficult places and circumstances over my career, but none is equal to the manner in which The Challenge has been treated by NCS Trust this year.\u201d\nIt is understood that the dispute centred on NCS Trust\u2019s contractual insistence that The Challenge adopt its new centralised IT operating system, which the latter regarded as inefficient and expensive. The Challenge is understood to have raised the dispute with ministers in July and was told it was not a government problem.\nIn a statement, NCS Trust denied it was responsible for The Challenge entering administration. \u201cThe fact remains The Challenge decided it would not sign contracts to deliver NCS from 2020 and that was the main catalyst for the resulting problems it has faced. To suggest there is a failure of oversight in NCS provision is utter nonsense.\u201d\nThe Challenge denied that it had withdrawn from the contracts but said it had sought assurances about their safety and viability. \u201cThe contracts \u2013 which we had fairly won and been awarded \u2013 were unilaterally withdrawn on 31 July 2019, 16 days after we registered our concerns with DCMS.\u201d\nThe shadow minister for civil society, Vicky Foxcroft, said it was unbelievable that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport had watched The Challenge go into administration without even meeting to discuss its concerns. \u201cDCMS gives NCS \u00a3181m a year. We need to know it has a handle on this,\u201d she said.\nSince 2011, more than 600,000 young people have participated in the NCS programme, which offers a residential course teaching team-building, discipline and resilience as well as involvement in social action projects such as planting communal gardens or arranging family fun days.\nNCS Trust has struggled to prove that the \u00a31bn of public funds spent on the scheme \u2013 at a time when hundreds of millions has been cut from local authority-run youth services as part of austerity programmes introduced under Cameron \u2013 have proved value for money or produced the hoped-for social benefits.\nCameron remains connected to NCS Trust as chair of its board of patrons. Other patrons include a number of peers, businesspeople and media figures including the Today programme editor, Sarah Sands, ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, and the former Times editor James Harding.",

The incident took them both out and while Leclerc accepted he was also at fault he pointedly noted that Vettel knew he had made the move that led to the crash.\nThe drivers were vying for position at Interlagos when Vettel went to pass his teammate. Having drawn just ahead he moved to the left, squeezing Leclerc\u2019s line, who did not give ground and they touched, sustaining damage that eliminated both Ferraris.\nMattia Binotto, the team principal, demanded explanations and both drivers were summoned to Ferrari\u2019s headquarters at Marenello. Speaking about that meeting before this weekend\u2019s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Leclerc suggested Vettel had accepted he had been in the wrong.\n\u201cSeb probably shouldn\u2019t have gone to the left and he knows it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could have done a better job of avoiding him going to the left.\u201d\nFollowing the birth of his third child Vettel was not at the press conference in Abu Dhabi.\nThe relationship between the two has come under increasing pressure recently with both looking to assert themselves in contradiction of team instructions. After the discussion at Ferrari, Leclerc said they would remain able to race one another but they would have to temper their combative instincts.\n\u201cWhat is important is everything is clear now and we move forward. We will be able to race together. We will try to not let it happen again. Seb and myself are very competitive. We both want to win but we need to find the right compromise because we are racing for the same team. We need to be less aggressive and give each other more space.\u201d\nThe 22-year-old Leclerc is in only his second season in F1 but lies fourth in the championship in front of Vettel. He viewed the incident as part of gaining experience. Whether it will make him more inclined to give way when being squeezed is another matter.\n\u201cI particularly looked at it to try to understand how we could have made things better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequences were huge but the impact was very small, so that was a little bit unlucky. It was unfortunate.\u201d\nFerrari favoured Vettel as their No 1 driver at the start of the season but Leclerc\u2019s strong debut for the team has given them a problem.\nHe will almost certainly beat his teammate in the final standings and has a 19-point lead over Vettel going into Sunday\u2019s final grand prix of the season. He can reasonably expect Ferrari to give him at least equality next season but managing that balance may prove difficult.\nBinotto said his drivers have cleared the air and Ferrari were ready to move on. \u201cWe discussed together and I think that they understand what happened was not acceptable,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Charles Michel, who replaces Donald Tusk, says bloc has to work hard to keep unity\nThe EU is ready for the next phase of Brexit but risks greater internal divisions over trade talks with the UK, one of its incoming leaders has said.\nIn one of his first interviews since being nominated president of the European council, Charles Michel said Brexit may have played an important role in bringing the EU together.\nThe former Belgian prime minister will take the reins following a formal handover ceremony on Friday in his Europa HQ in Brussels, as Donald Tusk stands down after five years in post.\nMichel\u2019s first big moment will be chairing the EU summit on 12-13 December \u2013 election time in the UK.\nEU leaders will probably be finishing off their three-course dinner when exit polls drop on polling day, revealing whether Boris Johnson\u2019s election gamble is likely to have paid off.\nMichel said he hoped the election would bring clarity on whether the UK would ratify the withdrawal agreement. If Brexit happens on 31 January, the two sides will immediately embark on an 11-month race to negotiate a free-trade agreement.\n\u201cWe are ready, we know what the most important principles are we want to defend and promote in the next phase,\u201d Michel told the Guardian and six other European newspapers. \u201cWe also know what are the top priorities: the integrity of the single market, the level playing field [fair competition], the Good Friday agreement.\u201d\nThe EU would have to \u201cwork again very hard\u201d to maintain unity, he said, especially as countries had different economic interests in the UK relationship. \u201cThere is a risk to be divided based on different economic situations in different countries. But if we use the same transparent way of working, it is the best guarantee to maintain unity.\u201d\nMichel declined to predict whether the two sides could agree a trade deal in just 11 months. In the annals of trade talks this would be an unprecedented feat and one senior EU diplomat said he could not see it happening \u201cin my wildest dreams\u201d.\nMichel said he wanted to avoid Brexit becoming a big issue for the summit, as he planned to focus on the eurozone, climate change and the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget.\nUnlike Tusk, an unabashed anglophile who recently declared \u201cin my heart I will always be a remainer\u201d, the Belgian leader avoids flamboyant statements. \u201cThere are many things in my heart and certainly I also regret the choice, but I respect the choice of the British citizens.\u201d He added it would be important to \u201cshow serenity\u201d in upcoming talks.\nHis priority is making Europe a more united player on the world stage, as he warned against the possibility of the union becoming \u201cthe collateral damage\u201d in a possible cold war between the US and China. \u201cThere is a risk that in the long term, there is a new cold war between the United States and China \u2026 I don\u2019t think the destiny of Europe is to become a junior partner.\u201d\nMichel said EU leaders needed \u201cmore strategic discussions\u201d, including in dealing with China, before two summits with the country next year.\nUnlike his predecessor, who once listed Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cworrying declarations\u201d as one of the threats facing Europe, Michel struck an emollient note towards the US. He said the EU and US shared \u201cthe same goals\u201d and many common values, although he noted the two were at odds over climate change and the Iran nuclear deal.\nThe softly spoken son of a former Belgian deputy prime minister, who has been involved in politics since his teenage years, Michel has broken many political records. He was Belgium\u2019s youngest-ever minister (aged 24) and youngest-ever prime minister (aged 38) when he formed an unwieldy four-party coalition dominated by Flemish nationalists in 2014. The coalition collapsed in 2018 when Michel insisted on signing a UN migration pact, against the wishes of the larger Flemish nationalist party.\nDescribing himself as a bruggenbouwer (bridge builder), he said his experience in Belgian politics would help him forge compromises among 27 countries. \u201cMany people say Belgium is a mini-Europe,\u201d he said.\nMichel, a liberal ally of Emmanuel Macron, is seen as close to France, but sought to stress he was his own man. He said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was the first EU leader to suggest he consider the European job.\nHe spoke warmly of ideas to reform the EU enlargement process that are closely associated with the French president, who caused uproar by blocking North Macedonia from opening membership talks.\n\u201cWe need to discuss whether it is possible to improve this process, for example with the possibility to decide the principle of reversibility,\u201d said Michel, referring to a key French idea that countries could be pushed to the back of the queue if sliding back on democratic reforms.\nWhile some countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, are sympathetic to the French plans, others in central and eastern European countries are wary.\nMichel will be only the third person to occupy the job, since the post was created in 2009. Some EU member states complain that being Europe\u2019s summiteer-in-chief is only a part-time job, a charge Michel batted away. He said the European council had grown in importance. \u201cI\u2019m not naive, I know what the obstacles are, but I am hopeful. I feel [there is] stronger political will among the leaders \u2013 stronger than is reflected in the media \u2013 to take decisions.\u201d",

        "content": "\u2018I\u2019ve always been free,\u201d Grady Diangana says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re happy and you\u2019re enjoying something, good things will happen to you. You know, I didn\u2019t even know football was a profession. You see the stars on TV and they\u2019re just playing football. You don\u2019t know it\u2019s a job. I just played because I enjoyed it. I had the ambition to be on the screen.\u201d\nThere is a youthful innocence to Diangana, a creative soul who makes the most of his spare time by drawing portraits and making music. The West Ham winger remembers being blown away by Eden Hazard\u2019s quality after being named on the bench for a game against Chelsea in April 2018 and he says he felt no pressure after joining West Bromwich Albion on loan in the summer. Diangana has thrived at the Hawthorns and the move offered him a chance to play the game he has loved since he was a kid. \u201cThat\u2019s all I remember about my childhood. Playing football.\u201d\nThe 21-year-old is quiet and he admits he has grown up since going out on loan. He knows he will have to be disciplined to achieve his ambition of playing for England. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to learn the other side to the game, the duties of the job. When you\u2019re young you just want to enjoy it. I was about 16 when I realised those responsibilities. And it\u2019s a habit now. Whatever I have to do for the team I\u2019ll do.\u201d\nWest Brom, who are top of the Championship before visiting Preston North End on Monday, love what Diangana is doing. He has scored four goals for Slaven Bilic\u2019s side and he sparkled during the 4-1 win against Bristol City on Wednesday, setting up the opening goal for Kieran Gibbs with a sublime backheel.\nDiangana\u2019s form is not a surprise. He scored twice when Manuel Pellegrini gave him his West Ham debut in an 8-0 victory against Macclesfield in the Carabao Cup last season and his early performances were bold and imaginative. He has a lovely left foot and an eye for a pass.\nYet sustaining that promise was hard. Diangana rarely played after Christmas and he found his path into Pellegrini\u2019s side blocked by expensive internationals. \u201cIn preseason I had the ambition to get into the starting XI at West Ham,\u201d Diangana says. \u201cI did my best. Then I had a chat with the manager to decide how I could develop. We came to an understanding that a loan would be better for me.\u201d\nWest Ham are on a dreadful run and Diangana could be recalled in January. Yet that might not be the best option. He is gaining valuable experience at West Brom, who would like to sign him permanently next summer and he has formed a bond with Bilic, describing the former West Ham manager as a great person.\n\u201cAs soon as I stepped in I felt comfortable. Everyone\u2019s so happy. Everyone\u2019s bantering with each other. I\u2019m a humble character. As soon as I walked through the door the players were just so nice to me. I\u2019m doing well. If the manager called me back I\u2019d be happy to do so but he said I can get 40 games under my belt and I\u2019m happy to do that as well.\u201d\nThis is the first time Diangana, who was in the England Under-21 squad last month, has lived on his own. He was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his family moved to England when he was four. They lived in Bromley-by-Bow in east London before moving to Greenwich and Diangana, who has three brothers and one sister, was in the family home before joining West Brom. \u201cThe training ground was near. And I could get my mum\u2019s cooking.\u201d\nDiangana misses his mum\u2019s African dishes and wants her to teach him how to make them over FaceTime. \u201cThe cooking\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cI have an app that delivers recipes to you.\u201d What if the app breaks down? \u201cYouTube is there. Google is there.\u201d And if the wifi goes down? \u201cI\u2019ll be straight on the phone to my mum.\u201d\nNot that Diangana is suffering from homesickness. Although he is grateful to his parents for making sure he went to bed on time and ate properly when he was a teenager, he likes an adventure. He spoke only French when he moved to England but he quickly picked up English in school. He can understand Lingala, the Congolese language, and a recent trip to Barcelona has convinced him to learn Spanish.\nDiangana, whose girlfriend is studying law in Switzerland, is always looking for the next experience. He is reading a book about geopolitics and his face lights up while discussing his artistic side.\n\u201cI like to draw faces. I\u2019ll have a picture there, one of my dad for example. It helps me relax. It gives me distance from thought processes. You\u2019re zoned out and in your own element. There\u2019s a sense of achievement when you finish. The music is different. You\u2019re creating from your mind. To be able to put it to sound is a nice feeling. I make Afro beat, hip-hop. I want to learn how to play the piano. I like to be creative.\u201d",

They clashed over education budgets, according to people there.\nHe is said to have apologised at the end of the debate when he was told by Sahota that the remarks were offensive.\nDunne released a statement on Thursday: \u201cI apologised to Kuldip Sahota for my comments. I apologise again unreservedly for the offence caused.\u201d\nSahota, the former leader of Telford and Wrekin council, said the remark was reminiscent of the offensive comments he received in the 1970s.\nThe Conservatives did not comment on whether there would be an investigation into Dunne, who has held the seat since 2005.

        "content": "Prime minister\u2019s response to his ice sculpture replacement at Channel 4 was rather chilly \nWhere\u2019s Boris? There were any number of theories doing the rounds as to why the prime minister couldn\u2019t be bothered to turn up for the Channel 4 leaders\u2019 debate on climate change. He was terrified it was a BBC set up and that Andrew Neil would sneak out from behind a curtain and shout \u2018Gotcha\u2019.\nHe was just too shy to show how much he really cared about the environment. Just as he had been too shy to tell David Cameron that austerity was a bad idea back in 2010. He was exhausted after campaigning so hard to unleash the potential of women. Apart from hopeless unmarried mothers of course. They deserved everything they got. Along with the feckless dads who buggered off. There\u2019s going to be hell to pay when Boris Johnson finds out who fathered some of his children.\nJust to show how much he really, really wanted to be there, the prime minister sent along his dad and Michael Gove to the Channel 4 studios in his place. After all, Stanley was almost the same as him \u2013 give or take a few stray mutant genes \u2013 and the Govester had once expressed a vague interest in a polar bear.\nBut Ben de Pear, Channel 4\u2019s news editor, had had to point out that, charming as both men probably were, neither was actually the leader of the Conservatives. And this was a leaders\u2019 debate. In a scene worthy of The Thick of It, Boris then had a temper tantrum at being excluded from a debate from which he had excluded himself and threatened to review Channel 4\u2019s public service broadcasting obligations. Satire had just eaten itself.\nThe debate itself opened with a panoramic set of a world on fire and presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy explaining the Boris no-show and that he had been replaced with an ice sculpture of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The studio lights were turned on full and right on cue the ice sculpture started melting. There was an identical ice sculpture to represent the Brexit party, who also hadn\u2019t bothered to turn up, but no one was too interested in that one. Rather everyone was openly relieved that they didn\u2019t have to engage with Nigel Farage.\nAfter a short video featuring disappearing forests and glaciers, David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and a dead koala, the five party leaders \u2013 the Green\u2019s Si\u00e2n Berry, Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price, the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson \u2013 were invited to indulge in some competitive virtue signalling with their opening statements. They all cared a lot a lot, though Swinson also cared about Brexit. Berry insisted she won first prize as she had cared much longer and the others were all arrivistes. She had a point.\nCorbyn couldn\u2019t believe his luck as he took the first question on climate change targets. Taking one look at the melting Boris, he indulged his obligatory free hit at the Tories. Something each of the leaders would also go on to do. Hell, why not? No one was going to contradict them. If there\u2019s one thing that everyone was agreed on \u2013 apart from the climate emergency being very serious \u2013 it was that the Tories were basically evil.\nThe Conservatives target was 2050, Corbyn said. Which in reality was 2099. So Boris\u2019s secret plan was to kill the entire planet. He would get stuff done by 2030. Sturgeon and Swinson hurriedly tried to explain why their targets of 2045 really meant that they would be carbon neutral even sooner than Labour. Berry took the high ground and pronounced even 2030 to be defeatist and set her own target of 2029. This quickly developed into a free for all, before Sturgeon, the squabbler in chief, asked everyone to stop squabbling. Remembering they were all there to save the planet, all five leaders held hands and observed a minute\u2019s silence for the burnt koala.\nThereafter all five leaders pretty much agreed with each other at every opportunity. People should start to eat a more plant-based diet and everyone should stop flying and take buses. Corbyn even promised to plant 2 billion trees by 2040. Or 200 a minute. There were going to be so many forests, no one would be able to see the wood for the trees.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a copy of our green manifesto,\u201d said the Labour leader.\n\u201cI could have read that online,\u201d Guru-Murthy replied.\nCorbyn chastised himself and promised to make that two billion and one trees. The debate ended with everyone \u2013 even Jeremy who insisted he was already too miserable to turn the heating up \u2013 promising to do a lot better. The one exception was Berry who said she was fed up with lists and that we were probably going to die anyway.\nBut even she was up for a group hug come the closing credits. After all there were no winners in a climate emergency. There were losers though.

The UK is behind only the US, China, Russia and Germany in terms of its global climate impact.\nThe IPPR called on the next government to radically increase the money it spends on helping to fund green initiatives by almost threefold to match its contribution to the climate crisis with funds to help tackle the environmental breakdown.\nThe UK plans to contribute just \u00a31.4bn over the next four years to the UN\u2019s green climate fund but has not set its budget beyond 2023.\nThe call for higher contributions to funding green initiatives is part of a wide-ranging report on the role industrialised nations should play in tackling the climate crisis to help prevent unprecedented financial and political collapse as a result of the climate chaos.\nLaurie Laybourn-Langton, an associate fellow at the thinktank, said there is only a chance of averting a global environmental breakdown if countries \u201ctake on their fair share of sorting it out\u201d.\n\u201cThe UK is a wealthy country with a large past and current contribution to environmental destruction, so should shoulder more of the burden. In an age of environmental breakdown, justice must be hardwired through all international relations,\u201d he said.\nThe calls to shoulder more climate responsibility comes ahead of the UN\u2019s next round of climate talks in Madrid this month. In 2020 the UK will host the event in Glasgow.\nLesley Rankin, an IPPR researcher, said the UK should \u201cforge a positive new role in the world\u201d by coupling its domestic climate ambitions with assistance to help less industrialised countries which are most affected by the environmental crisis.\nThe UK has legislated a target to become a carbon neutral economy by 2050, but continues to support fossil-fuel projects in the developing world through the government\u2019s credit agency, UK Export Finance.\nA failure to prevent runaway climate crisis could result in \u201can unprecedented threat to international cooperation\u201d and a breakdown of the \u201cinternational order\u201d, according to the IPPR.\n\u201cWhilst nations are turning inwards, the impact of the natural breakdown will be cross border,\u201d the report warned. An environmental breakdown could lead to a global economic crisis triggered by a collapse of the insurance industry as severe weather events increase. It could also lead to forced migration and political upheaval.\nIn 2018 alone over 17 million people were estimated to have been displaced by extreme weather and natural disasters, the IPPR said. The World Bank estimates that 140 million people could be displaced within countries in several regions by 2050.",

        "content": "The retiring veteran\u2019s career has spanned the shift from amateurism and seen a great deal of social change\nWhen Alex Blackwell began her elite cricket career in 2001, the landscape of the sport looked very different. The Women\u2019s National Cricket League was entering just its sixth season and it would be a very brave player who dared to dream of full-time professionalism or television coverage for women\u2019s cricket.\nNever one to be plagued by a lack of courage, Blackwell took up the fight to advocate for change in the sport. Little by little, the battles were won and in 2015, she quit her job as a genetic counsellor to become one of the first full-time professionals in women\u2019s cricket, marking the beginning of an era of extraordinary change.\nBlackwell has been at the forefront of this revolution \u2013 her career has seen not only the shift from amateurism to full-time professionalism, but a great deal of social change as well.\nWhile always open about her sexuality with teammates, family and friends, Blackwell chose to come out publicly in 2013. She spoke openly about her disappointment that Cricket Australia had not implemented an anti-homophobia policy, as well as criticising the marketing of women\u2019s sport more broadly, believing sporting bodies chose to centre more traditionally feminine athletes in promotional material.\nIn 2015, Cricket Australia agreed to sign on to the anti-homophobia policy, due in no small part to the pressure from its athletes, including Blackwell, who had the strength and conviction to speak out.\nWhen the national body released its transgender inclusion policy in August this year, Blackwell was one of its most vocal advocates. \u201cTo deprive [transgender people] of access to sport would be wrong,\u201d she said in August. \u201cWe won\u2019t be discriminating based on trans or gender diverse identity.\u201d\nAfter 18 years dominating on the field, there is little chance Blackwell will be short of things to occupy her time when Sydney Thunder\u2019s WBBL season draws to a close. As well as being a qualified genetic counsellor, she is in high demand as a speaker, commentator and media personality.\nIn 2018 she became the first woman to be elected on to the board of Cricket NSW in the organisation\u2019s 159-year history. Earlier this year she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of New South Wales for her work in fighting for equality on and off the cricket pitch.\nAfter retiring from state and national cricket in early 2018, Blackwell threw her energy into Sydney Thunder, a team she had captained to the competition\u2019s maiden title in 2015-16. A possible retirement lurked at the end of the 2018-19 season, but an agonising final ball loss to eventual champions Brisbane Heat in the semi-final was enough to propel her into one final season, though she made the decision to step back from captaincy.\n\u201cI was heartbroken, but also amazed, by last year\u2019s semi-final,\u201d said Blackwell. \u201cI . . . well, a little bit selfishly . . . thought to myself: \u2018I\u2019ve worked so hard to get to this point and contributed to cricket for a long period of time for it to reach this point\u2019. I thought the WBBL was an amazing competition to be a part of and decided I could go again \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased I did. It\u2019s been good fun, and I\u2019ve enjoyed supporting Rachael Haynes because I think she\u2019s led the team very well.\u201d\nHer career with the Thunder has spanned five seasons, 71 matches, 1751 runs and the club\u2019s most valuable player award has been named in her honour.\nAt 36, and with a player-of-the-match honour from Wednesday\u2019s win over the Melbourne Stars still fresh in her back pocket, Blackwell is part of that rare breed of athletes who are able to walk away from the game on their own terms, still at the top of their game, having achieved everything possible in the sport.\nWhen the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final rolls into the MCG in March 2020, with its hopes of world record crowds and Cricket Australia\u2019s commitment to prize money parity for its men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, there is little doubt Blackwell will be there to witness the spectacle, supporting the women who are carrying the baton forward.\nAnd as she does, she may reflect on what 18-year-old Alex would think about it all \u2013 seeing these women carry not just their own hopes and dreams for a World Cup win, but the pride of a nation on their shoulders as they stand on equal footing with their male counterparts.\nAfter 18 years at the top, there is one thing certain about Alex Blackwell \u2013 she has left the game of cricket in a much more fair, equitable, inclusive and better place than it was when she arrived.",

After all, Root has now twice called correctly at the toss and he also sat in on the selection meeting in September where the panel opted against a specialist wicketkeeper in reserve, despite this being a part of the world where flying one in at the last minute is nigh-on impossible.\nPope, wearing the gloves for just the sixth time in his first-class career, was none too shabby, all things considered. But this was still a slightly odd-looking England team, with Jack Leach left out to make it an all-seam attack for the first time since the Headingley Test against South Africa in 2012.\nAs well as a debut for the 6ft 5in Zak Crawley at No 6, Chris Woakes was recalled and, despite just 10 overs on tour, he was the pick of the bowlers. Woakes is potentially playing for a spot on England\u2019s tour of South Africa given Jimmy Anderson\u2019s looming return to fitness and two for 41 helped his case no end.\nBoth captains had wanted to bowl first, not so much in expectation of rolling their opponents in double-quick time but based on the belief that the green-tinged but flat pitch would get easier as the match progressed. The conditions were soupy, leading to the eventually terminal rain, but the Kookaburra did not swing lavishly.\nThat said, Stuart Broad did get a smidgeon first thing when opener Jeet Raval drove loosely to Root at slip \u2013 batsman error was chiefly to blame \u2013 and Woakes too when, from first change, a beauty squared up Kane Williamson on four and the England captain held a more acrobatic second down low to his right.\nWoakes thought he had England\u2019s third on the stroke of lunch too when Latham, on 49, was given out lbw. It always looked to have pitched outside leg, however, and after successfully reviewing it, ascampered two gave the left-hander his half-century before lunch.\nLatham is a hugely pleasing batsman on the eye, so dominant off his pads and with sound judgement outside his off-stump. And from a starting point of 39 for two he and Ross Taylor put on 116 run in two-and-a-half hours. Within this came a glorious on-driven four by Taylor off Archer that was probably the short of the day.\nThere was, however, one moment which will grind the gears of Broad for a good while. A greater threat than in Mount Maunganui, the 33-year-old looked to have trapped Taylor for a plumb lbw on 25 when he played around one that nipped in, clenching his fists in celebrations even before umpire Paul Wilson\u2019s finger had gone up.\nTellingly, Taylor did not review immediately yet was talked into sending it upstairs by Latham. Third umpire Bruce Oxenford then surprised almost everyone. First he saw no mark from HotSpot. Then he saw a tremor on snicko, yet the frame after the ball passed the bat. Then he decided to back to HotSpot and decided he saw a smudge. It looked to be there beforehand yet still he overturned it.\nConclusive evidence? The locals will argue after the World Cup final they were due the rub of the green. England, though denied the benefit a replay on a big screen at Seddon Park, clearly disagreed and a spell of grumpy, ragged cricket followed.\nTaylor played like a man who had got away with one too, learning from the shot with a straighter defence and cutting violently en route to a 99-ball half-century. One ball after the milestone Woakes eventually removed him as a slashed backfoot punch gave Root a third catch of the innings at slip.\nBut with Stokes injured and Latham cracking one of Root\u2019s off-breaks down the ground to bring up a fifth century in eight Tests before the rain, some personally fine fielding from the captain was never going to off-set another day of frustration.",

        "content": "Anger from protesters as Joseph Muscat says his job is to \u2018see this investigation concluded\u2019\nMalta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, emerged from a marathon cabinet meeting at 3am on Friday to announce that he would stay in the job until the investigation into the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was complete.\nIn a night of high drama in Valletta, Muscat had summoned ministers to his office to decide whether to grant a presidential pardon to a businessman arrested last week on suspicion of masterminding the journalist\u2019s assassination in October 2017.\nThe businessman, Yorgen Fenech, was apprehended while trying to leave Malta on his yacht. Since being taken into custody, he has requested a presidential pardon in return for providing information on other alleged conspirators.\nFlanked by members of his cabinet, Muscat announced at a press conference that Fenech\u2019s request had been rejected. \u201cI left the final decision with my colleagues, who decided that it\u2019s not fitting to grant a pardon,\u201d he said.\nThe six-and-a-half hour meeting came at a moment when the EU\u2019s smallest member state is under unprecedented international scrutiny, with politicians across Europe raising concerns about the rule of law in Malta. Jean-Claude Juncker, outgoing president of the European commission, speaking on his final day in office, declined to comment on the ongoing criminal investigation in Malta but expressed anxiety over the developing crisis. He said: \u201cI am worried. In more than one country the rule of law is not respected enough ... I am highly concerned.\u201d\nCaruana Galizia, Malta\u2019s best-known investigative journalist, was a thorn in the side of Muscat\u2019s government. In February 2016, she used a leak of offshore information known as the Panama Papers to reveal that Muscat\u2019s energy minister, Konrad Mizzi, and his old friend and chief of staff, Keith Schembri, had become the beneficiaries of secretive Panama shell companies shortly after entering office.\nThe journalist became a target in Malta\u2019s tribal two-party political arena, with her personal security increasingly under threat. On 16 October 2017, she was killed when a bomb placed under the driver\u2019s seat of her rental car was remotely detonated.\nThe prime minister had been expected to face a leadership challenge at the emergency cabinet meeting from his deputy, Chris Fearne. Muscat, who came to power in 2013 and has remained popular with his followers, emerged from the gathering still at the helm of his country. However, he repeated a promise to leave once those who ordered the killing had been identified.\n\u201cI have made a very firm commitment that I want this case to be closed under my watch. I think the authorities have already delivered what many thought could not be delivered, that is major breakthroughs in the investigation. My job is to see this investigation concluded.\u201d\nHis decision to stay on was greeted with howls of fury from protesters who had waited outside until the early hours. The journalist\u2019s son Paul Caruana Galizia, who attended the press conference, shouted at ministers as he left the building.\nWhile police have made a number of significant arrests, none of those taken into custody have been charged.\nIn a separate case showing how corruption allegations have closed in on the government, a court ordered three cabinet ministers on Friday to face a criminal probe over a hospital contract. Two of the ministers had already left the cabinet this week over links to Fenech as the murder case unfolded.\nAs ministers gathered in the Auberge de Castille overlooking the harbour, Fenech was filing a constitutional challenge in the capital\u2019s courthouse.\nUnder questioning from police, he is said to have alleged that Caruana Galizia\u2019s assassination was masterminded by Schembri, who until his resignation on Monday night was Muscat\u2019s chief of staff.\nSchembri was arrested on Tuesday but was released on Thursday night with police saying that, after an \u201cintensive investigation\u201d, they no longer felt the need to hold him under arrest. Schembri\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, Fenech\u2019s lawyers deposited in court a letter to Malta\u2019s president, George Vella, formally asking for a pardon. It stated that Fenech was ready to supply information related to Schembri, Mizzi, Chris Cardona, who suspended himself from the post of economy minister earlier this week, and others. The letter described all those he was prepared to give evidence against as \u201cclose to the prime minister\u201d.\nCardona declared upon resigning that he had \u201cabsolutely no connection with the case\u201d, but had decided to step back \u201cin the national interest\u201d following questioning by police last weekend. Mizzi, who resigned on Tuesday, said he had not committed any crime but was leaving \u201cin light of political, extraordinary and general circumstances in the country\u201d.",

        "content": "But growth in LNG sector alone almost enough to offset decline and result of increase in renewables\nAustralia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have flatlined due to the effects of the drought, which has caused a large drop in carbon dioxide from the agriculture sector.\nThe government\u2019s quarterly greenhouse data for the year to June 2019, published on Friday, shows Australia\u2019s emissions fell by 0.1% on the previous year \u2013 equivalent to 0.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide.\nPrevious government reports showed emissions had risen year-on-year since 2015. The latest report uses newly adjusted numbers for some sectors and instead suggests emissions have increased in some years, slightly dropped in others, but mostly been flat since the abolition of the carbon price scheme in 2014.\nThe small drop is the result of declining emissions from the agriculture and electricity sectors, which fell by 5.9% and 1.2% respectively. Emissions from transport decreased by 0.5%. But these decreases have been almost entirely offset by large increases from other parts of the economy.\nEmissions from stationary energy, including manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors, rose by 3.6% and fugitive emissions are up by 4.4%. Both increases are largely due to the growth in the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry.\nThe sharp drop in emissions from agriculture shows the effect of widespread drought in NSW and Queensland and the impact of the Queensland floods in February. Both have led to significant drops in the amount of cattle on properties.\nTim Baxter, a senior climate solutions researcher at the Climate Council, said there were \u201ctwo stories\u201d beneath the data.\n\u201cFarmers are suffering. That\u2019s part of the drop,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other part of the drop is renewables deployment as a result of a whole bunch of projects coming online for the end of the renewable energy target.\n\u201cThe drought is not something to celebrate, nor is the renewables sector at the moment which is facing a fairly big slump in investment.\u201d\nBaxter said the growth in the LNG sector was almost enough on its own to offset the fall in agricultural emissions and \u201cthe good work of the renewables sector\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a blip in our emissions that isn\u2019t long for this world [due to] plans we have for gas in this country. It will go back up,\u201d he said.\nThe emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the data emissions from electricity had fallen for the third consecutive year. He said emissions from producing Australia\u2019s exports had increased as a share of total emissions from 30.1% to 37.5% over the past five years, largely due to the growth of the LNG industry.\nLabor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the accounts showed that, on a seasonally adjusted and weather normalised basis, emissions continued to rise.\nAdam Bandt, the Greens\u2019 climate spokesman, said drought was \u201cnot an acceptable pollution reduction strategy\u201d.\n\u201cThe sad irony in these figures is that this small drop in pollution is itself due to climate inaction,\u201d he said.\nThe decline in emissions from electricity was confirmed by the The Australia Institute\u2019s monthly national energy emissions audit, which found pollution from the national grid continues to decline due to sharp decrease in coal-fired power.\nHugh Saddler, an energy expert who compiles the report for the institute, said Australia\u2019s coal fleet was ageing, and increasingly requiring \u201csick leave\u201d for repairs. \u201cPower stations like Loy Yang A in Victoria are continually out of action,\u201d he said.\nAnnual generation from coal peaked in January 2009. Since then, black coal generation has fallen 9%, brown coal electricity slumped by 41% and gas-fired power risen by 3%.\nThe decline in coal has been almost entirely replaced by an increase in wind power, rooftop solar panels, large-scale solar farms and hydro electricity.\nRichie Merzian, the Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program director, said with the Bureau of Meteorology warning of a hot summer it was likely the coal fleet would struggle to provide reliable generation.\nThe latest emissions data was released ahead of Taylor\u2019s scheduled trip to United Nations climate talks in Madrid, where Australia is expected to come under pressure over a lack of policy to curb emissions. Several analyses have found Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 target of a 26-28% emissions cut below 2005 levels.\nThe Morrison government has also drawn criticism from other nations for planning to use what are known as carryover credits from the Kyoto Protocol, which some countries consider a loophole to avoid actual reductions. Australia is the only country proposing to use the carryover credits to help meet its Paris target.\nThe climate talks start on Monday and run for two weeks, with ministers mostly attending the second week. Labor has said it will deny Taylor a pair to attend an International Energy Agency conference in Paris next week, on the way to the climate summit, arguing it is inappropriate that he leave parliament while there is a live police investigation into the origins of a doctored document the minister used to attack the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore.",

And he defended the company\u2019s record, saying much of the criticism of it was based on \u201cmisunderstanding and myths\u201d.\nBut its letter to the CMA, FanFair Alliance said the company\u2019s \u201cchequered history\u201d indicated its directors were not fit to run a company they claim would end up with nearly 100% of the UK ticket resale market if the StubHub deal completes.\nThe grouppointed to Viagogo\u2019s \u201cpersistent reluctance to follow consumer protection law\u201d until it was forced into doing so by a court order obtained by the CMA.\nIt also said the company was responsible for \u201ccreating significant volumes of consumer victims\u201d in the UK, pointing to examples of people paying much higher prices than they expected, or buying tickets through the website only to be turned away at the venue. FanFair Alliance highlighted the company\u2019s failure to show up to two parliamentary select committee hearings and also pointed to ongoing court proceedings in European territories and action by consumer bodies in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe Guardian has previously uncovered evidence of the company\u2019s alliances with powerful ticket touts able to harvest thousands of tickets ahead of genuine fans, as well as instances of \u201cprofiteering\u201d from charity events.\nEarlier this year, Google banned Viagogo from paying to appear at the top of search results, sending its website traffic into freefall.\nBut Google reversed its decision earlier this week after the company made a number of commitments to clarify the information it displays to consumers.\nThe ban remains in place in Czech Republic, Sweden, Finland, Hungary, Japan, Slovakia and Taiwan, countries where Viagogo is still the subject of regulatory action.",

It\u2019s unmistakably the work of Radiohead\u2019s frontman, Thom Yorke.\nSome film songs (Stayin\u2019 Alive, The Harder They Come) sit so snugly with the tale that one can barely see the join. Others (Mrs Robinson, Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head) drop like gaudy visitors from another world. It\u2019s an inexact science, a curious alchemy. Norton and Yorke are still figuring it out.\n\u201cAs a director, your job is to take a lot of talented people and pull them into a frequency alignment,\u201d Norton says. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to create a coherent aesthetic. But that\u2019s exactly the wrong headspace to be in with regard to the music. The worst thing you can do is to get in the way. You don\u2019t want to over-manage a whole separate poetry.\u201d\nIf the film and the song should be standalone entities, it therefore follows that the collaborators must be, too. Here they are, perched side-by-side in a posh hotel; the crisply respectable film-maker and the rumpled, elfin musician, like a Norman Rockwell illustration next to a cartoon by Dr Seuss. Norton orders a pot of tea. Yorke, for his part, opts for a tequila. He smiles. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m starting early.\u201d\nNorton has wanted to make a film of Motherless Brooklyn ever since he read Jonathan Lethem\u2019s source novel in 1999. The result is rich, gamey, abundant; a labour of love. Norton wrote the script, called the shots and takes the lead role of Lionel Essrog, a whip-smart private eye who uncovers institutionalised corruption in 1950s New York. Lionel has Tourette\u2019s, which has made him a pariah. He jerks and yelps and puts his hand on random bystanders as though to anchor himself. The condition is a drag but it\u2019s his rocket fuel, too.\nShortly before shooting, Norton decided that Lionel needed a song. Something fractured and beautiful; something to reflect the inside of the man\u2019s head. He found himself thinking of Billie Holiday\u2019s Strange Fruit. \u201cIt\u2019s the most mournful of songs but it\u2019s also political, it\u2019s about living in dark times. And I thought: \u2018Well, you know, Thom is my Billie Holiday.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d Yorke says, as if there\u2019s any other way to take it. \u201cI mean yes, Strange Fruit is like the ultimate song for me.\u201d\nDaily Battles is not Strange Fruit any more than Motherless Brooklyn is Chinatown, the film\u2019s most obvious influence. But it\u2019s an excellent ballad all the same \u2013 something soft, raw and gorgeous tucked amid all that hard-boiled noir aesthetic. Just as Lionel explains that he sometimes feels that he is two people living inside the same body, so the film and the song somehow conspire to share the story between them.\n\u201cYeah, but I had no idea whether it worked or not,\u201d Yorke insists. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird experience, because you\u2019re working outside of the film. But you still have to try to make it personal. Maybe that\u2019s the mark of every good song. If you make it personal it carries everything else with it.\u201d All told, he reckons he just about got away with it. He puts down his shot glass and mimes mopping at his brow.\nIn the end I think I liked Motherless Brooklyn for the same reasons others didn\u2019t (the reviews have been mixed and the box office grim): because it\u2019s lengthy and knotty and longingly romantic as only a dyed-in-the-wool cynic can be. Norton is aware of the problems. He admits that the tale\u2019s clashing ingredients can be both a blessing and a curse. \u201cI\u2019d describe this film to people and say: \u2018Well, it\u2019s a big period epic about dark things in the vein of the best noir. But by the way it\u2019s also got Rain Man at the centre of it.\u2019 People go crosseyed. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve offered them an olive and a piece of chocolate. They think: \u2018I might like them both, but they don\u2019t go together.\u2019\u201d\nNorton and Yorke, it transpires, have known each other for years. They rose up at around the same time, in the mid-1990s, with each man running along a parallel track. Norton was the upstart bright spark of American acting, Oscar-nominated for his screen debut in Primal Fear, playing alongside Brad Pitt in David Fincher\u2019s Fight Club and clashing with the director Tony Kaye on the set of American History X. Yorke, in the meantime, was steering Radiohead towards global stardom and sell-out stadium tours, before buckling under the strain of it all.\nI\u2019ve heard a rumour that they almost worked together last century. Wasn\u2019t Yorke originally tapped to write the soundtrack for Fight Club?\nThe singer nods. \u201cGot the email. Got the script. And I was just too fucked up in the head to do it.\u201d\nNorton takes up the story. \u201cIt was probably my fault. We were listening to The Bends and OK Computer constantly in the makeup trailer. Brad and I were obsessed \u2013 we had those albums on all the time. Then we started leaning on David [Fincher] a little. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if Radiohead could do the score?\u2019\u201d\nYorke, belatedly, is all apologies. \u201cI\u2019d just come off tour. I was mentally incapable of even tying my shoes.\u201d\nInstead it was Jonny Greenwood \u2013 Radiohead\u2019s guitarist \u2013 who first made the move towards film soundtracks; he has scored every Paul Thomas Anderson picture since 2007\u2019s There Will Be Blood. Two years ago, Yorke followed suit, rustling up a haunting electronic arrangement for Luca Guadagnino\u2019s remake of Suspiria. He explains that he spent 18 months on the project; wandered down all kinds of rabbit-holes; dredged up lots of treasure. \u201cBut then it becomes like a weird piece of art criticism where the director listens to all the material and goes: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just take this bit and this bit.\u2019\u201d\nNorton drizzles a spoonful of honey into his tea. \u201cNot to say that we don\u2019t love Luca,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Thom came off Suspiria feeling so burned.\u201d\nThe initial plan was to have Yorke write and record the entire Motherless Brooklyn soundtrack; steeping himself in 1950s Harlem jazz; fitting the film with something like 75-minutes of music. But it was too big an ask; the two men would have fallen out. \u201cThe last thing you want with somebody you know is to get into a bloody situation,\u201d Norton says. \u201cThat\u2019s the nightmare of all nightmares.\u201d\n\u201cThat and the fact that I don\u2019t do jazz,\u201d Yorke adds.\n\u201cWell yeah, it would have been different. Lots of egos. And then I talked to Paul [Thomas Anderson] about it, about maybe working with Jonny [Greenwood]. And he said: \u2018If you expect any iterative back-and-forth flow with Jonny, this is a mirage. He just sends me what he\u2019s got and says: \u2018Good luck to you.\u2019\u201d Norton laughs, a little mirthlessly. \u201cAnd, well, no. That wouldn\u2019t work for me.\u201d\nAs it is, the biggest ego in Motherless Brooklyn is a man named Moses Randolph. He\u2019s loosely based on Robert Moses, the notorious \u201cmaster builder\u2019 of mid-century New York whose creation of the suburbs amounted to a form of social cleansing. But the fact that Moses is played by a bullish Alec Baldwin, who impersonates Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, suggests a more obvious contemporary parallel. Norton insists that this was largely unintentional.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he says. \u201cI finished writing the script in 2012, when the insane clown was still a gameshow host. No one was paying any attention to him then. But then obviously, later on, the resonance increased. So yeah, there are a few signposts there, a few little arrows. But only up to a point.\u201d\nSitting at his side, Yorke heaves a heavy sigh. \u201cTrump\u2019s going to be gone soon anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be history. The real question is why we keep producing people like Trump.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d go further,\u201d chips in Norton. \u201cThe really dangerous people are the ones you can\u2019t see. Trump is someone else\u2019s puppet. It\u2019s the people in the shadows you have to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cRobert Mercer,\u201d says Yorke.\n\u201cThe Koch brothers,\u201d breathes Norton. The men stare down at the carpet as though in search of dark patterns, two contrasting talents in harmony at last.\n Motherless Brooklyn is out on 6 December.",

Between Candlemas and Shrove Tuesday the four high villages in this alpine region in canton Valais are roamed by nightmarish-looking figures known as the Tsch\u00e4gg\u00e4tt\u00e4. The fur-clad beasts \u2013 with fearsome expressions carved into oversize wooden masks and cow bells belted to their waists \u2013 might steal your woolly hat, push you to the ground and terrorise your children. But it\u2019s all in the name of fun. A tradition in the area since the mid-19th century, but probably dating back far further, Tsch\u00e4gg\u00e4ttu culminates in a procession from Blatten to Ferden on the evening of 20 February, followed by an afternoon carnival parade in Wiler two days later.StayHotel Bietschhorn, in Kippel, has doubles from \u00a386, though it can be busy in February; a good alternative is Hotel de Londres in Brig, which has doubles from \u00a3130.Caroline Bishop\nKurentovanje, Ptuj, 15-25 February 2020\n\n Whip cracks split the slate-cold February sky. You hear their echo before you see the whippers themselves: a gaggle of men dressed in 19th-century costume. They have puffy white shirtsleeves, embroidered vests and leather britches, their bullwhips are in hand but there is an incongruous abundance of brightly coloured flowers bedecking their hats. They are here to chase away winter, but they are not alone. They clear the path for a special sort of monster: a benevolent demon who strikes terror into the evil winter spirits and drives them away. Following them are villagers dressed as kurenti. Kurent is the protagonist of Slovenia\u2019s oldest holiday, Kurentovanje. It is a holdover of ancient Slavic rites of spring, which were adapted into Christianity\u2019s timeline, linking pagan spring rituals with Shrovetide and Lent.\nThe north-eastern town of Ptuj (puh-tooey) crowned by a castle and ringed with Roman ruins, hosts the most famous kurentovanje parade. The ritual looks primeval, tribal, eerie. The costume for kurenti involves a long-haired sheepskin suit that rises above the head into a fearsome, towering mask, decorated with bull horns, a wooden face, bristly moustache and lolling leather tongue. A belt of cowbells clangs as they dance, and they wield maces made of hedgehog spines. Then this monster parade leads to a street party involving homemade schnapps, mulled wine and giant doughnuts stuffed with apricot marmalade.Stay Muzikafe is a hostel that puts on live music, performances and workshops; double/twin from \u20ac47, room only.Noah Charney\nSt Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Day, 5 December\nBeing accosted by the devil, bundled into his sack, then carried away to hell doesn\u2019t sound like the most child-friendly festival jape. But that\u2019s what awaits mischievous Czech children on St Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Day. The festival is a celebration of St Nicholas, patron saint of children, lardily embodied as Father Christmas in most countries. Not so in the Czech Republic. With Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek (baby Jesus) tasked with bringing the gifts on Christmas Day here, St Mikul\u00e1\u0161 gets his day of generosity on 5 December. Head to Prague\u2019s Old Town Square around 4pm to see the action. A curious mix of Santa\u2019s grotto and Halloween, the event sees Mikul\u00e1\u0161, a tall, white-bearded figure, accompanied around the square by an angel and a devil. Children are quizzed as to whether they\u2019ve been good or not, and after reciting a poem or singing a song are given sweets. If deemed naughty, however, the devil threatens to put them in his sack \u2013 often accessorised by fake kids\u2019 legs sticking scarily out of the bottom. Grab a mulled wine or cup of grog and watch the laughter (and tears) unfold.Stay Close to the Old Town Square, Hotel Melantrich has doubles from \u20ac88 B&B.Mark Pickering\nEls Enfarinats, Ibi, Alicante, 28 December\nThis riotous 200-year-old festival takes place on the Day of the Innocents \u2013 the Spanish equivalent of April Fools\u2019 Day \u2013 and is a light-hearted dig at authority, though its precise origins have been forgotten. Early in the morning, a group of married men from the town \u2013 Els Enfarinats, \u201cthe floured ones\u201d \u2013 stage a mock coup and set about imposing absurd new laws on the town\u2019s inhabitants, demanding fines for disobedience. The townspeople resist and running battles ensue, with flour and eggs the weapons of choice, until a ceasefire is called for lunch. Fines and a revolutionary tax imposed on local businesses are donated to a local old people\u2019s home, and the festival ends with a dance.Stay For a ringside seat, stay at Casa Rosalia in the town centre. It has doubles from \u20ac78 that can be reserved at booking.com.Annette Pacey\nRauhnacht, Bavaria, 5 January\nSouthern Germans are used to flamboyant Christmas characters, not least the terrifying half-goat, half-demon Krampus, who appears on Bavarian streets on Krampusnacht (5 December). But in some places, most notably the village of Waldkirchen, Krampus is small fry compared with the pagan-style characters who come out for Rauhnacht. Locals dress in furs, capes, horns and frightening masks and run through the cobbled streets, groaning and screaming, and carrying blazing torches. They represent scary souls who have made a pact with the devil and are attempting redemption; they lead their followers, a mix of locals and visitors, to the city centre, where a straw doll representing evil is ritually burned.Stay Herzst\u00fcck Waldkirchen (doubles from \u20ac164) has modern rooms and generous breakfasts.Paul Sullivan\nHorn-blowing, various dates\nBlowing the midwinter horn is a December tradition in the rural east and north of the Netherlands. The wooden horn is similar to an alpine horn and produces a low, melancholy sound. Some historians say it used to be a pagan tradition to scare evil spirits away during the dark winter months, though the horn was also used as a means of communication between farmers \u2013 and to warn smugglers of the police. Midwinter horn demonstrations are given in many villages between the first Sunday of Advent and Epiphany (6 January). Every year hornblowers, dressed like farmers in blue smocks with clogs, play at various spots in the countryside and walkers are offered mulled wine or hot chocolate. For example, on 15 December there is a midwinter hornwalk in Oud Avereest, a village in the province of Overijssel, starting from 10.30am at visitor\u2019s centre De Wheem.Stay De Zilveren Maan (doubles from \u20ac105) is a farmhouse B&B in the village of Balkbrug, close to Oud Avereest.Renate van der Zee\nSappada festival, January-February\nThe sleepy alpine village of Sappada abruptly awakens every winter for its raucous carnival, spread across the three Sundays leading up to Lent. The festival is led by the Rollate. Resembling a cross between man and bear, they wear hooded black pelts, stripey trousers, wooden masks and heavy bells. Their origins are something of a mystery. Initially, they were used to scare children away from the carnival - historically reserved for adults. These days, their main function is to steer along the festivities, which consist of locals dressed as peasants, paupers and aristocrats \u2013 a nod to the village\u2019s social history. Festival dates for 2020.Stay Hotel Posta (doubles from \u20ac74) offers traditional Alpine bed and breakfast in the centre of Sappada.Alex Sakalis\nKjippen, 31 December\nKjippen is an odd carnival in Flor\u00f8, the most westerly town in Norway. It happens every New Year\u2019s Eve and starts, precisely, at midnight. Locals go to great lengths in dressing up for the parade along cobbled streets lined with traditional wooden houses. Participants share satirical commentary on current (local) affairs through their costumes and amplify their messages with floats, street theatre and posters. To be the target of caricature is, however, considered an honour. Live bands and hundreds of spectators add to the atmosphere. At the end of the carnival, all floats and posters end up on a big bonfire, disturbingly close to a petrol station. The tradition goes back to the 1800s in central Europe, where craftsmen in costumes created mayhem (or kjipp) in the streets to protest at low wages. Kjippen has been celebrated since 1900.Stay Kinn Hotell Flor\u00f8 (doubles from \u00a370 B&B) is in a quiet area 1km from the centre. Gunnar Garfors\nThe Burning of the Clavie, 11 January\nScotland\u2019s fire festivals help bring cheer to dark winter nights, from the torchlight processions and fireworks at Hogmanay to the Viking-themed Up Helly Aa in Shetland. One lesser-known event is the Burning of the Clavie in Burghead, a small town in Moray. The celebration has its roots in pagan rituals and is still going strong despite a 1714 law that outlawed it as \u201csuperstitious, idolatrous and sinfule, an abominable heathenish practice\u201d. It takes place on 11 January, New Year\u2019s Eve according to the old Julian calendar, so residents celebrate Hogmanay twice. The \u201cClavie Crew\u201d carry a flaming barrel full of staves around the town and up Doorie Hill, where it burns for hours. Onlookers collect glowing pieces to light their first fire of the (old) new year, or send to loved ones for luck. Then, in another great British tradition, everyone goes to the pub \u2026Stay The Moraybank B&B (doubles from \u00a385) in nearby Elgin is a fine 1845 property with lots of period features.\nTwelfth Night, London\nOne of the biggest Twelfth Night celebrations in the UK takes place on 5 January at Bankside in London, a chance to bid farewell to Christmas and toast the new year. Although the event itself is relatively new \u2013 2020 will be the 25th anniversary \u2013 it brings together ancient midwinter customs. The Holly Man (the winter incarnation of the Green Man) arrives over the Millennium Bridge, accompanied by wassailers and mummers who perform a play about St George. Cakes are given out and the pair who find a concealed pea and bean are crowned king and queen. The procession continues through Borough Market to the 17th-century George Inn for more singing, dancing, storytelling and a wishing tree \u2013 plus plenty of mulled wine and cider.Stay CitizenM Bankside (doubles from \u00a3119) is a stone\u2019s throw from the action.\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?

        "content": "Food shortages affecting 60% of country\u2019s population threaten to make political instability worse, says UN expert\nZimbabwe is on the brink of manmade starvation with close to 60% of the population now food insecure, a UN envoy has said.\nHilal Elver, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said the situation was likely to escalate political instability in the southern African nation. After an 11-day visit to parts of the country worst hit by the El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought, Elver said widespread food insecurity was being exacerbated by hyperinflation.\n\u201cThe people of Zimbabwe are slowly getting to a point of suffering a manmade starvation,\u201d said Elver.\n\u201cMore than 60% of the population of a country once seen as the breadbasket of Africa is now considered food insecure, with most households unable to obtain enough food to meet basic needs due to hyperinflation.\u201d\nAbout 5.5 million rural Zimbabweans and a further 2.2 million in urban centres face food insecurity.\n\u201cThese are shocking figures and the crisis continues to worsen due to poverty and high unemployment, widespread corruption, severe price instabilities, lack of purchasing power, poor agricultural productivity, natural disasters, recurrent droughts and unilateral economic sanctions,\u201d Elver said.\nThe poor rains experienced in the 2018-19 agricultural season have exacerbated the food crisis as the government battles to provide social services.\nElver said the drought has also affected children\u2019s health, with nearly 90% of Zimbabwean infants experiencing malnutrition and stunted growth.\n\u201cChronic malnutrition and stunting is endemic throughout the country, where 90% of children aged six to 24 months consume the minimal diet to survive. The vast majority of children I met in the rural parts of Masvingo and in Mwenezi, as well as in informal settings in the suburbs of Harare, appeared severely stunted and underweight due to reduced food availability caused by high levels of poverty and the consequence of the recurrent drought and floods,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI saw the ravaging effects of malnutrition on infants deprived of breast feeding because of their own mothers\u2019 lack of access to adequate food.\u201d\nAs a result of the prolonged dry spells and food deficiency, said Elver, women were engaging in dehumanising ways of fending for their families, with some turning to prostitution.\n\u201cIn a desperate effort to find alternative means of livelihood, some women and children are resorting to coping mechanisms that violate their most fundamental human rights and freedoms. As a result, school dropouts, early marriage, domestic violence, prostitution and sexual exploitation are on the rise throughout Zimbabwe,\u201d said Elver.\nShe urged the government to take steps to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported food, particularly maize, and to support alternative wheats to diversify the diet. The state should ensure Zimbabwe\u2019s self-sufficiency, said Elver.\n\u201cI call on the government of Zimbabwe to live up to its zero-hunger commitment without any discrimination,\u201d she said.\nElver added that the crisis in Zimbabwe\u2019s cities had also worsened due to the drought. \u201cI witnessed some of the devastating consequences of the acute economic crisis in the streets of Harare, with people waiting for hours in long lines in front of gas stations, banks, and water dispensaries. The Zimbabweans I spoke to in Harare and its suburbs explained that even if food was widely available in markets, the erosion of their incomes, combined with inflation skyrocketing to over 490%, made them suffer from food insecurity, also impacting the middle-class.\u201d\nZimbabwe\u2019s food insecurity could spiral into a security issue, Elver warned.\n\u201cA government official I met in Harare told me: \u2018Food security is national security.\u2019 Never has this been truer than in today\u2019s Zimbabwe. As food insecurity and land mismanagement increase the risks of civil unrest, I urgently call on the government, all political parties and the international community to come together to put an end to this spiralling crisis before it morphs into a full-blown conflict,\u201d she said.\nIn January, Zimbabwe was plunged into a national strike after a steep rise in fuel prices was ordered by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Amid the unrest that followed, several civilians were killed.\nSimilar protests were repeated in August when the main opposition, MDC took to the streets in protest against spiralling prices and deteriorating economic fortunes. Police reacted by violently dispersing protesters who had gathered in central Harare, injuring many.",

It was also a massive commercial flop, and a proposed third title was postponed indefinitely.\nOver the past decade, however, the series has earned near-mythical status and, after a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015 \u2013 the largest the platform had had for a game \u2013 Shenmue III is finally here.\nOnce you get over the initial shock that it actually exists, what you discover is the need for patience. The game progresses at a tectonic pace and contains elements that are firmly stuck in gaming\u2019s past \u2013 most notably patchy animation that at times descends into clunkiness, and outbreaks of very wooden, badly delivered dialogue.\nHowever, Shenmue III contains many aspects that transcend its shortcomings. Suzuki always said that he was trying to create a sort of everyday-life simulator, and Shenmue III achieves that aim to a near obsessive degree.\nIt kicks off where Shenmue II ended, with series protagonist Ryo Hazuki having hooked up with a girl called Shenhua in the tiny Chinese village of Bailu (it\u2019s 1987, although in bucolic Bailu, it may as well be medieval times). Shenhua\u2019s father Yuan, a stonemason, is missing, presumed abducted by a bunch of thugs who have been terrorising Bailu, so the pair embark on a quest to find him that embraces various locations and plot twists.\nIn tune with those life-simulator ambitions, Ryo\u2019s health depletes if he doesn\u2019t eat, and Shenmue III\u2019s virtual economy figures prominently. By far the best way to make money is to collect herbs \u2013 a tranquil pursuit that proves infuriatingly compelling. Ryo can also take jobs such as chopping wood or driving a forklift, which essentially involve playing mini-games. You need money to buy expensive objects during some missions, and there are countless ways to spend cash in Shenmue III, such as playing fairground games or hanging around in arcades, where you can win objects that may be cashed in at pawnbrokers.\nThen there are the capsule dispensers, which feed into the main kung fu fighting engine. You can exchange sets of the toys you find in them for otherwise pricey Skill Books, which teach Ryo new kung fu moves that he can then level-up by sparring in dojos. Specific mini-games let him improve stamina and health. It\u2019s an oddly constructed system but it works; the fighting is fun and tactical, as you string together the moves you\u2019ve ingrained into Ryo in the dojo, and block when necessary.\nIt pays to keep honing your kung fu whenever you get a spare moment, and Shenmue III\u2019s day/night structure ensures you get plenty of opportunities. At a certain time each evening, Ryo is whisked back to his house or hotel. Often, you find that after a successful bout of detective work \u2013punctuated by bouts of fighting, action sequences involving the franchise\u2019s famous (and somewhat antiquated) quick time events and episodes of puzzling \u2013 you have time to fill before summarising the day\u2019s events with Shenhua.\nThere are periods of grinding, especially when building up the necessary skills to take on bosses, who can only be defeated with special moves taught to you by kung fu masters who must be persuaded to share their secrets. By the time you reach the boss fights, you will have got to know every nook and cranny of your particular location, and acquainted yourself with just about everyone who lives there. Bailu, in particular, has an enticing quality of calmness and tranquillity, and whereas the Yakuza games (made by some of the original Shenmue team) major on grittiness, Shenmue III maintains a naive, Zen-like and thoroughly charming air.\nIf you demand constant action from your video games, it would be advisable to steer clear of this one. It is a more substantial experience, it is wilfully nostalgic, it is intended, to some extent, as a retort to the constant bustle of modern-day life. And despite the limitations of a comparatively modest budget, Suzuki has largely realised his endearing vision \u2013 part Studio Ghibli, part Karate Kid. It\u2019s a game that suckers you into performing the most mundane tasks while somehow rendering them enjoyable.\nIf you played the first two games, the way Shenmue III uses modern technology to restablish the classic lore and gameplay may just bring tears to your eyes. It will certainly remind you of Suzuki\u2019s genius. Certainly, it contains eccentricities that feel old-fashioned, but it also offers epic, immersive and calming escapism. For gamers of a certain age, it\u2019s the ultimate nostalgia trip.",

However, when it broke down on the M1, the RAC sent an independent contractor who took one look and said that the vehicle was too long and heavy for him to tow, before departing. \nAfter failed promises by the RAC, my brother had to find and pay a commercial tow firm \u00a3340 to take the vehicle to a garage. Ten hours elapsed between his initial call to the RAC and the rescue. Under normal circumstances that\u2019s inconvenient, but his wife has regular seizures, which made the wait positively dangerous. \nIB, Cambridge\n Complaints about roadside assistance have increased 71% in the last financial year and are rising again, according to Martyn James of complaints-handling website Resolver. The most recent reviews on Trustpilot report waits of up to 12 hours for rescue by the RAC, which has been accused of reducing its staff and increasing premiums since being bought out by a private equity firm in 2011.\nLast year, I reported the ordeal of a camper van driver who was stranded on a remote Welsh hillside for more than 30 hours after RAC subcontractors were unable to tow his vehicle. The RAC says that your brother was abandoned because his motor home exceeded the maximum length allowed under his policy and that he should have bought a specialist \u201cArrival\u201d policy that covers vehicles more than 6.4 metres long. However, it admits that it failed him.\n\u201cWe should have informed him that his policy didn\u2019t cover large vehicles when he first rang us and let him know he would have to pay for recovery. As a result of this, it led to delays in being able to make his own arrangements.\n\u201cAs a gesture of goodwill, we\u2019ll be refunding the cost of the tow he paid for. We also offered to upgrade him to our specialist motorhome breakdown service, but instead he has chosen to cancel his policy with a full refund.\u201d\nTedious as small print is, it pays to slog through it when buying cover. Motorists who are left impotent at the roadside are left stranded again when it comes to mediation because, unlike other insurance, roadside assistance was omitted from the Financial Services Act, so customers can\u2019t complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service if their policy doesn\u2019t deliver.\n If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "content": "Buildings designed to bring the benefits of the outdoors indoors give people happier, healthier lives\n\u201cI love the space all around here,\u201d says care home resident John Ryan. \u201cPrevious homes I have lived in have been large, Victorian-style houses and in the garden you would have a monkey puzzle tree with a little area to walk around in a circle, and that\u2019s it. Very boring.\u201d\nThe 85-year-old is anything but bored now. As he reminisces about his younger days travelling the world with his wife and working in agriculture, he pauses now and then to play a fish-themed game on the interactive table in front of him. When another resident joins him, the game is changed to a gentler challenge \u2013 painting colour on to a blossoming tree. It is one of a number of nature-themed activities residents at West Hall care home can take part in, from bingo and pub quizzes to art.\nIt is perhaps not surprising that nature plays such a central role in the lives of residents. The Anchor-run property in West Byfleet, Surrey, is in the middle of the greenbelt, surrounded by lush fields and trees, and wildlife including deer.\nLike many care homes, there are landscaped gardens for residents to enjoy. But what\u2019s special about West Hall is how it ensures less mobile residents can also reap the benefits of being in nature through clever design features that bring the outdoors indoors.\nThe home is split between a converted 18th-century manor house and three purpose-built lodges. Their shape maximises light, while curving timber shutters enclosing the building are designed to protect residents from the full glare of the sun.\nAt Birch Lodge, where the majority of residents are living with dementia, the garden room features breathtaking views of the grounds through floor-to-ceiling windows. A door leads to a covered veranda known as the \u201cpotting shed\u201d: here residents can relax in wicker armchairs, do some gardening or enjoy the fresh air without being exposed to the elements. Paintings of flowers, trees and animals by residents cover the corridor walls, while the dining room is flooded with natural light. On warm days, residents can eat outside on a covered patio.\nResident Chris Hardy, 61, says the design of the building has transformed his quality of life. \u201cI was previously in a different care home where everyone was in one large central building,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the openness of the spaces here makes me feel more in touch with nature.\n\u201cMy room is fairly close to the tree line so I get a view of an array of different garden birds. I get a lot of satisfaction from watching them.\u201d\nThe West Hall manager, Tracy Manzi, says the building\u2019s design is especially beneficial for people with dementia. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel so shut in and enclosed,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, this is a secure environment \u2013 they can\u2019t go walking out to the high street. But they don\u2019t feel trapped.\u201d\nShe adds: \u201cThere is a variety of spaces we can utilise to connect residents with nature, whether that\u2019s through themed activities or simply enjoying the feeling of being outdoors in an indoor environment. That gives residents a quality of life that they wouldn\u2019t get elsewhere. The spaces make people feel better, and because they are feeling better, they eat better, they drink better and they stay mobile.\u201d\nResearch into design based on biophilia \u2013 a love of life or living systems \u2013 backs up these claims. A study this summer found that when care homes are designed to enable greater connections with nature, residents\u2019 moods improved and social interaction increased. Even activities as simple as looking at natural scenes such as clouds moving across the sky or leaves rustling in the breeze can have a restorative effect on the brain.\nArchitecture firm HSSP has designed around a dozen care homes in the past seven years, all with biophilic ideas at their core. The company\u2019s main aim is to move away from the institutional style of building which has dominated the sector for decades.\nOne major project in which James Botterill, director of HSSP, has successfully used biophilic design to improve indoor living is Magnum Care Home in Stamford, Rutland. Large windows at the front of the central communal building maximise the open views of the area\u2019s Elizabethan landmark, Burghley House, and the River Welland. Internal spaces, from bedrooms to corridors, are filled with natural daylight even during winter.\n\u201cOne of the things we are trying to do is ensure that no matter where you are in the building, you have that constant connection with the outdoors,\u201d says Botterill. \u201cFor someone who has dementia, that can also help them orientate. So that might be as simple as a view at the end of the corridor.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just residents who benefit: staff are also feeling uplifted in care homes that place an emphasis on bringing nature indoors. And that has a knock-on effect on the level of care provided.\nManzi explains: \u201cIf you are going to go into a small, dark, dingy environment, you are going to feel miserable and unstimulated. A lot of care staff work 12-hour days and in a standard care home they might not see daylight all day. So you can\u2019t help but have your spirits lifted when you come and work in a place where you feel connected with nature.\u201d",

        "content": "(Mad Decent) The Syrian musician has released 500 records and now lives in exile in Turkey, but this short, sharp record shows an undimmed spirit \nThere was a glorious moment during Syrian singer Omar Souleyman\u2019s 2011 Glastonbury set. Having just opened to a crowd of sedate, sun-baked West Holts revellers with the trilling saz lines of ballad Saba, he gives one waft of his hand and commands the entire crowd into a dabke-fuelled frenzy.\nHis keyboard player starts hammering out electronic drums on the keys, while Souleyman wails deep-throated entreaties to his audience; it is a joyous encapsulation of his music and appeal.\nSouleyman was on the cusp of mainstream recognition in 2011, releasing compilations Leh Jani and Haflat Gharbia \u2013 made up from his more than 500 bootleg recordings made during weddings and local concerts. In 2013, he released his Four Tet-produced debut LP, Wenu Wenu, marking him out as a dancefloor staple rather than an obscure novelty. Now, eight years and two more LPs along, not to mention a self-imposed exile to Turkey due to the ongoing civil war in Syria, and Souleyman can be found on almost every major festival lineup come summer.\nHis latest, Shlon, doesn\u2019t much alter the dabke-techno formula established on Wenu Wenu. Each of the six tracks is billed as a \u201clove song\u201d and features poetry from his longtime collaborator Moussa Al Mardood, which Souleyman expresses in his throaty, powerful baritone, while fast-paced chromatic compositions come from keyboardist Hasan Alo and saz player Azad Salih. The kitsch, handclap-heavy percussion of the early records is replaced with a deeper, rumbling groove on the opening title track \u2013 not to mention a hint of Balearic synth on the bridge \u2013 while the major chord trance of Shi Tridin and the footwork-style layered percussion of Abou Zilif all sit comfortably within the club space.\nSlower traditional number Mawwal is a highlight, featuring a cinematic opening courtesy of Salih\u2019s noodling saz. Here Souleyman\u2019s rich voice is given breathing space to sing lyrics of everlasting love in a softer, pleading register. On Mawwal, Souleyman shows his years of experience; he\u2019s a consummate folk singer, as well as an entertainer.\nUltimately, Souleyman doesn\u2019t need to alter his formula, which has served him for more than 500 records and still brings an often unexpected joy to its new listeners. Shlon is a short and sharp addition to his discography and proof that his passion for the music is undiminished.\nTheir album Tiris, originally released in 1994 on a small CD run for Oxfam Belgium, of all places, the Saharan folk of Sahrawi group El Wali gets a much-needed reissue. Their politically charged lyrics, demanding a national identity for their nomadic people, are backed by 80s synth-funk textures and propulsive, danceable rhythms.\nAnother reissue is the beautiful, star-gazing psychedelics of Issam Hajali\u2019s Mouasalat Ila Jacad El Ard. Recorded in 1977, while in exile in Paris from his home country of Lebanon, Hajali\u2019s soft vocals adorn the Minnie Riperton-referencing soul of the title track, while Nick Drake harmonies run throughout Khobs, creating a record that represents the heady cultural mix of the Parisian 70s.\nIn S\u00e3o Paolo, singer-songwriter Sessa channels the humid bossa nova of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and Caetano Veloso on his debut album, Grandeza; his whispered vocals and clattering background percussion provide a soothing, subdued close to the year.",

This crime is punishable by life in prison. Another new crime, \u201caggravated abortion murder\u201d, is punishable by death, according to the bill.\nThe bill is sponsored by representatives Candice Keller and Ron Hood, and co-sponsored by 19 members of Ohio\u2019s 99-member House.\nMike Gonidakis, the president of the anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life, declined to comment on the bill, and said he was still reading the legislation because, it\u2019s \u201capproximately 700 pages long\u201d. He said his office is \u201ctaking off the rest of the week for Thanksgiving\u201d.\nThe Guardian also contacted the Susan B Anthony List, a national anti-abortion organization. The organization did not reply to a request for comment.\nKeller, Hood and eight of the bill\u2019s 19 co-sponsors did not reply to requests for comment. The Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association also did not reply to a request for comment.\nOhio passed a six-week abortion ban last summer. The \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d, as supporters called it, banned abortion before most women know they are pregnant. Reproductive rights groups immediately sued, and the bill never went into effect. Abortion is legal in all 50 US states.\nIn May, researcher Dr Daniel Grossman argued reimplanting a fertilized egg or embryo is \u201cpure science fiction\u201d in a Twitter thread that went viral in May, when the bill was first introduced.\nHi @BeckerGOP, I\u2019m a practicing ob-gyn and researcher on abortion and contraception, and thought you might want some help understanding ectopic pregnancy since your bill (HB182) gets some things wrong. I\u2019ll clear up a few things in this thread. https://t.co/BdXYHnCAtI\n\u201cThere is no procedure to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d said Dr Chris Zahn, vice-president of practice activities at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. \u201cIt is not possible to move an ectopic pregnancy from a fallopian tube, or anywhere else it might have implanted, to the uterus,\u201d he said.\n\u201cReimplantation is not physiologically possible. Women with ectopic pregnancies are at risk for catastrophic hemorrhage and death in the setting of an ectopic pregnancy, and treating the ectopic pregnancy can certainly save a mom\u2019s life,\u201d said Zahn.",

You should be annoyed,\u201d McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThe reason he is doing this is because he thinks, like his Bullingdon friends, that they are above the rest of us, that they don\u2019t need to be held to account, they don\u2019t need to be treated like the rest of us,\u201d he said, referring to the elite club of which Johnson and other senior Tories were members at Oxford University.\nThe shadow chancellor said Johnson was avoiding Neil, who is due to interview the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Jo Swinson and the Brexit party\u2019s Nigel Farage next week, because he knew that the broadcaster would \u201ctake him apart\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s running scared, but also, even if he does it now, he has played you. He is pushing it later and later beyond the postal vote returns. You are being played as the BBC and you should be as angry as we are,\u201d he added.\nA BBC source has strongly denied it told Labour that Johnson had confirmed.\nThe BBC has yet to confirm the date of the prime minister\u2019s appearance, leading to Labour concerns that Johnson could be tempted to sidestep scrutiny from one of the broadcaster\u2019s leading political interviewers.\nMcDonnell appeared to avoid confirming or denying that Labour had been given assurances that Johnson would take part. Asked if this had been the case, he said all the parties had \u201cunderstood\u201d there would be a sequence of interviews and he viewed it as \u201ca matter of honour\u201d.\nJohnson has agreed to other broadcast events during the campaign, including last Friday\u2019s Question Time special, and the Tories believe this will insulate him from the charge of cowardice even if they decide to skip the Neil interview.\nCorbyn\u2019s interview with the broadcaster resulted in widespread negative press coverage after the Labour leader declined to apologise directly over antisemitism in his party and was grilled over his proposed \u00a358bn boost for women caught out by changes to the state pension age.",

Yet for profound reasons that go beyond the enigmatic set-up, we can never know what it thinks.

At Alexander Wright\u2019s immersive production The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the Jordan Belfort memoir made infamous by Martin Scorsese\u2019s adrenaline-fuelled film, too many of us are squeezed into flimsily clad, shoddily decorated, too-tight spaces for any of the feral and fraudulent action to feel intimate.\nIt\u2019s our first day at stockbrokers Stratton Oakmont, where the drug-guzzling criminal multimillionaire Belfort (a writhing Oliver Tilney) is promising to make us rich. Our group is taken to Geneva to set up a new bank. Along the way, some are arrested for money laundering, others head off with the drug dealer and a select few peel off for a promised wild night of sex.\nAll movement is strictly controlled as we\u2019re ushered from one bland corporate room to another. In the rare moments we are allowed to nose around, details are scarce; the admin hasn\u2019t been done to make us believe in the lie. Our mission is quickly buried under a flurry of $100 bills, and for much of the night, we float alongside the action rather than within it. When we\u2019re later let into the Belfort family home to watch how drugs destroy a life, our presence makes little sense. Are we no longer going to Switzerland? Is it still our first day? If the plan was for us to quietly hover, they could at least have given us a seat.\nThe show makes us complicit in Befort\u2019s wrongdoings. \u201cToo fucking easy, right?\u201d Belfort chants after being cleared of a case of sexual assault. But what makes the night most uncomfortable is when over-zealous audience members use the characters\u2019 vile behaviour as an excuse to echo it themselves. At one point James Byrant, playing Belfort\u2019s right-hand man, shuts down a man who throws a racist insult on stage: leave it to the professionals, Byrant warns. But they can\u2019t monitor everything, and other instances occur that don\u2019t get taken care of.\nThe actors all do a stellar job plate-spinning, and it\u2019s fun to dress up and be bathed in dollar bills, but as a whole this production is a timid sheep in the sharp-cut suit of a wolf.\nBooking until 19 January.",

But Ms Banks has, understandably, been busy. The south-east London rapper kicked off the year by appearing on stage with Little Mix at the Brits, before providing guest vocals on R&B singer Tinashe\u2019s new album, and just this week, on a remix of Jorja Smith\u2019s latest single, Be Honest. Still unsigned, Banks is following a well-trodden path for UK rap stars in 2019 by eschewing major labels to build her own artistic and brand connections. Her support slots for Cardi B and an as-yet-unreleased collaboration with Nicki Minaj suggest the plan is working.\nWhere the first album was downbeat and trap-oriented, the second leans more into afropop rhythms and captures the euphoric glow of an artist whose star is rising. Banks is steely yet playful on the come-up anthem Back Up in This; she taunts an ex with a low, melodic hook on the dancehall-tinged Again, and she glides gleefully over UK garage on the Conducta-produced standout Desire. Over sparse, creeping synth pads on Bad B Bop, she declares: \u201cbitches can\u2019t match me / But they wanna @ me.\u201d These are the most memorable and danceable Ms Banks songs to date. She\u2019s funny (\u201cup in every spot like acne\u201d), she\u2019s got range, and she\u2019s proving that, even as winter approaches, she can make the most sultry of summer bangers.",

        "content": "In Jennifer Kent\u2019s follow-up to The Babadook, set in 19th-century Tasmania, an Irishwoman seeks payback after being brutally gang-raped by British troops \nJennifer Kent is the Australian actor-turned-director who in 2014 made a sensational feature debut with her cult horror classic The Babadook, about a child\u2019s haunted storybook. Now she has switched modes to a more obviously brutal and generically familiar kind of period Australian cinema, and for the first 20 minutes of The Nightingale, I missed the subtler, more sinuous and more contemporary kind of film-making of that first movie.\nThe Nightingale initially feels like a rape-revenge horror heading one way and in one style. But the power and sheer command of Kent\u2019s direction enforced this film\u2019s grip on me, along with the fluency and urgency of her storytelling, the eerily beautiful images of wilderness from cinematographer Radek \u0141adczuk and the fiercely committed performances of Aisling Franciosi in the lead and of the indigenous Australian actor Baykali Ganambarr. Kent\u2019s central narrative thrust branches and diversifies into something more complex, so that the movie even becomes a kind of epic, although perhaps the ending, and grisly, long-anticipated climax, make it feel as if the story has run out of road.\nThe setting is 19th-century Tasmania (Iutruwita in the indigenous language) where arrogant Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) presides over an undisciplined and demoralised company of English soldiers with the help of a boorish Sergeant Ruse (Damon Herriman), brutalising the indigenous peoples with a quasi-genocidal programme of land clearance. In his garrison, where sloppiness and drunkenness is the order of every day, Hawkins is attended by young Irishwoman Clare (Franciosi), a former convict, now married with a young baby; her early release ordered by Hawkins. He is smirkingly infatuated with her beauty and lovely singing voice \u2013 he has nicknamed her \u201cThe Nightingale\u201d \u2013 while smugly reminding her what she supposedly owes him. Soon, Hawkins violently takes what he claims is his, along with other soldiers, in a brutal gang rape.\nWith a terrible inevitability, Clare somehow survives the mass assault and this cowed songbird becomes a bird of prey intent on vengeance, while in anguish from what she has experienced and, in a refinement of her agony, still lactating. As Hawkins sets off on a journey to the nearest township to demand the promotion he petulantly claims is justly his, Clare follows with the help of indigenous Australian tracker Mangana, or Billy, nicknamed \u201cBlackbird\u201d (Ganambarr).\nClare and Billy make common cause against the English imperial invader: both have experience of being colonial subjects, and then being seconded to a kind of servant-administrator class burdened with making this imperial larceny work. Billy at first sees Clare as nothing but white. \u201cYou England,\u201d he says and Clare replies: \u201cI\u2019m Ireland, I hate the fuckin\u2019 English.\u201d The relationship between the two does not exactly deepen or become more nuanced, but it accumulates in strength as they go on their horrendous journey, surviving horrors that will include more murder and more rape.\nThe Nightingale is not dissimiliar in its mise-en-scene to Justin Kurzel\u2019s True History of the Kelly Gang, scheduled for release here next year and it is arguably in an Australian-exploitation vein. The violent horror and despair in The Nightingale is stomach-turning, but it could well be that it hardly conveys a fraction of the reality of what was actually involved in subduing the Australian continent, not to mention its use as a judicial dustbin. The intelligence of Kent\u2019s direction and the humanity she reveals in both Clare and Billy give the film its arrowhead of power.\n The Nightingale is released in the UK on 29 November.",

The ludicrous STFU! careens between clumpy dreads-era Korn and cutesy, 99-era Britney, swilling warm beer everywhere one minute before cheekily sipping on a Hooch the next. It is the aural equivalent of a Paris Hilton-designed range of nu-metal chain-wallets, the sweat stains spreading across diamant\u00e9 crystals.\nJessie J was huge, wasn\u2019t she? Even when she said breaking her foot gave her \u201ca different respect \u2026 for people who don\u2019t have legs\u201d she was still massive. Last year, however, saw her competing on a TV talent show in China, giving her a different respect for, say, Wagner.

The scientists say we have never been less likely to stay below 1.5 degrees [above pre-industrial levels].\u201d\nFriday\u2019s action comes after more alarming news on the scale and scope of the climate crisis. This week scientists warned the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points posing an \u201cexistential threat to civilisation\u201d.\nTwo days earlier a separate study from the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization revealed that the concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere had hit a record high.\nThe climate crisis has emerged as one of the key issues in the UK election. On Thursday evening the main party leaders \u2013 except the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who refused to participate \u2013 took part in a climate and nature TV debate.\nBeth Irving, from the UK Student Climate Network, which helped organise Friday\u2019s strikes, said it was crucial political leaders were held to account over their plans to tackle the emergency.\n\u201cThe upcoming election will determine how the UK addresses climate change, with significant effects for the planet and its people. We have just a small window of time for action and the next few years are crucial.\u201d\nThe strikes are part of a global movement that began in August last year when Thunberg began a weekly solo protest outside Sweden\u2019s parliament. Since then millions of people in thousands of towns and cities around the world have taken part in an effort to raise the alarm.\nPublic concern over the climate is now at its highest recorded level, while a majority of voters say climate will influence how they vote in the upcoming election. In September, 300,000 people in the UK joined the last global climate strike, which coincided with the United Nations climate summit.\nIrving said: \u201cOver the last months, young people have taken to the streets to demand strong climate action but many of us cannot vote; this week we will be taking to the streets to make our voices heard. This must be a climate election.\u201d",

But taking pride of place in the programme for West Side Story is Leicestershire police\u2019s Simon Cole, a signal of how seriously director Nikolai Foster takes the violence between the feuding Jets and Sharks. In a production as gritty and confrontational as it is musically accomplished, Foster goes further than most in eradicating the musical theatre wholesomeness of this classic show.\nYou see it in the urban decay of Michael Taylor\u2019s set. With a tattered US flag overhead, he kettles the characters between mesh fences like basketball courts or prison exercise yards, too tempting for gang members to resist scaling. Fridges and televisions stick out of a heap of rubble, flickering remnants of the consumer dream, while the Jets\u2019 jukebox hangout is all exposed concrete and rusting ladders. Guy Hoare\u2019s lighting adds to the bleakness with a chilly depth of field.\nYou see it also in Ellen Kane\u2019s exuberant choreography. As an excellent Carly Mercedes Dyer says in the role of Anita, they dance \u201clike they have to get rid of something quick\u201d. Hips swing hard and skirts twirl high. Moves are bold and aggressive. Yes, the violence is stylised but, amplified by Kevin McCurdy\u2019s brutal fight direction, it convinces you something real is at stake.\nNot that it\u2019s all macho posturing. Musical supervisor Sarah Travis and musical director George Dyer are sensitive to the dynamics of the score, as confident stripping it as going full pelt. As Tony, Jamie Muscato has the confidence to sing Something\u2019s Coming as a quiet and reflective soliloquy, his manner relaxed and seductive. His rendering of Maria is equally alive to light and shade.\nLike Romeo and Juliet before it, West Side Story only works if you fall for the protagonists \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t be won over by this pair? Muscato and Adriana Ivelisse\u2019s Maria are all adoring faces and love-struck giggles. Their harmonies on Tonight feel like an act of naked intimacy. At the heart of a large and formidable ensemble, they make their tragedy feel universal.\nAt the Curve, Leicester, until 11 January.",

After a short time covering him on the campaign trail, I thought he would do a lot better then people expected. By the time of the next general election, in 2017, I, probably in a minority of one, thought he could win.\nCorbyn is quite relaxed with a camera around. When we first met, he would ask: \u201cWhat do you want? What should I do?\u201d But now he understands I\u2019m not trying to do photocall pictures; I want it to be as if I wasn\u2019t there.\nArriving at the European Commission in February with (from left) James Schneider, head of strategic communications; Keir Starmer, shadow Brexit secretary; Seumas Milne, director of strategy and communications; and Shami Chakrabarti, shadow attorney general\nTo start with I didn\u2019t have much special access, but over time I persistently asked to follow him. I don\u2019t think the Labour team ever started to trust me, but they did start to tolerate me.\nAbout to be interviewed by ITN\u2019s Angus Walker in the offices of MEP Richard Corbett in the European parliament, with Keir Starmer and Shami Chakrabarti, 21 February\nIn the interview, with Milne and Schneider in the background\nArriving on the Eurostar with Chakrabarti and Richard Burgon, MP for Leeds East\nWith Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, before meeting Theresa May to discuss the Brexit deal, 3 April\nWaiting for the train back to London at Lancaster station, 23 March\nI wasn\u2019t expecting him to do the Eric Morecambe pose. I didn\u2019t suggest it. A member of the public asked to do one with him and then he got Lizzi to do one, too. It was very spontaneous.\nWith Labour councillor Lizzi Collinge earlier in the day\nDoor-to-door canvassing for Morecambe and Lunesdale\nOn the train back to London from Lancaster\nTravelling to south Wales with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, on 30 March, for the byelection campaign following the death of Labour MP Paul Flynn\nCorbyn is much more relaxed and open than his minders from the press team. He said to me once, \u201cOh Sean, are you coming on the train with me?\u201d and suddenly all of his people looked worried; I could see them thinking, \u201cOh no, don\u2019t invite him \u2013 what are you doing?\u201d\nWith local candidate Ruth Jones\nPreparing to go on stage\nMaking notes on a train en route to the Peterborough byelection, 27 April\nHe seems very happy and rejuvenated when he\u2019s on the road and appears to prefer it to being in Westminster: I think he feels it\u2019s a bit of a club, an echo chamber. On the road, he seems genuinely engaged, albeit mostly with Labour party members. Perhaps he should go after a few Tories, too.\nWith new MP Lisa Forbes in the town centre, talking to the press after Labour hold the seat\nWalking home from Finsbury Park station, London, with a member of his team (second left)\nChatting to pearly kings and queens at Armed Forces Day in Islington, north London, in June\nHe\u2019s got more energy than I do. I was with him in Hartlepool one day, back in Islington the next: he couldn\u2019t resist popping into a tiny local street festival where there was an Elvis impersonator. Everyone there wanted to say hello to him, even the police officers.\nWith Elvis at the Manor Gardens street festival near his home\nAt Finsbury Park mosque, as part of the nationwide Visit My Mosque day\nWorking on a speech at the Tolpuddle Martyrs\u2019 festival, Dorset, 20 July\nWhen he\u2019s preparing a speech, he does very brief notes to himself. It seems like he\u2019s writing prompts. In Tolpuddle, he was making his notes in a porch behind the stage, where a musician had left a guitar.\nWith his wife, Laura Alvarez, joining the annual march through the village\nSigning autographs and (right) on the march\nAcknowledging applause following his speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton in September\nI think Corbyn is the only politician I\u2019ve photographed who doesn\u2019t have that lifelong ambition to be prime minister. I\u2019ve never come across anyone like that. All the others, even if there is no possibility of it happening, have that occasional glint in their eye at the thought of \u201cwhat if?\u201d. For him, agree with him or not, it is all about the policies he deeply believes in; it is not about personal ambition. I think even his enemies would agree with that.\nI think he\u2019s a lot more steely and capable than people think. From the little work I\u2019ve done with Boris Johnson, he\u2019s more desperate to be loved than Corbyn; the prime minister seems to get hurt if people don\u2019t like him.\nA walkabout on the seafront\nWith shadow chancellor John McDonnell and (right) waving to the audience with Alvarez\nAddressing the climate emergency demonstration in central London, 20 September\nIt\u2019s become harder to get proper time with politicians.

My mother is an Australian of his generation, who like him came to London in the 1960s and never left, and I grew up on his writing \u2013 Unreliable Memoirs, Falling Towards England, the TV criticism. So I kept asking.\nIn autumn 2015, he was interested. A shortish column with a wide brief was something he thought could work \u2013 but he\u2019d need time to think. He emailed me again a minute later, an email intended for his agent, with a cunning plan to raise the fee and delay the start time, though both, he wrote, were fine. \u201cI want to avoid making close contact with her by voice because I\u2019ll see her viewpoint too easily,\u201d he schemed. Nice try, wrong recipient. He emailed again (subject heading: Clive James says duh), we agreed terms, and promised never to mention it to his agent. Onward, Clive, he signed off, as he did every email thereafter.\nClive wrote about Bake Off (\u201cFormula One with cars you can eat\u201d), night-surfing in Sydney, Adele\u2019s Hello, binge-watching Steven Seagal movies, Wimbledon, Proust, Boris Johnson. He filed at 10am every Wednesday without fail. No column was about any one thing: he skipped from his beloved granddaughter\u2019s birthday to Harry Potter to TS Eliot to an opera star newly recovered from a brain tumour. He loved the limitations of the length (460 words), calling the columns his \u201cbonsai pinadas\u201d: \u201cI just set out to keep you fascinated for the next three minutes and the whole thing goes like a racing dog,\u201d he wrote. His first column got front-page billing, and he trended on Twitter, which delighted him: \u201cThe thrill reminds me of the first time I was ever in print, back there on the Sydney Morning Herald in the early 60s,\u201d he emailed. \u201cHeavens, what fun. Onward, Clive.\u201d\nThere were things we disagreed on \u2013 climate science, and once a column that was a very bad idea whichever way you looked at it. There was a long silence at the other end of the line when I called him to say so. \u201cI see what you mean,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a nice one about a dormouse.\u201d The dormouse was filed the next morning, and who knew that \u201cthere are zillions, threatening to eat the entire country\u201d? He would sometimes resist an edit, or refer it upwards to his wife, Prue, or daughter, Claerwen, who tended to come down on my side; often housebound, he was surrounded by women with opinions, and loving it. There were niggles from Clive\u2019s end, too: he objected to a headline that paraphrased rather than directly quoted, or a subeditor correcting a deliberate mistake. Any references to Guardian house style were enraging.\nHe liked the back-and-forth of editing (\u201cBonzer, I\u2019m SO glad you dig this\u201d), but hated what he saw as meddling. A few months after he started, my boss asked that I move the column towards the front of the magazine \u2013 a more box-office billing. I redesigned the page and showed it to Clive as a courtesy. He was furious: he was staying where he was, at the back, no fuss. The agent was cc\u2019d, this time for real. Clive argued he would lose a quarter of his readers; someone had once taken his TV show off air for a week, and he had lost a million viewers. So he stayed put and maybe he was right: a reader once wrote to say they liked getting to Clive towards the end, like the sugar at the bottom of a cup of tea.\nBy the summer of 2017 he was finding a weekly deadline too exhausting, and decided to quit while he was ahead. Well, almost. He returned to write longer pieces, about The Crown, the NHS, his first crush (Grace Kelly), always thrilled to be writing, and to be read. \u201cYou know I would like to write tons more long pieces but honey, I can barely climb stairs,\u201d he emailed. We last spoke a few weeks ago, when he said he was too tired for the latest piece. \u201cBut thank you for asking and please continue to ask. One day I\u2019ll say yes.\u201d I\u2019m bereft there won\u2019t be more yeses, but what a body of work. And as he once said: \u201cGad, what fun, if a bit tiring.\u201d Onward, Clive.",

        "content": "Finborough, LondonA Welsh teenager is hailed as the second coming in this fascinating revival of Emlyn Williams\u2019 long-forgotten play\nThis enterprising theatre struck gold in 2011 with its revival of Emlyn Williams\u2019s Accolade. They now turn to an earlier Williams work, unseen since its London premiere in 1945, that deals with an outbreak of religious fervour in a Welsh mountain village just after the Crimean war. It\u2019s a weird piece, chiefly fascinating today for what it reveals about Williams himself.\nHe originally played the pivotal figure of Ambrose Ellis, a renegade Welshman who owns a circus in Birmingham and is drawn back to his birthplace by rumours of magic and music in the air. He discovers that a 13-year-old boy is believed to have miraculous powers, which include curing a cholera epidemic, and is thought to be the new Christ. Having arrived as an exploitative businessman, Ellis turns into a dedicated evangelist. Although Williams never explains the credulity of the villagers, the play is intriguing as an exploration of his own guilt: you feel that Williams, who as a successful actor and writer became part of the showbiz world, is expressing his own nostalgia for the Welsh landscape and language, and conceivably his search for a lost faith.\nWill Maynard\u2019s production shrewdly reinforces that feeling by suggesting a post-second world war setting. The performances are also impeccable. Jamie Wilkes as Ellis switches plausibly from sharp-suited showman to devoted disciple and is staunchly supported by David Whitworth as his watchful sidekick, by Rhiannon Neads as a widowed sceptic turned true believer and by Louise Breckon-Richards as the loving mother of the boy messiah. It\u2019s not my favourite Williams piece but it fully deserves revival.\nAt Finborough theatre, London, until 21 December.",

        "content": "Plan is part of \u2018green new deal\u2019 but campaigners say it is not enough to tackle climate crisis\nThe first EU-wide \u201cclimate law\u201d would enshrine a legally binding target of reaching net-zero carbon by 2050, and Europe\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions would be halved by 2030, under a set of proposals being discussed by the incoming European commission.\nCars would be subject to new air pollution standards, following the disastrous cheating that allowed diesel pollutants to be masked, and all vehicles may be brought within the EU\u2019s carbon emissions trading scheme, which would affect drivers across the bloc. Three quarters of road transport would have to be moved to rail and inland waterways, and pricing would have to be adjusted to reflect the carbon output of different modes of transport, which is likely to prove controversial.\nThe proposals are part of the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, the centrepiece of the new commission\u2019s action plan, focused on climate and the environment. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the commission, has pledged to bring forward the proposals within 100 days of taking office on 1 December.\nAccording to a draft seen by the Guardian, moving to zero transport emissions will be a key goal, as will radical reform of the common agricultural policy, which has been widely criticised in recent years for drastic damage to the natural environment. There will be measures for an EU-wide industrial strategy, and innovation funding for promising clean technologies.\nThe central pledge to cut greenhouse gases by \u201cat least 50% and towards 55% in a responsible way\u201d had been long expected, but will not satisfy green campaigners, who say more urgent action is needed. Many measures in the five-page draft are also still vague, missing or hedged with question marks, and many have no firm target date attached.\nMinisters and government officials from around the world are starting to arrive in Madrid for two weeks of difficult negotiations on implementing the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, beginning on Monday. While scientific warnings have grown clearer, countries have stalled on strengthening their emissions-reduction targets to keep up with the Paris goals.\nGreen campaigners criticised the EU\u2019s draft for not going far enough, and said tougher targets should be enacted sooner in order to meet the Paris obligations.\nWendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network, called for the central emissions reduction target to be 65% by 2030, in line with scientific advice on holding temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. He also called for that goal to be set out in the first half of next year, instead of October as planned in the document, to aid international negotiations on the Paris commitments which will reach a conclusion next November.\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s reluctance to propose a new, much higher target early next year shows its failure to recognise the urgency of the climate crisis. Delaying this decision could put the EU in the back seat of global climate negotiations and undermine its role in shaping the discussions on the increase of the targets next year,\u201d Trio said. \u201cIt would be a blow to [the] millions of Europeans who take to the streets demanding immediate action to tackle the climate crisis.\u201d\nThe plan marked an improvement from the priorities of the last commission, said Franziska Achterberg of Greenpeace, but failed to measure up to the scale of change needed.\n\u201cThis is a vast policy programme that marks a shift away from the Juncker commission\u2019s deregulation agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you just have to look beyond the top lines to see that the proposed measures are either too weak, half-baked or missing altogether. Responding to the climate and ecological crises requires a fundamental rethink of the economic system that for decades has rewarded pollution, environmental destruction and human exploitation. This plan barely scratches the surface.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the European parliament voted to declare a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d, which campaigners said would be meaningless if not backed up by strong and swift action.",

        "content": "Former politician had been implicated in disastrous Operation Midland inquiry\nThe former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor has agreed a settlement with the Metropolitan police after being subject to false accusations of child abuse and murder, with reports putting the figure he is due to receive at \u00a3900,000.\nProctor, whose home was raided as part of the disastrous Operation Midland investigation after fictitious claims made by Carl Beech, is to receive \u00a3500,000 in compensation from the Met plus nearly \u00a3400,000 towards his legal costs, according to the Daily Mail.\nWhen contacted by the Guardian about the payout on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Met confirmed that a settlement had been agreed but would not disclose the figure.\nMark Stephensof the law firm Howard Kennedy, which represented Proctor, said the \u00a3900,000 payment was the largest ever made to a complainant who had not gone to prison and was the first time the police had ever \u201cbought off\u201d a claim for negligence.\n\u201cHistorically, the police cannot be sued for negligence but this payment recognises that that [immunity] may be up,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThey recognised that it\u2019s not sustainable where they have been so heavily criticised by a judge.\u201d\nProctor was engaged in an 18-month legal battle with the force.\nOperation Midland, which was conducted by the Met in London from November 2014 to March 2016, investigated several high-profile people over accusations of child sexual abuse and homicide. Other raids were made on the homes of the D-day veteran Lord Bramall and the former home secretary Leon Brittan.\nHowever, the 18-month operation turned out to be based on a series of lies told by Beech, then known as \u201cNick\u201d. Beech had falsely claimed that he and other boys were raped and tortured in the 1970s and 80s by members of a VIP paedophile ring. Brittan died before learning he had been exonerated.\nProctor stated in a high court document that the accusations resulted in him losing his job and home, and caused a \u201cmajor depressive illness\u201d. A key part of the legal action concerned the senior detective Kenny McDonald\u2019s public statement, made during the early stages of the investigation, that Beech\u2019s allegations were \u201ccredible and true\u201d.\nProctor said that \u201celementary research\u201d by the police would have shown Beech\u2019s allegations were false. Beech is now serving an 18-year prison sentence for 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud.\nThe Met was heavily criticised over Operation Midland in an independent review of the case by the former high court judge Sir Richard Henriques.\nHe reprimanded the force for believing Beech for too long, Det Supt McDonald for his \u201ccredible and true\u201d statement, and officers for applying for search warrants with flawed information and for failing to close the investigation sooner.\nEarlier this month, Proctor announced he had reported five former Met officers to Northumbria police in an effort to start a fresh inquiry into the investigation. They include allegations linked to applications for search warrants in Operation Midland and the \u201ccredible and true\u201d statement. Northumbria police has referred the matter back to the Met.\nA spokesman for Scotland Yard said the force was \u201cassessing the complaint\u201d.\nThe police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, found no evidence of misconduct or criminality by the officers during Operation Midland.",

The autonomous region has faced almost six months of intense political unrest due to the growing influence of China. The former British colony is meant to enjoy a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d under the terms of its 1997 handover from the UK, but the Chinese government regards Hong Kong as part of China.\n\u201cIs Hong Kong really becoming Gotham City? But Hong Kong rioters are not Batman. Instead, they are the criminals of Gotham City,\u201d wrote one Weibo user, while others on the Chinese social media platform said they would refuse to buy or support anything from the comics giant in future.\nVariety reported that Chinese internet users linked the flaming bottle to the tactics used by the mainly young protesters in Hong Kong, Batman\u2019s black outfit to the black clothes of the demonstrators, and the titular golden child to the colour yellow, which pro-democracy activists adopted for protests held in Hong Kong five years ago.\n\u201cThe black clothes represent Hong Kong, the mask represents Hong Kong, the Molotov cocktail represents Hong Kong, what else here doesn\u2019t represent Hong Kong???\u201d wrote one reader on Weibo.\nThe image has since been deleted from DC\u2019s social media, although supporters of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong have continued to complain about the removal on its Twitter and Instagram accounts. Late on Wednesday Gramp\u00e1, the comic\u2019s illustrator, shared an image of it and described the controversy as surreal.\nOut in December, The Golden Child sees Carrie Kelley \u201cgrowing into her new role as Batwoman\u201d, but \u201ca terrifying evil has returned to Gotham City\u201d. In order to stop it, Batwoman teams up with Lara Kent, the offspring of Superman and Wonder Woman, along with Lara\u2019s younger brother Jonathan, who is known as \u201cthe golden child\u201d for his strong superpowers.\nThe Guardian has approached DC Comics for comment.",

        "content": "Lee Anderson was subject of complaint from MP over Facebook post last summer\nA Conservative candidate caught on video staging a supposedly impromptu encounter with a constituent was previously the subject of an internal party complaint for posting a sexist comment on Facebook, the Guardian has learned.\nLee Anderson, who is standing in the key Tory target of Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, was exposed by the reporter Michael Crick on Monday after setting up a canvassing encounter with a longtime friend.\nNow the Guardian has established that Anderson, a leave supporter who defected from Labour, has previously faced allegations in both main parties of holding sexist views.\nThe Conservatives were asked by an MP to examine a Facebook post by Anderson in July 2018. It showed a photo of Anderson looking at the chest of a female canvasser in a vest top. He captioned the photo: \u201cOut with some great knockers tonight in Skegby.\u201d\nAnna Soubry, who was then the Conservative MP in the neighbouring constituency of Broxtowe, was made aware of the post and complained to the then party chairman, Brandon Lewis, and other senior officials.\n\u201cLee is an odious sexist,\u201d said Soubry, a remainer who is standing as an independent. \u201cI complained to the highest level of the Conservative party about Lee and his Facebook posting. I specifically spoke to Brandon Lewis and a very senior party worker and I sent a copy of the Facebook posting to another very senior party official. So there is no way they can say that they did not know about this posting many months before he was selected as the candidate.\u201d\nAshfield, a former coalmining community, was once a solid Labour seat but the party\u2019s majority was whittled down to 441 votes at the last election and the area voted heavily to leave the EU.\nIt is now a three-way marginal between Labour, the Tories and a local independent group.\nAnderson, 52, a former miner and Labour councillor, spent the last election working as campaign manager for the outgoing Labour MP Gloria de Piero.\nHe joined the Tories in March last year and was chosen a few weeks ago to stand as their election candidate.\nAnderson was interviewed as a potential Labour district councillor a few months before he joined the Tories but was rejected after making comments in the interview that were alleged to be sexist.\nHe allegedly told a three-person panel that women could not be councillors because of childcare responsibilities. Marje Paling, a member of the panel, said: \u201cHe did not seem to be aware that it might be offensive.\u201d\nAnderson has fallen out with many of his former comrades in the local Labour party. Anne Ayres, the branch secretary for Sutton West in Ashfield, who worked closely with him, said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t engage his brain before opening his mouth.\u201d\nIt emerged on Monday that Anderson was caught by Crick phoning a friend and saying: \u201cI\u2019m knocking at your door in a minute. You know I\u2019m the candidate but I\u2019m not a friend, all right? I\u2019ll see you in a minute.\u201d\nLater, when apparently canvassing, Anderson knocked on the door of a constituent called Steve whom he admitted that he recognised. Steve told Anderson: \u201cI will be going with you. There is no way Labour will ever get my vote.\u201d Crick told Anderson that the interview felt staged.\nLater, when reviewing footage, Crick\u2019s producer realised they had video and audio of Anderson speaking to the constituent on the phone, arranging the door-knock and what they would say.\nAnderson did not respond to a telephone call and a text.\nThe Conservatives have been asked to explain why Anderson was chosen as a candidate and if they had thoroughly investigated Soubry\u2019s complaint.\nConservative sources said the party received no formal complaint but Anderson was warned about his conduct.",

Little wonder, then, that the 73-year-old star is finding a new fanbase in the social media generation, inspiring a raft of fashion collections, TV shows and podcasts.\nThis week Shrimps \u2013 a label known for bubblegum-coloured faux fur coats worn by celebrities such as Alexa Chung \u2013 launched its latest collection, for which Dolly was a key reference. Featuring rodeo prints, wide-brim hats and fringe detailing, the clothes pay homage to the feminised take on western wear with which Parton has long been associated.\n\u201cI particularly love her outfits from the early days,\u201d says the Shrimps designer Hannah Weiland. \u201cShe had such an individual, strong sense of style that has always stayed true to who she is.\u201d\nWeiland is not the only designer influenced by Parton\u2019s retro, glamorous take on cowboy style. This autumn/winter, at Isabel Marant, V-neck dresses were reminiscent of western-style shirts with yoke detailing. At Moschino, jewel-embellished jackets and sequinned minidresses were worn with big, bouffant hair \u2013 a Dolly Parton signature. Dressed up denim \u2013 a Parton staple \u2013 was found at labels including Philipp Plein, while there was shimmering fringing at Alexander McQueen and leather at Victoria/Tomas. Last year, Gucci\u2019s spring/summer show featured a jacket with the singer\u2019s face emblazoned across the back.\nThe big-haired singer will also capitalise on the trend herself. Last week, she told The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon that she would be creating her own line of perfume \u2013 \u201cmaybe called Dolly, I don\u2019t know yet\u201d \u2013 as well as wigs and skincare. \u201cPeople follow me down the street wanting to know what I\u2019m wearing because they love the smell,\u201d she told Fallon. News of Parton\u2019s perfume range follows the announcement this year that the singer would be launching her own clothes, jewellery, accessories and home goods line in partnership with the international agency IMG. Her first collection of apparel and accessories is expected next autumn.\nParton certainly has a captivated audience of potential customers online. On Instagram, where she has 2.2 million followers, she is well known for kitsch throwback posts, such as the photograph of herself and Cher in 1978 with matching gravity-defying hair, captioned \u201ccasual Friday\u201d.\nFashion\u2019s interest reflects growing Dollymania in the wider culture. Last week saw the release of the Netflix anthology series Dolly Parton\u2019s Heartstrings, hot on the heels of the new podcast Dolly Parton\u2019s America.\n\u201cShe obviously has longevity which suddenly seems important in an unstable world,\u201d says the fashion historian Tony Glenville of Parton\u2019s current appeal. \u201cThe ruffled, flounced Grand Ole Opry style is a trend with some designers whose take on the 80s hovers very near saloon girl and country and western.\u201d\nAt a time when fashion is often used as a platform for protest, Parton\u2019s influence may appear somewhat incongruous: the singer has long refused to speak out on political issues as well as, more recently, the #MeToo movement. Yet, as the New York Times noted in its own assessment of Parton\u2019s recent renaissance, \u201cthe attributes that used to set her up for criticism \u2013 the outrageous, hyper-femme style \u2026 the so-what acknowledgment of her own cosmetic surgery \u2013 are no longer taboo.\u201d",

        "content": "After ignoring the climate crisis for decades, political parties have now filled their manifestos with environmental pledges. It is important to assess how effective these pledges would be.\nOur research \u2013 to be presented at the British Ecological Society\u2019s meeting in Belfast on 11 December, a day before the election \u2013 shows that two solutions are effective in addressing environmental concerns. These are comprehensive Green New Deal plans which, alongside \u201cgreen growth\u201d, also stop fossil fuel subsidies and implement progressive green taxes. Nature-based solutions are also effective: these restore and better manage habitats such as forests and coastal ecosystems. The environment benefits most when both strategies are combined, and can also benefit society by, for example, reducing inequity.\nFor the main three UK-wide parties\u2019 manifestos, Labour comes out the best, with a comprehensive \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d alongside some commitments to nature-based solutions. Next come the Liberal Democrats, with a greater commitment to reforesting, but weaker societal reforms than Labour. Last come the Conservatives, with weaker nature-based solutions than the Lib Dems, and a strong focus on economic growth, which we demonstrate decreases the environmental benefits of any other policies.\nOverall, however, the Green party\u2019s policies are the best, covering Green New Deal principles, committing to nature-based solutions and refocusing economic performance away from the measurement of growth.\nThese manifesto pledges from the Greens were put to the Commons in March 2019 in the decarbonisation and economic strategy bill. So, to protect the environment, a good question to ask your prospective MPs would be whether they would support this bill\u2019s progress if it were reintroduced in the next parliament.\nProf Rick Stafford, Dr Elena Cantarello, Elli Rivers, Abigail Croker, Tilak Ginige, Prof Chris Shiel Bournemouth University; Dr Emma McKinley Cardiff University; Dr Peter JS Jones University College London\n Two chilling reports this week from the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Environment Programme both show that carbon emissions haven\u2019t yet peaked, let alone begun the necessary decline needed to prevent climate chaos (UN urges drastic cut in emissions over next decade to avert disaster, 26 November).\nThe former government chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, was incredibly blunt about the implications, warning that we ought to be afraid, not least because of the potential sea level rise of one or two metres, which would mean London having to be moved to higher ground.\nParticularly striking was Sir David\u2019s concern at the lack of political leadership to seriously tackle these problems. The Conservative manifesto was pitifully weak on ideas and spending plans to tackle the climate crisis. Take the crucially important area of our homes. The Tories promise a paltry \u00a36.3bn to make them more energy-efficient, which will do next to nothing to tackle the crisis. Compare this with the hundreds of billions needed, and promised in the Green party\u2019s Green New Deal, to decarbonise every aspect of our economy and society over the next decade.\nThe country has already endured a decade of cruel Conservative austerity. We cannot afford to now add recklessness on climate to the social deprivation this has already created. The choice on 12 December is stark yet simple. If you are worried about the future of the planet, our nation\u2019s children and grandchildren and those around the world already affected by the climate crisis, then vote for a party that is committed to doing something about it. If not now, when? Caroline LucasGreen party parliamentary candidate for Brighton Pavilion\n George Monbiot\u2019s article (A vote for the planet means a vote for Labour or the Greens, Journal, 27 November) makes an interesting point about the contradictions in Labour\u2019s manifesto policies to address the climate crisis.\nThese contradictions have far-reaching consequences. Take Labour\u2019s conditional support for airport expansion. Their \u201ccase by case\u201d approach means that up and down the country, local authorities are left to struggle with planning applications for individual airport expansion plans. Up and down the country, groups and individuals concerned by this have to spend weeks and months, arguing the case against \u2013 and all within the constraints of the local planning process, which was never set up as a means of tackling the climate emergency.\nIn the midst of a global climate crisis there is nothing local about airport expansion. It is a national issue which demands a national policy against any UK airport expansion.Tony JonesBristol \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Shall we have a debate about whether Joe Root should carry on as England\u2019s Test captain? OK, I\u2019ll start. The answer is, no. Of course not. Time to give up, concentrate on being a brilliant batsman and give someone else a go. The end.\nUnfortunately, a question this clear-cut does present some formal problems when it comes to writing a column. It is necessary at this point to whistle nonchalantly and glance down at the open white spaces below this line, like a man in a crowded lift staring with furious feigned interest at the spa treatment times.\nPerhaps we could fill a little space by talking about the rest of England\u2019s top order. For example, Dominic Sibley and his brilliantly puritanical offside leave, a shot that sees him actually turn his back and make his bat disappear into his body, like a spy hiding behind a lamppost.\nOr how about Rory Burns and that habit of turning his head to looking past the bowler towards mid-on, the way a cat sits at an angle when it\u2019s cross with you. Burns does this to favour his stronger left eye, raising the idea, as suggested in various scientific batting studies, that he is actually a right-hander, just one whose batting has been bent by that initial misconception into a series of awkward compensatory shapes, like a footballer who can\u2019t stop doing the Rabona.\nWe could talk about the country as a whole, the way the notion of the England captain as a semi-honorific role speaks to so many other offices and structures that seem stuck, sclerotic, bound by cobwebs \u2013 and indeed occupied by the wrong person.\nPut like that, the idea of discussing Root and the Test captaincy suddenly becomes a great deal more appealing. Go on then. Why should Root stop being England Test captain? Firstly because he\u2019s not very good at it.\nThis is not a slight on Root. Captaincy is clearly very difficult. Sometimes it can just come down to a look, a way of standing and talking, a sense of chasing and finding your own luck. There was a shiver of hope on the opening morning in Hamilton as Root clung on to that early slip catch off Jeet Raval like it was the last piece of golden moon rock left in the world. A little later there was a lovely grab to get rid of Kane Williamson and it was almost a shock to see Root smiling and leaping about, to remember what a fun, uplifting presence he is.\nAt which point things began to fall away a little. Root\u2019s England began this game with no wicketkeeper and no spinner. Root\u2019s England won the toss and bowled, but slowly and without vim. Root\u2019s England risked wrecking their star all-rounder by having him pound in with a knee injury. And as ever there seemed to be no plan, no cranial buzz, no eye for the tides and currents of the day.\nThis has been the tone of the age of Root: formulaic stasis interspersed with formulaic funkiness. We\u2019re going to smash it. No! We\u2019re going to bat like a jug of cold custard. At times during the first Test this feeling of category-confusion seemed to combine into something else, lethargy, exhaustion, even disinterest.\nThe real clincher is that England lose Root the great batsman to gain Root the poor captain. This is a player who at his best has a kind of unscarred grace, a thrilling lightness of touch in his movements and his contact with the ball.\nAnd yet from May to September this year Root was gouging his way through 24 international matches across three formats, with the full insomnia of Ashes captaincy duties thrown in. By the time the second Test came around he was wandering out to bat like a man about to be buried up to his neck and left for the desert ants.\nThis is unsurprising. Even the \u201cdebate\u201d around this topic is draining and tiresome. This is the real point here. Why do we still fetishise the Test captaincy, building it up as a six-year legacy role, all shot through with shades of empire, as though doing the toss and going to some meetings is like being appointed crown ambassador to the Commonwealth.\nThere is a feeling of impropriety in even pointing out the obvious fact that Root isn\u2019t the best option. Who else is there, Root\u2019s friends ask? The answer to which is: anyone and everyone else in the team. Give it to Burns for a year, a contracted player and successful captain, but deemed by some, with an absurd deference to the role, to be not quite England material just yet.\nGive it to Ben Stokes, who already leads in everything he does, who won\u2019t be destroyed by this any more than he already destroys himself anyway, and willingly. Give it to Stuart Broad, who has some matches left in him, not to mention brains and a powerful sense of his own worth.\nThe discussion around why, when and with what level of ceremony the England Test captain should be sacked has always been one of the defining elements of the England Test captaincy. Why not dilute it at the source. Take away the selection elements, and anything else that might affect the doling out of those lucrative central contracts. Make the captain\u2019s own position renewable every year too.\nDial it back and we might just be doing everyone a favour. Not least Root the player, who is the real story here, and who just needs to go back to being brilliantly unencumbered, to casting his light on this team not trying to remake it.",

It has also diverted Kurdish fighters away from operations combatting Islamic State.\nThe US president, under huge domestic and political pressure, has held back from withdrawing all remaining US troops from north-east Syria, and instead tried to negotiate a halt to Turkish activity. Turkey\u2019s operation seems to be on hold, except for clashes in two strategic towns, Tal Tamr and Ain Issa.\nLeading European powers, the UK, France and Germany, will meet with Erdo\u011fan in Downing Street on Tuesday ahead of the main Nato leaders\u2019 meeting on Wednesday. Trump is not due to attend, although he is scheduled to be in London.\nBut Erdo\u011fan said in advance of the meeting: \u201cI\u2019m addressing Mr Macron from Turkey and I will say it at Nato: you should check whether you are brain dead first.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not up to Macron to discuss whether Turkey should stay in Nato or should be expelled.\u201d\n\u201cI have explained to him the threats we are facing from Syria many times. But he never understood. Believe me, he is so inexperienced. He does not know what the fight against terror is. That\u2019s why the \u2018yellow vests\u2019 [Gilet Jaunes] movement has occupied almost all of France. He failed to deliver the right of his own citizens.\u201d\nErdo\u011fan also questioned the motives behind the French military presence in Syria: \u201cWhat are you doing there? You have no right to be present there. You have not been invited by the regime either.\u201d\nEurope has been unable to deliver a no-fly zone across northern Syria, and plans for a European force floated by the German defence ministry have not come to fruition.\nErdo\u011fan believes the Kurdish YPG, the backbone of the US-backed local forces that defeated Isis in northern Syria, are synonymous with what he regards as Kurdish terror groups operating inside Turkey.\nHe wants a statement from Nato condemning the YPG as a terrorist organisation, and will veto a separate Nato strategy aimed at combatting Russia in the Baltics unless he has Nato\u2019s endorsement of his strategy.\nErdo\u011fan also warned the US and Russia, with which Turkey made two separate conditional agreements for the termination of its military operations against the YPG in north-east Syria. The deal required a withdrawal of YPG troops from certain areas, and Erdo\u011fan said he cannot tolerate the current impasse forever.\nErdo\u011fan believes he can isolate Macron at the summit, pointing to indications of support from the UK and Germany. Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, said the UK had advised Turkey against its invasion due to the humanitarian consequences, but said it would be a major strategic blunder to drive Turkey into the arms of Russia.",

Mid Wales Opera\u2019s new production is a cheeky take on John Gay\u2019s The Beggar\u2019s Opera. If Weill and Brecht based their Threepenny Opera on it, then, reasoned MWO\u2019s Richard Studer, he could have fun too. Studer\u2019s original was a one-woman show spotlighting the lady \u2013 though she\u2019s no lady, more madam and scheming murderess \u2013 but became a three-hander with daughter Polly Peachum (a fetching portrayal by Alys Mererid Roberts) and servant Filch (Johnny Herford), who steals the authorial framing.\nWhat? No Macheath? Afficionados of Gay and Weill will be horrified. Yet the highwayman \u2013 the lovable rogue secretly married to Polly and in thieving league with her father \u2013 manages to be a presence throughout, thanks to the gibbet and noose standing ready to hang him. He\u2019s clearly the mainstay of Polly\u2019s existence.\nAs Studer made free with the plot, so his fellow artistic director Jonathan Lyness felt able to do likewise with what, as one of the earliest ballad operas, was a bit of a creative free-for-all. The wit and ingenuity of Lyness\u2019s music, scored for piano, violin, bassoon and percussion, allows it to flow in and out of the spoken dialogue with consummate ease.\nStill full of sharp social comment \u2013 albeit some of Gay\u2019s bons mots occasionally lost in the Irish inflections of Carolyn Dobbin\u2019s Mrs P \u2013 what is missing is Gay\u2019s element of biting political satire.

It seems like a bad solution in search of the wrong problem.\u201d\nThe economist Jonathan Portes, of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, said the policies meant the Tory party had put forward \u201cits most protectionist manifesto for a century\u201d.\nJohnson made the announcement at a press conference where he was flanked by two of his senior colleagues from the Vote Leave campaign \u2013 Michael Gove, now a cabinet minister, and former Labour MP Gisela Stuart.\nStuart used her speech at the event to urge longtime Labour voters to \u201cset party allegiance aside to get Brexit done\u201d and support Johnson on 12 December.\n\u201cI say to these traditional Labour voters who three and a half years ago voted to leave, that we can bring the country back together again, and we can unite, but that is not by voting for Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d she said.\nLabour has promised to negotiate its own Brexit deal \u2013 which it would then put to a referendum.\nBut party insiders have acknowledged they face a tough battle to hang on to a string of heartland seats across the Midlands and the north of England.\nStuart, who once represented Birmingham Edgbaston, said she still held Labour values, but her old party had deserted her under Corbyn.\n\u201cWhilst my values have not changed, the same cannot be said of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party,\u201d she said, bemoaning the absence of what she called \u201cthe moderate, pragmatic and fair-minded politics that has been characteristic of Labour in all my political life\u201d.\n\u201cThe Labour party of Tony Blair, John Smith and Gordon Brown has gone, at least for now,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cVoting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now, or in the future.\u201d",

        "content": "Adel Abdul Mahdi bows to pressure following 50 deaths in latest security crackdown\nIraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, has announced his resignation, bowing to the country\u2019s top cleric and relentless pressure from protesters demanding the fall of his government and an end to rampant corruption.\nIt was greeted with both jeers and relief on the country\u2019s unsettled streets, which were this week convulsed by a deadly crackdown by security forces that killed nearly 50 people and edged Iraq closer to a widespread collapse in security.\nAbdul Mahdi\u2019s resignation, announced on Friday, is due to be discussed at a parliamentary session on Sunday convened to discuss the crisis. It follows a six-week popular uprising aimed at the heart of Iraq\u2019s establishment, which many across the centre and south of the country say long ago ceased to serve citizens and instead used oil revenues to enrich themselves.\nIn office for just over a year, the veteran politician had vowed to stay on in the face of a lethal Iranian-backed pushback against the uprising, which has led to almost 400 deaths since it broke out on 1 October. However, an unusually strident demand from Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani that Iraq\u2019s legislature consider Abdul Mahdi\u2019s position appeared to cut further room for manoeuvre.\nSistani, who weighs in on politics only in times of crisis and wields huge influence over public opinion, warned on Friday against an explosion of civil strife and tyranny. He urged government forces to stop killing protesters and told demonstrators to reject all violence.\nThe intensity of the protests had taken on a revolutionary zeal that the country\u2019s well-armed military was struggling to contain even as it deployed overwhelming force against unarmed demonstrators.\nSuch has been the momentum of near-daily demonstrations that the very future of post-Saddam Hussein Iraq has been repeatedly placed in question. Until earlier in the week, Iraqi officials believed they had countered calls to topple the leadership and contained the growth of the protests. Up to 200,000 people had taken part in the demonstrations, led by a large disenfranchised working class and joined by some of the middle classes.\nBut the burning by protesters of the Iranian consulate in Najaf on Wednesday and the deadly crackdown that followed in the southern city of Nassiriya, in which 45 people were killed over the following 48 hours, sparked a new fervour. The governor of Dhi Qar province resigned in response, saying: \u201cIt is a dishonour to be part of this system that kills the people of my own country.\u201d\nKarrar Moussawi, a resident of Baghdad, said: \u201cI went out to the protests after 16 years of my people calling out for government reforms and a change in the status quo.\n\u201cHow is it that we are one of the richest countries and our people are broke? How is it that we still don\u2019t have access to water though we have two major rivers? We have high unemployment, corruption, no services and they still have the guts to fire at us when we protest.\u201d\nBaraa Abdel Mutaleb, a professor and feminist rights activist in Najaf, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a maddening dictatorship. We are calling for change. The quality of life and the standard is very poor.\n\u201cDespite that, we\u2019re not calling for funds or money to come our way while we\u2019re sitting at home. We\u2019re calling for more than that: the infrastructure is garbage, no electricity, the government is practically nonexistent in practical form. They\u2019re attacking our dignity. From yesterday till today, all these corpses.\u201d\nIraqi security leaders had believed that the attack on the Iranian consulate and advances by demonstrators towards one of Shia Islam\u2019s most important shrines in Karbala had licensed them to take even harsher measures against the protest movement. However, they appeared to underestimate the defiance of communities who, after nearly two months of unrest, had nothing to gain by submitting to force now.\n\u201cWhat happened yesterday was chaotic,\u201d said Ahmad al-Akayshi of Najaf. \u201cThe protestors tried to reach the burial area of Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, and they set fire around the area. Security forces began firing at the protesters but they were overwhelmed as the numbers of the protesters grew far more than the forces.\u201d\nMustafa, 37, from Nasiriyah, said: \u201cIt was a massacre. They were using heavy machine guns on the protesters. It was like a war. People are only asking for their rights, and they protest, but the government forces treat them as terrorists.\n\u201cThe government has too much blood of innocent people on their hands; nothing will wash it away after this. Everyone involved in this massacre should be tried publicly. They are firing teargas and smoke grenades at the people, and it has injured hundreds. There isn\u2019t enough to take care of these people.\n\u201cBodies were lying on the ground like in a battlefield. It was a massacre. They didn\u2019t show any mercy to the people who are only marching with a flag in their hands, asking for a better life.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Mohammed Rasool",

The Golden Egg is the trophy awarded to the winners of the keenly fought rivalry game.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not who we are,\u201d Matt Luke, Rebels coach, told reporters after the game, skirting the fact that it is only two years since an Ole Miss player was penalised for precisely the same thing.\nMississippi State is bowl eligible because Ole Miss pretended to be a peeing dog pic.twitter.com/mZ0f13Z4Nd\nIn 2017, receiver DK Metcalf celebrated a touchdown by mimicking a micturating mutt and was penalised the same way, losing 15 yards. Ole Miss hung on to win that game, 31-28, thereby taking the Golden Egg back to Oxford.\nMetcalf was apparently copying NFL star Odell Beckham Jr, who also incurred a 15-yard penalty during a game for the New York Giants against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nBeckham explained himself thus: \u201cI\u2019m in the end zone. I\u2019m a dog. So I acted like a dog.\u201d He was fined a little over $12,000.\nOn Thursday night, Luke said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been a disciplined team all year, and so just disappointed that happened. That\u2019s not who he is. Elijah is a good kid, and he just got caught up in the moment.\u201d\nLuke said he knew that as emotions flared showboating would need to be avoided.\n\u201cWe talked about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had five penalties. We just wanted to play a clean game. Nothing after the whistles or before the whistles was going to help us win the ballgame.\u201d\nOle Miss quarterback John Rhys Plumlee told the Oxford Eagle: \u201cWhen you\u2019re excited and you make a big play, you celebrate a little bit. That call just didn\u2019t go our way \u2026 It\u2019s an emotional game and that\u2019s part of it sometimes.\u201d",

        "content": "My friend Robert Silver, who has died aged 63 of pulmonary disease, had various lines of work, as a researcher, a lawyer and a journalist, but was characterised above all by a gift for friendship and a generosity of spirit.\nHe enjoyed a glittering heyday as an undergraduate, with impressive social and intellectual talents, but his later life was affected by mental illness, with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. However, he was never unduly downcast or embittered, and enjoyed the support of a nucleus of devoted friends.\nBorn in London into a prosperous Jewish family, Robert was the son of Eva (nee Alexander) and Geoffrey Silver, the owner of a pickled-food company. His early terrain of Kensington encouraged an easy-going social mode, propelled by cigarettes and inquisitiveness. A lifelong passion for history took root at St Paul\u2019s boys\u2019 school, and flourished at Cambridge University, where I met him and where he headed the student Fabian Society.\nAfter graduating in 1977, he embarked on a career as a freelance journalist while studying law for bar exams at City University. Some of his articles on politics were published in the New Statesman, but the life of a freelancer proved difficult. After being called to the bar in 1983, he decided that career was also not for him. Robert\u2019s foothold in a conventional world of achievement was precarious, but such formal expectations were alien to him anyway.\nHe began a PhD at Cambridge on politics and opinion in the 1930s, but felt somewhat isolated in comparison with his undergraduate experience. After that research was abandoned, his health started to fray, and he was hospitalised on several occasions. Throughout, he robustly challenged the terms of the Mental Health Act. He continued to be supported by his many friends, now mainly through conversations on his landline telephone (never taking to a mobile device), where he remained convivial despite his circumstances.\nEveryone who knew Robert has a residue of fond memories, tapping into that distinctive youthful mixture of fun, adventure and subversiveness. My favourite image is of Robert dancing vigorously, half-gigolo, half-dervish, at my parents\u2019 wedding anniversary party with a succession of female guests, to the surprise of their seated husbands. Spontaneous, mildly perplexing, slightly transgressive: those were the marks of a personality unbound.\nRobert is survived by a brother, David, and two nieces, Natasha and Sophie.",

        "content": "The Coalition thought they had it in the bag, but a last-minute manoeuvre from Pauline Hanson left them in shock\nIt was only a matter of weeks after the Morrison government secured its shock election victory that it got down to work on reintroducing its union-busting bill.\nOn 4 July the Coalition reintroduced the Ensuring Integrity legislation and by August employer groups had the distinct impression from One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts \u2013 who normally takes the lead on industrial relations issues \u2013 that his party was solidly behind it.\nWith One Nation\u2019s two votes seemingly in the bag, along with that of Cory Bernardi, the government only needed independent Jacqui Lambie or Centre Alliance\u2019s two votes to give it the victory which would see new powers to deregister unions and disqualify their officials.\nEither or both seemed viable \u2013 Lambie suggested the bill would pass if militant construction unionist John Setka did not quit and Centre Alliance began to pursue amendments.\nBut behind the scenes something was happening.\nA lengthy three-month Senate committee process bought the Australian Council of Trade Unions time to fight a rearguard action against the bill, which culminated in a stunning victory on Thursday when Lambie, Roberts and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson voted against the bill.\nIn her Senate contribution on Wednesday Hanson credited her interest in the bill to an \u201cearly dialogue with the unions \u2026 initiated by central Queensland union member Chris Brodsky\u201d, which led to \u201cworthwhile discussions\u201d with 10 union bodies in total.\nBrodsky, a Queensland official from the mining and energy branch of the Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union, tells Guardian Australia he first met Hanson in late August or early September in Rockhampton and put her in touch with state secretary Michael Ravbar, among others.\nBrodsky \u2013 who continued to call Hanson\u2019s office in the months leading up to the vote \u2013 says he was as surprised as everybody else when the party voted the bill down.\nHe insists Hanson was genuinely persuaded after \u201ctaking the time to understand what the bill would do to unions\u201d, adding that the accusation Westpac had breached anti-money laundering provisions 23m times \u201cwouldn\u2019t have helped\u201d.\n\u201cIt was high on the agenda in the community and public opinion that there wasn\u2019t an even playing field,\u201d he says.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want multi-millionaires breaking the law and nothing happens. If they\u2019re ensuring integrity for unions \u2013 it needs to be in place for companies as well.\u201d\nWith Hanson engaged on the issue, One Nation started to have substantive discussions with the unions about ways the bill overreached.\nAlthough Labor under Bill Shorten was strident in its opposition to everything One Nation stood for, the Australian Council of Trade Unions under Sally McManus never lost touch with the minor party. Anthony Albanese is also open-minded, and while many Labor MPs and senators are still not on speaking terms with them, others have built bridges with Hanson.\nBy mid-October, Hanson was throwing her weight around on the dairy code of conduct threatening to block other bills and winning Labor support. While the Coalition caved on that issue, union leaders saw an opportunity in the rocky relationship between the government and One Nation.\nThe attorney general Christian Porter was in the market for a deal so when the Senate committee delivered a report detailing Centre Alliance demands for a new demerit point system to lift the threshold for disqualification, he agreed.\nOn 20 November Porter told the National Press Club he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to Lambie\u2019s support because although Setka had been ejected from Labor he had refused to quit the union movement.\nIn retrospect employer groups see this as a fatal misstep, assuming Lambie would fall into line. Lambie reports the government \u201cwouldn\u2019t even talk to me\u201d about her proposed amendments to the bill \u2013 which would have exempted industrial action from the list of conduct that can trigger deregistration.\nOn 29 November Hanson set a high price for One Nation support, but Porter agreed to both Centre Alliance and One Nation amendments, setting up the path to pass the bill in the penultimate sitting week of the year.\nPublicly, Hanson twice took to Sky News to warn the government not to rush the bill and it could not take her support for granted. But privately, the government was reassured that they had a deal and between Centre Alliance and One Nation there would be no need for Lambie\u2019s vote.\nThe ACTU brought a large contingent of unionists from its many non-construction affiliates to Canberra, seeking to hammer home the point that the bill was bigger than Setka and the CFMMEU, that unions were at risk of deregistration for campaigns such as advocating nurse-to-patient ratios or fighting asbestos company James Hardie.\nIn the dying days, they flooded the crossbench with 45,000 emails from workers urging the bill be blocked.\nCentre Alliance stopped taking meetings with the unions when they started running ads against them, but One Nation never did. Both minor parties supported an hours motion to ensure everyone could have their say on the bill with a final vote on Thursday.\nRoberts and Hanson\u2019s Senate contributions were cryptic. While Roberts warned against union-bashing, he also blasted \u201crogue\u201d union officials and said \u201cit\u2019s time for improved accountability and for integrity\u201d.\nHanson said it was \u201cironic\u201d parliament was debating ensuring the integrity of unions but not multinational companies, suggesting there was \u201cone rule for white collar crimes and a much harsher [rule]\u201d for blue-collar crimes. But she also stressed the improvements One Nation had made to the bill, and appeared to blame unions for complex awards.\nWhen the bells began ringing at 4.30pm on Thursday, everything was still going to plan for the government with One Nation and Centre Alliance amendments voted up, and Greens and Lambie amendments going down, with the exception of a review of the bill.\nBut when it came to the crucial final vote, Hanson and Roberts crossed the floor to vote with Labor, the Greens and Lambie, helping defeat the bill in a 34-all tie.\nGovernment leader in the Senate Mathias Cormann looked down at his phone as the bells rang out, while social services minister Anne Ruston was similarly stunned. \u201cThanks Malcolm [Roberts]!\u201d exclaimed one bitter Coalition senator after the result was declared.\nLabor senator Catryna Bilyk shepherded Hanson back to her office, shocked but grateful. Hanson explained to her that One Nation had voted on the bill\u2019s merit.\nAt a jubilant press conference, ACTU president Michele O\u2019Neil warned the government would be \u201chumiliated\u201d if it brought the bill back.\nLabor\u2019s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, said it was clear the government had spent \u201cmore time defending [embattled environment minister] Angus Taylor than convincing the crossbench\u201d.\nBoth the ACTU and One Nation ruled out any form of quid pro quo, with Hanson insisting she would \u201cnever base [her] vote on that\u201d.\nBut since Setka himself has warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d for those who voted for the bill, every crossbench senator knows the union movement will campaign fiercely against supporters of the bill. There is now an expectation of union forbearance towards One Nation at the Queensland state election, due in October 2020, although not positive support.\nOn Friday Porter stopped short of accusing Hanson of breaking a promise to the government but said it was \u201cexceedingly strange\u201d they had rejected the bill, adding that he had made an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d in assuming the negotiations were conducted in good faith. He bluntly rejected all of the purported reasons offered by Hanson for the party\u2019s backdown.\n\u201cWe accepted everything that Pauline had asked for in the process,\u201d Porter said. The issue of administrators taking over unions \u201cwas never raised\u201d in weeks of negotiations.\nNow the question is whether One Nation will stick to its guns. Hanson said the issue should be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d of unions and if the bill is reintroduced she will \u201cassess it at the time\u201d and her vote is \u201cnot guaranteed the next time\u201d.\nBecause of those comments, some say this week\u2019s decision is merely a stay of execution.\nBut Brodsky seems confident. \u201cPersonally, I think they\u2019ll stick to their guns on this one,\u201d he says. \u201cI congratulated Pauline [after the vote] on behalf of all union members who are now protected.\n\u201cShe still has reservations about unions but I think she recognises the majority do a good job the majority of the time.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming to realise that the word \u2018union\u2019 isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d",

        "content": "The Guardian travelled the length of the Whanganui in New Zealand to investigate whether new legal protections will make a difference\nAdam Daniel wades waist deep through the glassy water. Pumice stones spiral in the shallow eddy, while the shrill whistles of a male whio (blue duck) echo upstream through the green canyon walls. The mountain stream\u2019s deep current slows around a lone tree standing on a small rocky island before rushing toward the sea.\nLike a doctor, Daniel spends the morning checking the pulse of the river\u2019s upper arteries, taking temperature readings and drawing water samples to diagnose its vitality. Thirty kilometres to his south-east, the Whanganui River\u2019s pristine headwaters begin in the internationally renowned Tongariro National Park, on the western flanks of three cone volcanoes, Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngauruhoe.\nFrom there the river carves through two national parks, a national forest, farmland, two large towns and many smaller communities on its journey 260km to the south, where it empties into the Tasman Sea.\nBut the body of water flowing past Daniel is more than a geographical feature. Granted personhood in 2017 by an act of the New Zealand parliament, the Whanganui is the first river in the world to be recognised as an indivisible and living being.\nThe M\u0101ori tribes that live along the Whanganui have always seen the river as sacred \u2013 its waters have nourished and blessed the people throughout the 700 years they have lived beside it. The law set in motion new intentions to uphold the mana (prestige) and mauri (life force) of the river.\nYet despite the river\u2019s new legal status, it still faces challenges from farming and forestry to dams and development. And Daniel \u2013 a biologist charged with monitoring river habitat health \u2013 is troubled with recent temperature and clarity readings.\nThe river is sick, and he needs to know where the illness begins.\n \nSpring rain cascades down the Ngapuwaiwaha Marae\u2019s decorative roofline in Taumarunui, the first large town the Whanganui River meets. Hundreds gather at 8am to celebrate the river, the new act and the inauguration of the two people selected to speak on behalf of the river: Dame Tariana Turia, an influential M\u0101ori political leader, and Turama Hawira, an experienced M\u0101ori advisor and educator.\nVisitors await the powhiri, a ritual welcoming people to the marae, a fenced-in complex of carved buildings belonging to a particular tribe.\nAs the rain subsides, Gerrard Albert steps up to the microphone. He is one in a long line of leaders who have fought for recognition of their deep relationship to the river since the 1840 signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand\u2019s founding document. He addressed the crowd in M\u0101ori and then in English.\n\u201cThe settlement legislation recognises Te Awa Tupua as this: a living and indivisible whole comprising the Whanganui River from the mountains to the sea, incorporating its tributaries and all its physical and metaphysical elements,\u201d Albert says. \u201cFor the first time, a framework stems from the intrinsic spiritual values of an indigenous belief system.\u201d\nWhen the New Zealand parliament passed the Te Awa Tupua Act granting the Whanganui River system legal personhood, the decision sent waves across the globe, settling the longest water dispute in the nation\u2019s history and establishing a unique legal framework rooted in the M\u0101ori worldview of the Whanganui tribes, who revere the river as a tupuna, or ancestor.\nThe law begins by recognising the river as an indivisible and living being called Te Awa Tupua and outlines four core principles from the tribes\u2019 perspective, including their inalienable connection to the river. Then, it states this being \u201chas all the rights, powers, duties and liabilities of a legal person\u201d.\nTom Barraclough, a legal researcher and expert on the Te Awa Tupua law, says the legislation will give tribes \u201csignificant influence\u201d over the future of the river. \u201cAs a consequence of giving iwi greater rights, there may be greater protection for nature.\u201d\nDr Erin O\u2019Donnell, a senior fellow at the University of Melbourne law school and author of a book on river rights, agrees. \u201cThe act shifts us away from this resource construction where we ask, \u2018what do we want from the river?\u2019 and into a space where we can say, \u2018what do we want for the river and how do we get there with the river?\u2019\u201d\nOver the course of six months, the Guardian travelled the Whanganui to investigate the impact of the new protections \u2013 and good intentions.\n\u201cYou are defining, essentially, the river\u2019s rights,\u201d Albert says.\u201cIt puts the river at the centre of the picture and asks us to organise around it.\u201d\nThis view isn\u2019t unique in the larger legal framework of New Zealand. In 2014, New Zealand gave the same rights to a former national park, Te Urewera, and soon after Mount Taranaki as well.\nThe trend has also taken hold outside the country. In February 2019, citizens of Toledo, Ohio, granted legal rights to Lake Erie \u2013 a fight that began after a 2014 toxic algae bloom shut down city water for three days. India recognised the Ganges and Yamuna rivers as legal entities in 2017, but those rights were overturned. In July 2019, Bangladesh joined suit and granted all of its rivers this same status. And in September the Yurok Tribe in California granted personhood to the Klamath River.\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether it will work. In the case of Te Awa Tupua, the hard work lies downstream, where the river and its branches encounter development, farming, forestry and run-off which challenge its health and ecology.\nWater woes are not unique to the Whanganui River - similar concerns exist across the country. A 600-page Waitangi Tribunal report released last August criticised the government\u2019s Resource Management Act for allowing \u201ca serious degradation of water to occur in many ancestral water bodies\u201d. It highlighted the government\u2019s failure to recognise M\u0101ori rights and interests in water. It recommends sweeping changes for both.\nToday, those gathered in Taumarunui are celebrating the first step, as the two voices of the river begin meeting with the communities along it to build a strategy that addresses the body of water as an indivisible whole. However, Albert says the law will take years to have an impact.\n Near the river\u2019s source at Tongariro National Park, Dave Pickett looks below the surface of the Mangatepopo Stream with a bathyscope. Knee deep in the swift current of this Whanganui tributary, he measures small bugs and algae life clinging to the river bottom, one gauge of a river\u2019s health. He shouts numbers to his colleague.\nThe men are conducting ecology assessments for Genesis Energy, the company that operates the Tongariro Power Scheme that provides 4% of New Zealand\u2019s energy. The hydropower system diverts the water of the Whanganui River and five of its upper tributaries, including the Mangatepopo. Pickett surveys the stream\u2019s health above and below an intake structure which draws 75% of the water, leaving 25% to flow back into the river. The intake is just outside the park, 15km from the stream\u2019s source and 15km from its confluence with the Whanganui.\nThe contractors join Campbell Speedy, the environmental coordinator and ecologist working for Genesis. He knows bugs, fish, ecology and the watershed. And he understands the environmental impacts of energy development and the complex cultural landscape of the river.\n\u201cThis landscape behind us here is Tongariro National Park,\u201d Speedy says. \u201cIt\u2019s got dual world heritage status, not only for its volcanic landscape but for its cultural landscape. The water\u2019s coming off a pristine environment. It doesn\u2019t get much better than what we\u2019re seeing right here.\u201d\nBut like Daniel, Speedy knows the river faces complex issues downstream.\nNew Zealand\u2019s clean, green image has been mired with reports signalling major water quality issues in many of its rivers. In particular, water quality data from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research shows the lower Whanganui River is often badly contaminated with fecal bacteria and fine sediment from extensive farming on its steep slopes and on the slopes of many of its tributaries.\nIn addition to these threats, many point the finger at hydropower.\nSince the 1970s the power scheme has harnessed energy from these rivers, often leaving the river beds dry below the intakes. In 2004, when Genesis was granted rights to use this water for 35 more years, it came with stipulations requiring the company to keep a certain amount of water in the Whanganui and Mangatepopo. The minimum flows were set to a level to maximise whio food production and food access. Speedy says this aimed to improve the ecology of the Mangatepopo stream and the Whanganui River \u2013 leading to healthy levels of bugs and algae, and a water level optimal for the ducks to thrive.\nThese methods and serious predator eradication programs are working. Speedy says 500 of New Zealand\u2019s 3,000 blue ducks are in this watershed, four times more than in 2001.\nYet the scheme\u2019s viability depends on water. The power company takes only 7% of the entire Whanganui River, but it\u2019s the clearest, cleanest, coldest water at the head. That water is pushed through tunnels, canals, lakes and power stations until it eventually flows into an entirely different river system. On average, only 20% of the Whanganui\u2019s headwaters flow past the intake structure to the sea.\nTo the tribes that hold this river sacred, this causes environmental, cultural and spiritual damage. They categorically oppose the extraction of their river\u2019s water, and though the new law gives the river newfound rights, it does not reverse pre-existing laws, including the consent granting Genesis the rights to divert water for hydroelectric power until 2039.\nSpeedy walks across a massive diversion culvert carrying water from the upper tributaries to the power station. He looks down at the narrow Whanganui River below.\n\u201cThe energy in this river \u2026 can be used for electricity, but it also energises the cultural and spiritual values of this landscape, [which is] very important to M\u0101ori,\u201d he says. \u201cIt energises biodiversity, in the form of animals and fish, like whio and eels, angling for trout fishermen, kayaking, rafting.\u201d\nBut it is a delicate balance for the country of nearly 5 million people.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of uses from this energy that\u2019s flowing past us here,\u201d Speedy says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to strike that balance between renewable energy to run our society and our economy, but not wreck the environments that we take the energy from.\u201d\nThirty kilometres downriver, Adam Daniel, who works for Fish & Game New Zealand, ploughs through a narrow tunnel of sopping wet ferns and gorse with his quad bike. He checks the GPS and navigates deeper into the steep undulating bush country of the 20,000-hectare Tongariro Forest Conservation Area.\nDaniel is on a multi-day adventure collecting water samples on the Whanganui\u2019s upper tributaries. He is using money raised from increased foreign angler licences and Genesis Energy funding intended to mitigate some of its environmental impacts to conduct a two-year water quality study on the upper river.\nPrevious studies alerted Daniel that the Whanganui River is far dirtier than its tributary the Whakapapa River, even though they both start in the national park. So every month \u2013 rain, shine or snow \u2013 he visits 16 backcountry study areas to gather water samples and log electro-conductivity and temperature readings.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recognised the turbidity in the river is really high \u2013 there\u2019s more dirt than there should be,\u201d says Daniel, whose job is to protect river habitat. \u201cSo I am trying to identify the catchments [watersheds] here in the upper end of the Whanganui that have high loads of sediment.\u201d\nMore than halfway through his study, Daniel became alarmed. He was in the back-country preparing to drift down the upper river in a wetsuit to count fish. He waded into the river and looked down.\nThe Whanganui River had less than a metre visibility (the neighbouring Whakapapa River still had seven metres of visibility).\nDaniel hiked every stream on the upper river \u2013 they were clear. However, when he checked the stream below the large discharge pipe from Lake Otamangakau, the picture became clearer.\nGenesis Energy diverts 80% of Whanganui\u2019s headwaters into the Lake Otamangaka. During low flows in summer, up to three cubic metres of cool water is discharged from the lake. Those flows are intended to help trout, whio and other species during stressful hot weather, but Daniel is concerned it may not be working as intended.\n\u201cThey can take nearly the entire river of crystal-clear cold water and run it through their man-made lake to keep fish alive, then dump the mixed water with algae and sediment back in the river,\u201d Daniel says.\nThis drastic change in visibility, coupled with higher water temperatures, has major impacts on the river\u2019s downstream habitat and the non-native trout and other native fish that rely on cold, clean water to thrive in the critical hot and dry summer months.\n\u201cWe are arguing that their consent condition does not exempt them from the temperature change and that the discharge is clearly having an impact on the river, so they should stop,\u201d Daniel says.\nNigel Clarke, the executive general manager of wholesale operations at Genesis, says the company is compliant with the regulations. \u201cGenesis is committed to the principle of kaitiakitanga; water is essential to our country, our business and to the communities we operate in.\n\u201cIn complex locations like the Tongariro Power Scheme where there are multiple users of water, we work closely in partnership with local iwi and local communities to positively influence and improve the ecological health and mauri of our waterways.\n\u201cGenesis operates the Tongariro Power Scheme in line with resource consents and always welcomes the opportunity to better understand any potential effects of its operations.\u201d\nSpeedymaintains the turbidity \u201cis not massive \u2026 there is some discolouration. It\u2019s not crystal clear but it\u2019s not real dirty brown either.\u201d\nBut he says Genesis is looking into the issue. \u201cWe are going to implement a regime this summer where we do more sampling, where we try and tease out the difference between the various components of the turbidity.\u201d\nSome 145km downstream, Josephine Haworth and her husband operate Whanganui River Adventures. They live in Pipiriki, a small village 85km from the sea. The town is nestled in the lush green hills on a curved bend in the river at the southern edge of Whanganui National Park \u2013 home to the famous Whanganui Journey, a five-day, 145km canoe trip through the park. Haworth is from the Whanganui tribes and is the third generation of her family to operate a tour business on the river. Her husband grew up here and his family has been in the business since the 1970s.\n\u201cThe river is nothing new,\u201d Haworth says about the river that runs through her backyard. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a part of us. It always will be, until the day we die.\u201d\nBut the river here is often the colour of chocolate milk from the myriad tributaries that swell with rain and carry soil and sediment from the forest and farm country. The streams bring water, but they also bring sediment and E coli. That\u2019s a concern for the about 18,000 people who canoe it each year. The Haworths lives are intertwined with the river, so it concerns her too.\nWhen it comes to the river\u2019s personhood, she says it\u2019s hard to explain because the river has always been a big part of her family\u2019s lives. \u201cThe river is our food source, the river is our playground, the river is our work. It\u2019s always been a big part of our lives growing up. The river has always been us.\u201d\nIn the town of Whanganui near the river\u2019s mouth, Howard Hyland hosed thick mud off the cement boat ramp connecting the Whanganui River Outrigger Canoe Club\u2019s boathouse to the river. The 76-year-old New Zealander is a national coach and paddler for waka ama, traditional outrigger canoes.\nHere, near the sea, the river is wide, slow and steady \u2013 home to kayaking, rowing and waka ama clubs. Hyland returned from Whakatane to his roots on the river to start a waka ama club for youth.\n\u201cI wanted to start a club that was for all peoples, not just for M\u0101ori, not just for p\u0101keh\u0101, not just for islanders. I wanted it for all of Whanganui,\u201d he says.\nHyland is connected to the river through his grandmother. When he was four years old, he learned to paddle the waka while she fished. Through her love of the river, he became involved in the river and the sport.\nA paddler calls out \u201chup\u201d, signalling the paddlers to switch sides in unison as the team paddle up the river past Hyland. Hyland sees the macro and micro problems the river faces. The biggest issue, he says, is the siphoning of the headwaters for power, but he also details the simple problem of polluting.\n\u201cYou watch these kids, you see they bring back all the plastics that they see on the river,\u201d Hyland says with a hint of pride. \u201cIt tells you they have learned something while they\u2019ve been here. They understand we\u2019ve got to stop polluting the river.\u201d\nFor Hyland, the river is a vehicle to train good paddlers and good people who care for the river. The river provides his rowers with a place to succeed, a place to grow and a place to find solace at 5:30am as the sun casts first light across the river\u2019s mist.\nWhile the paddlers disappear up river, Howard shares the whakatauki, or philosophy, shared by those connected to the river.\nThis river is now Te Awa Tupua. The new status offers New Zealand a framework to chart a new course to protect the Whanganui River and provide the world with a blueprint for caring for the earth\u2019s arteries.\nBarraclough says there are now guardians who can argue for the river in court, if its rights are infringed. The law doesn\u2019t offer iron-clad protections, but \u201cit does mean that it stands a better chance.\u201d\nO\u2019Donnell agrees. \u201cIt definitely has power to drive long-term change. How it holds people to account, I think that is going to be the tricky part.\u201d\nHosing off the last mud from the ramp, Hyland wonders what the future will bring for his beloved river. \u201cIf you give the river a voice, are you going to listen?\u201d",

        "content": "Crossing Lines at Melbourne\u2019s NGV celebrates Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, close friends and twin giants of the late 20th century art world\nWhen Gil Vasquez was a young DJ in New York, two things happened that changed his life: his closest friend, Keith Haring, died of Aids, and \u2013 with a small group of friends and peers \u2013 he inherited one of the most important artistic legacies of the 20th century.\n\u201cIt felt quite overwhelming,\u201d Vasquez says when we meet at the Keith Haring Foundation headquarters in Manhattan. He was only 19 at the time. \u201cNone of us had any idea how to run a foundation.\u201d\nSet in Haring\u2019s old studio, the organisation \u2013 of which Vasquez is now acting director \u2013 protects the artist\u2019s archives, work and copyright. Haring started out as a graffiti artist in the late 70s, bombing tens of thousands of unused subway ad spaces with chalk. Within a few years he had been embraced by the vibrant art and club scene of downtown Manhattan, and his work was taking him around the world.\nThese days, the foundation makes money through sales and licensing of Haring\u2019s iconography \u2013 the dancing dogs, radiant babies and more stridently political pieces \u2013 which it then spends to continue his activist missions: in the past 12 months, he says, they gave $5m worth of grants to non-profits including the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis and Planned Parenthood.\nIt\u2019s also thanks to the foundation \u2013 and its collection of Haring\u2019s photos, sketches and journal entries \u2013 that the National Gallery of Victoria is able to bring a more personal side to its major summer show.\nCrossing Lines, which opened on Friday, is an unprecedented exhibition that presents more than 200 pieces from Haring and his peer and friend, Jean-Michel Basquiat, across 13 rooms or sections \u2013 including video installations, art sculptures, and a corridor of celebrity faces snapped on Polaroid by Maripol. It\u2019s the first time both artists have been presented in dialogue at a public museum, and likely the last time in a long while that the region will see their work on this scale again.\nThe two artists were friends, collaborators and occasional rivals who are synonymous with the groundbreaking art scene of 1980s New York. While their work couldn\u2019t differ more aesthetically, the NGV exhibition bristles with the political urgency that drove them both: Basquiat was a black man, Haring a gay one, and their stars were rising in an industry that continues to either exclude difference, or fetishise and appropriate it.\nFamously, both pioneers were cut short in their prime. Basquiat never got to enjoy the institutional status, cult standing and record-breaking sales figures his work has since accrued: he was 27 when he overdosed on heroin in 1988, a year after the death of their close friend and mentor Andy Warhol.\nHaring, who had predicted he would die from Aids before he was even diagnosed, was gone two years later, at 31.\nWhat\u2019s it like to to watch someone you loved dearly become a cult hero after their death? Vasquez is thoughtful and soft-spoken as he shows me around Haring\u2019s old studio, where the artist\u2019s paint is still splattered across the floor. \u201cHe was really funny and sharp \u2013 he somehow just lit up this room when he walked in,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe parade of people that were in and out of here, coming to visit. He was just so generous with his time.\u201d\nHe opens cabinets filled with the meticulous records Haring kept: on one page is the phone number for \u201cSteven Jobs\u201d; in a nearby folder, his art school schedule (semiotics, 10.30 on Wednesdays and Fridays). Much of this is on display at the NGV \u2013 there are iPads that let you flick through his journal \u2013 along with pages from Basquiat\u2019s notebooks on loan from collector Larry Warsh. These personal logs have proven invaluable for historians and curators, and show a pair of young thinkers and experimenters, and who were already, audaciously, planning for their legacy.\nVasquez met Haring in the late 80s; he spent the last two years of the artist\u2019s life by his side. \u201cEven in 1982 [Haring] was thinking, \u2018I\u2019m important. It\u2019s my responsibility to leave things behind to study\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wanted his name to be spoken among the greatest artists \u2026 he knew that it was a very special time. He wanted to ensure that he would live beyond his own life.\u201d\nHaring\u2019s major public artworks have become synonymous with New York: the stark Crack is Wack wall in East Harlem; the joyful figures that play over the Carmine Street pool; and the far more risque scenes \u2013 giant penises, ejaculate, anal sex \u2013 that adorn the men\u2019s bathrooms at the LBGT Centre. His work was often radical and political, imbued with queer symbolism and popping colours; he designed fliers for anti-nuclear protests, and was outspoken about Aids, apartheid, racism and the mass media.\nIt was a heady, glamorous time in Manhattan, at the Mudd Club, Club 57, the Fun Gallery. They were mingling with Warhol, Yoko Ono, William S Burroughs, Fab Five Freddy and Grace Jones. Vasquez was an emerging DJ \u2013 G-Bo The Pro \u2013 and was star struck more than once. \u201cBe careful with her,\u201d Haring joked when he introduced his friend to Basquiat\u2019s girlfriend, Madonna. \u201cShe\u2019s going to to try and steal you away.\u201d\nDespite rumours of romance, Vasquez says his relationship with Haring was platonic \u2013 but the love ran deep: you can find the letters \u201cG-Bo\u201d hidden snugly in some of Haring\u2019s tessellated works. \u201cIt was a little wink to say, \u2018I was thinking about you that day\u2019.\u201d Their friendship was a mentorship, too: \u201cIt was like learning something that I had absolutely no idea existed,\u201d Vasquez says. \u201cEvery day was like that, for almost two years.\u201d\nBut over all of this, the Aids crisis loomed: a relentless onslaught of loss, grief and funerals. \u201cThis thing was just ravaging like a fire through the community. Everyone was taking significant losses: friends, collaborators \u2013 if you were of a certain age, you were touched by Aids or HIV, you\u2019d lost somebody that you care about.\n\u201cThe world lost really significant, important people,\u201d Vasquez continues. \u201cIt was crazy that that was the norm.\u201d\nIn a journal entry from March 1987, Haring wrote: \u201cI am quite aware that I have or will have Aids. My days are numbered. Important to do as much as possible as quickly as possible \u2026 art is more important than life.\u201d\nIn the exhibition catalogue, guest curator Dieter Bucchart, an art historian, describes both Haring and Basquiat as \u201cmanic draughtsmen\u201d; they painted and drew on any surface \u2013 walls, refrigerators, radiators \u2013 everywhere, all the time. But their process couldn\u2019t have differed more.\nComing up in the rush of illicit graffiti, Haring was quick but meticulous, mapping out complex, jigsaw-like pieces in his mind before painting them with confident lines. He wouldn\u2019t take a step back to survey his work until it was done.\nFor Basquiat, meanwhile, it seemed a piece was never finished: he would scribble over or add words and symbols to his chaotic expressions \u2013 or just paint a block of colour on top.\nTo watch him was infuriating. \u201cIt would drive [Haring] absolutely crazy,\u201d Vasquez laughs. \u201cKeith would walk by something that was on the wall, and would think it\u2019s just beautiful. And then at some point during the day, Jean-Michel would start covering it up with more paint. Keith would be like, \u2018What are you doing! It\u2019s finished! It\u2019s flawless as it is!\u2019 \u201d\nBoth favoured motifs as a type of vocabulary: for Haring, it was babies, batons dogs, phallic symbols and screens; for Basquiat, it was crowns, copyright signs, skulls and slogans. As Rene Ricard wrote in The Radiant Child, his 1981 essay about both artists, the symbols and their ubiquity had the \u201csame effect as advertising \u2026 the greatest thing is to come up with something so good it seems as if it\u2019s always been there, like a proverb\u201d.\nBoth were heartbroken by the death of Warhol \u2013 and when Basquiat died, Haring was bereft: he had seen his friend only a few weeks earlier, and thought he was finally clean.\nHe painted a Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat (1988) in tribute. It hangs in the middle of the final room at the NGV show; on the other side of the wall is Haring\u2019s handwritten draft of an obituary. \u201cThe ease with which he achieved profundity convinced me of his genius,\u201d he wrote, in Vogue. \u201cBut perhaps it was his simple honesty that has made him a true hero.\u201d\nIt\u2019s startling to see so much of their work side by side, coming from the same era, responding to the same injustices \u2013 racism, police violence, social inequality \u2013 but driven by a different experience of the world.\nHaring\u2019s rise came off the back of subway graffiti, which had originated among black people who were being killed, not celebrated, for it. Basquiat, meanwhile, was often dismissed as a jumped-up graffiti artist, for work that had more in common with Germany\u2019s Neue Wilde movement than it did with street art. (\u201cThey\u2019re just racist, most of these people,\u201d he said.) In fact, while Haring\u2019s work overtly targeted racism, some academics \u2013 including Ricardo Montez in the exhibition catalogue \u2013 argue that he was occasionally guilty of the same racial fetishisation that Basquiat was trying to shake off.\n\u201cJean-Michel was frustrated with people who could not see beyond [his race], or who tried to categorise or box him in based on their assumptions about him as a black man,\u201d his sisters Lisane and Jeannine Basquiat tell the Guardian, over email. The NGV show features many of his portraits celebrating black men as defiant heroes \u2013 alongside pieces like Irony of a Negro Policemen, which take direct aim at racial injustice and police brutality.\nBasquiat was prolific, creating more than 2,000 pieces before his death, but only around 10 are in public collections \u2013 making a show like this particularly complicated to put together. With just six years between his first solo show and his death, most major galleries didn\u2019t move fast enough to snap it up. \u201cInstitutions were slow to recognise his talent,\u201d Lisane says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t always embrace something new and different.\u201d\nMore than 100 are at the NGV, almost exclusively on loan from private collectors who are sitting on the kind of fortune Basquiat never enjoyed: his Untitled 1982 (LA Painting), for instance, broke records in 2017 when it sold at auction for $110.5m \u2013 the highest amount ever for an American artist.\nHis sisters run the Basquiat estate, and say the celebration of him now is \u201cbittersweet\u201d, tied up as it is with a mythology that often diverges from the truth. One rumour, for instance, gathered steam early on: of a wild black runaway churning out masterpieces for gallerist Annina Nosei, while being kept in her basement. \u201cOh Christ,\u201d Basquiat said at the time. \u201cIf I was white they would just call it an artist-in-residence.\u201d\n\u201cJean-Michel was not homeless, nor was he estranged from his family,\u201d his sister Lisane says.

        "content": "In six weeks, a measles outbreak has infected 3,000 people out of a population of 200,000, killing 42, mostly children\nFa\u2019aoso Tuivale sleeps on her children\u2019s grave during the day, when she misses them most.\nShe and her husband, Tuivale Luamanuvae Puelua, are sitting on the newly-dried concrete that mark the graves of their three-year-old Itila and 13-month-old twins, Tamara and Sale, talking about the week that has passed since they buried them.\n\u201cMy children\u2019s deaths came like a thief in the night, so sudden and unexpected,\u201d Puelua said.\n\u201cYour mind becomes empty and you are speechless because there are no words on this earth to describe how my wife and I feel having to say goodbye to our children.\u201d\nThe Tuivales are the worst affected family by a disease that has been ravaging the tiny south Pacific of Samoa for over a month.\nSamoa, which is 4,300km east of Sydney and graduated to developing country status in 2014, is known to most people outside it as a peaceful, tropical holiday destination. But over the last six weeks, the country has been gripped by a devastating measles outbreak. There have been more than 3,000 confirmed cases in a country of just 200,000 people and 42 people have died, 38 of them children under four.\nThe Tuivale family live in the village of Lauli\u2019i, 9km from the capital of Apia. Their home, tucked among their plantation of pineapple, banana, taro and papaya trees is at the very back of a long dirt road that follows the Namo river.\n\u201cSale was the quiet one, he was usually well-behaved,\u201d Tuivale recalls of the children he has lost. \u201cTamara and Itila are known to be the ones that argue and fight all the time.\n\u201cMy father\u2019s garden is usually used as a playground for the three-year-old; he would mess up the plants and give his grandfather headaches.\u201d\nA perfect storm of events has meant that the global measles outbreak that has ripped through so many countries over the last year has had such a devastating impact as it reached Samoa\u2019s shores.\nThe world\u2019s most infectious disease has spread throughout much of the developed world this year, and while some countries have suffered devastating losses as a result, developed countries have seen comparatively little loss of human life. New Zealand recently suffered its worst epidemic in 20 years \u2013 2,000 people were infected, none died.\nSamoa has a huge diaspora community in New Zealand making it inevitable that measles would eventually reach Samoan shores. When it arrived, it reached a population with devastatingly low vaccination rates and a health service ill-equipped to meet the challenge of such an epidemic.\nSamoa\u2019s total population immunity has been estimated by the WHO to be as low as 30-40%, compared with its Pacific neighbours, such as Tonga and American Samoa, which boast immunisation rates of over 90%, close to or matching recommended rates for achieving immunity.\nThe immunisation rates of babies have plummeted in recent years. Four years ago, roughly 85% of one-year-olds were vaccinated, in 2017 that dropped to 60%.\nBut since then the rate plummeted sharply, after a scandal that rocked Samoa in 2018, when two Samoan nurses administered MMR vaccines to babies who subsequently died. The nurses pleaded guilty to negligence causing manslaughter and were sentenced to five years in prison after it emerged that one of the nurses mixed the MMR vaccine powder with expired muscle relaxant anaesthetic instead of water for injection.\nPeople lost trust in the government and in immunisation programs, meaning that by 2018, only 31% of children under five had been vaccinated.\nPeter von Heiderbrandt was the first child killed in the outbreak; he died on White Sunday, the national children\u2019s holiday on 13 October.\n\u201cNo one ever thinks about burying their children, you always think my children will bury me,\u201d his father, Jordan von Heiderbrandt said.\nComplications such as pneumonia have taken even more lives, an Australian doctor Dan Holmes told the Samoa Observer, especially when treatment is too much for the small bodies to handle.\n\u201cThere is undoubtedly a chance that there is a burden on those children who have had those very severe infections, that they will go on to have some more problems in the future.\u201d\nNot only had health authorities been lax in immunisation coverage, once measles arrived they were slow to declare that the country faced an epidemic, waiting until several weeks after the outbreak, after 200 suspected cases were confirmed and one child had died. A month later, on 15 November, when the death toll had climbed to 16, the government declared a national state of emergency.\nSince the declaration, the country has changed dramatically.\nVaccinations became mandatory and a mass campaign began the following Monday, leading to more than 30 stations set up inside church halls and primary schools, and even one outside a supermarket.\nDozens of mobile clinics \u2013 vans packed with nurses armed with megaphones \u2013 are driven around the country trying to reach every person and police are deployed to keep the peace at vaccination clinics.\nUnder the state of emergency rules, people under the age of 19 are banned from public gatherings. Schools have been closed, with exams incomplete and prize-giving and graduation ceremonies cancelled.\nApia\u2019s coffee shops are sitting empty and market vendors\u2019 stocks are unsold. Scared for their young ones, families have cancelled flights home to Samoa for the Christmas season, usually the busiest time of the year for tourism, while pharmacies have reported selling out of hand sanitiser and surgical masks, which have become commonplace accessories in the markets, banks and workplaces across town.\nAfter the Samoan government reached for help, in just two weeks nearly 100 extra medical personnel have arrived from Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia and the United States. A team of doctors, nurses and epidemiologists from the UK flew out to the country on Friday and hundreds of thousands of vaccines have been shipped from New Zealand and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\nThe government\u2019s best efforts to fight the epidemic are being challenged by online influencers peddling alternative \u201ccures\u201d. Vitamins and kangen water \u2013 alkalised water made using a Japanese machine \u2013 are both touted as cures.\nAnti-vaxxers have spread their message online, including one \u2013 who is also a social media influencer and the wife of a Samoan rugby league player \u2013 who likened Samoa to Nazi Germany for its mandatory vaccination program.\nSome families are opting for Samoan traditional healers who use remedies like tea leaves, which are effective in reducing fever, but can do little for the actual virus.\nThe WHO has debunked all such \u201ccures\u201d and warned that there is no evidence to suggest any of those treatments work.\n\u201cTo delay or to obscure with treatment that does not work, I think, is conning people unfairly into not getting treatment,\u201d said Nikki Turner, WHO Chair of the International Committee on measles and rubella.\nSamoa\u2019s director general of health, Take Naseri is urging families and the traditional healers to come to the hospital first, before the complications are irreversible.\n\u201cWhen people are desperate, they look for other ways to get assistance and we cannot stop that right of people to choose where they want to go. We give them all the information so they have an informed decision, and that is the very difficult part.\u201d\nWith infections rising to as much as 200 people a day, the epidemic is yet to reach the critical inflection point at which the disease stops spreading.\n\u201cThis is unprecedented\u2026 Everybody is thinking on their feet,\u201d said Limbo Fiu, president of the Samoa General Practitioners Association.\n\u201cWe anticipate this to go on for quite some time.\u201d\nThis article was a co-production with the Samoa Observer.",

        "content": "In the end, when the Arsenal statement dropped on Friday morning to confirm the departure of Unai Emery, it came as a mercy. For the past few weeks the mood among many of the players had been they wanted the manager out and they did not exactly hide it at the training ground, and for the past six or so \u2013 from the Premier League defeat at Sheffield United \u2013 Emery had looked every inch the condemned man, thrashing desperately but unable to find succour.\nThere was a time when he had a clear plan about how to shape a team in the aftermath of the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger era, which ended in May 2018; how to return Arsenal to the Champions League and, for much of his first season in charge, he felt that he was close to finding the answers.\nOn 1 April, after the home win over Newcastle, the club sat third in the table \u2013 with only seven matches to go. That they would implode, losing four of those games to finish fifth, was the first indelible stain against his reputation and it was followed by the calamitous Europa League final defeat by Chelsea, when the team surrendered their second shot at Champions League qualification.\nEmery never recovered from that 4-1 beating in Baku, when the second half resembled an ordeal, and after no little stuttering over the first two months of this season the unravelling has been comprehensive. The statistics during the death roll showed one win from nine matches and it was a period when Emery lost all composure, when he failed to manage the numerous issues he faced. They would coalesce to drag him down.\nThe starting point for any assessment of Emery\u2019s Arsenal tenure must be Mesut \u00d6zil, the mercurial playmaker who was given a \u00a3350,000-a-week contract in February 2018 to prevent him from leaving as a free agent. It is difficult to overstate how divisive that club decision came to be, with sections of the dressing room questioning whether \u00d6zil has retained the same motivation. Toxic opinions have bubbled and some of the players wanted him to be sold during this most recent summer. There was no market for him.\nEmery inherited the situation but, from an early juncture, it was apparent that \u00d6zil would not be a natural fit for his way of playing, which does allow for creativity albeit within a structured framework. On a related point Aaron Ramsey \u2013 who was allowed to join Juventus on a Bosman in July \u2013 also seemed to jar in Emery\u2019s system, leading to the legitimate criticism that the manager fell short when it came to dealing with off-the-cuff and expressive players. He had struggled to manage Neymar at his previous club, Paris Saint-Germain, and more pressingly he failed to draw the required levels from Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, for whom Arsenal paid a club record \u00a372m in August.\nEmery tried everything with \u00d6zil, from the carrot to the stick, but the moment that symbolised their dysfunctional relationship came when he substituted him in the Europa League final, sending on the youngster Joe Willock in his place.\n\u00d6zil forms part of a dressing-room clique with Sead Kolasinac and Shkodran Mustafi, and there has been finger-pointing in their direction, while Lucas Torreira has suffered a dramatic drop-off in form. Emery lamented the sale of Laurent Koscielny on the eve of the season \u2013 the club captain forced his move to Bordeaux \u2013 and his replacement, David Luiz, came with defensive risks attached.\nThen there has been the Granit Xhaka saga. Emery delayed appointing him as Koscielny\u2019s replacement as captain for weeks and took too long in reaching the decision to strip him of the role after his well-documented bust-up with home supporters at the Crystal Palace game on 27 October. Xhaka returned to the lineup against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday night, which would be Emery\u2019s final match. The manager looked indecisive during the affair and did not offer Xhaka any support \u2013 a dangerous game to play with a popular dressing-room figure.\nEmery tied himself in knots over the closing weeks of his tenure, flitting erratically from one strategy to another. He seemed to overthink things and ended up confusing the players \u2013 plus possibly himself. Emery had always stressed how his team would react in defensive terms to what an opponent would bring but impose themselves when they had possession. Towards the end the players felt he had become too consumed by what the opposition might do with and without the ball. There was no proactivity and it led to shutdown.\nEmery\u2019s vision was to play a fast, short-passing game, with several options for each man in possession; taking the best was meant to become second nature. The full-backs would bomb on and the forwards would get on to their crosses. The plan relied on a central midfielder to link everything up, a Santi Cazorla-type, but, taking in the problems with \u00d6zil, Torreira and Xhaka, Emery did not really find one. Matteo Guendouzi does not always seize the initiative and Dani Ceballos has fired in fits and starts.\nUnai Emery has thanked Arsenal and the club's fans in an open letter published on the club's official website. \"I would have liked nothing more than to have achieved better results for you\" he wrote. \"It has been a year and a half full of emotions, of great moments and some other more bitter ones, but not a single day has gone by without me stopping to think about how lucky I have been to work for this club with these players and their professional and personal qualities. They have always honoured the shirt they wear. They deserve your support. I had already experienced a lot in football, but I have enjoyed and learned a lot in England, in the Premier League, about respect for professionals and about the purity of football.\"\nEmery\u2019s dull press conferences will not be missed and it is important to say this was not an English language issue and more to do with his willingness to answer questions. He had an interpreter alongside him last season and could have spoken in Spanish to get any needed points across. No one would have been offended.\nThe lack of content from Emery raised questions about how he communicated with his players, how he inspired them, but it should be noted there were no such concerns when he oversaw a 22-game unbeaten run in the early months of his reign.\nEmery\u2019s players, as always in this situation, must look at themselves. How, for example, could they sleepwalk to defeat in that second half against Chelsea? The motivation for a European final has to come from within. It is Emery, though, who has paid the price. Few Arsenal fans have been sorry to see him go.",

        "content": "Judiciary committee chairman said on Friday he looks forward to \u2018prompt response\u2019 while president is at his Florida golf club\nHouse judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler wrote to Donald Trump on Friday, asking if the president \u201cintends to participate\u201d in impeachment inquiry hearings due to begin next week.\n\u201cI look forward to your prompt response,\u201d he wrote.\nThe president spent Friday at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, having returned from a surprise Thanksgiving visit to troops in Afghanistan.\nHe did not immediately comment or tweet. Trump has said he would like to testify in the impeachment inquiry, as senior aides from the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to former national security adviser John Bolton have not.\nSuch refusals have stoked a standoff between the Democrats who control the House of Representatives and the White House over the proper exercise of constitutional powers and authorities.\nA judge this week ruled that \u201cpresidents are not kings\u201d, meaning Don McGahn, the former White House counsel, must testify in the impeachment hearings despite claims that he had \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d as a top presidential adviser.\nNadler greeted that ruling as showing the White House stance had \u201cno basis in law\u201d. Nonetheless, the justice department immediately moved to appeal.\nNadler wrote to Trump earlier this week, offering him the chance to participate.\n\u201cAt base,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe president has a choice to make: he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process.\u201d\nThe impeachment inquiry concerns efforts by Trump to have Ukraine investigate Joe Biden, a political rival and former vice-president, and a baseless conspiracy theory about supposed Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election, rather than Russian.\nTrump and Republicans deny the president abused his power but Mulvaney has admitted nearly $400m of military aid was held up in an effort to force Ukraine to comply and a succession of witnesses at hearings held by the House intelligence committee painted a damning picture of attempts to make Trump\u2019s wishes reality.\nPublic opinion remains split on the issue, with about 50% of respondents in recent polls saying they favour Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal. Trump has claimed, falsely, that support for the process is plummeting.\n\u201cI hope that he chooses to participate in the inquiry,\u201d Nadler wrote earlier this week, \u201cdirectly or through counsel, as other presidents have done before him.\u201d\nIn his letter on Friday, Nadler quoted Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee who has said his panel\u2019s report will be submitted to Congress \u201csoon after the Thanksgiving recess\u201d.\n\u201cThat report,\u201d Nadler wrote, \u201cwill describe, among other things, \u2018a months-long effort in which President Trump again sought foreign interference in our elections for his personal and political benefit at the expense of our national interest\u2019 and \u2018an unprecedented campaign of obstruction in an effort to prevent the committee from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony\u2019.\u201d\nNadler also underlined his own committee\u2019s investigation of alleged obstruction by Trump detailed in the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.\nThe judiciary committee will decide if a formal impeachment vote will be held and, if so, what articles of impeachment will be presented.\nIf such a vote passes, as would be expected as the Democrats hold the House, Trump would be sent to the Senate for trial, probably in January. As Republicans hold that chamber and no significant cracks have appeared in GOP support, Trump would expect to avoid conviction and removal.\nNadler asked Trump for notice of \u201cwhether your counsel intends to participate \u2026 no later than 5pm on [Friday] 6 December 2019\u201d. The first judiciary committee hearing is scheduled for Wednesday 4 December.",

        "content": "Judge finds teenager\u2019s actions were motivated by sexual orientation of two women\nA 17-year-old boy has been sentenced to a four-month youth rehabilitation order for his part in the harassment and intimidation of two women on a late-night London bus in an incident which became the focus of concerns about the targeting of LGBTQ+ people.\nOne of the women told the court of her fears when she and her date were \u201cphysically cornered\u201d by a group of teenagers and subjected to demands to show them how lesbians have sex.\n\u201cIt was scary and, frankly, I deal with a lot of harassment in London,\u201d Christine Hannigan told Highbury youth court on Friday. The court viewed CCTV footage of an incident that became the focus of global attention when an image showing the two women looking shocked and covered in blood in its aftermath went viral.\nShe said she had initially ignored the teenagers \u2013 and had pretended to be sick while the other woman, Melania Ramirez, attempted to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the situation \u2013 but engaged with the group after coins began to be thrown and the incident escalated into a scuffle.\n\u201cMelania and I were clearly together in a romantic sense,\u201d said Hannigan, who added that the teenagers had made a \u201cscissoring\u201d gesture which was taken to be homophobic.\n\u201cThey were being very aggressive verbally and then they made it physical.\u201d\nGiving evidence from behind a screen, Hannigan said verbal abuse was common and she had experience of that escalating into something physical.\nOn Thursday, three teenagers, aged 15, 16 and 17, admitted harassing and threatening Hannigan and Ramirez in the early hours of the morning on 30 May on the top deck of a bus in Camden. The judge, Susan Williams, said the couple had caught the teenagers\u2019 attention because they were a same-sex couple.\nHowever, evidence had to be given in court on Friday after one of the accused, 17, denied his actions had been motivated by hostility based on the women\u2019s sexual orientation. The other three were bailed for sentencing at later dates.\nWilliams found that the 17-year-old\u2019s role in the incident was motivated by hostility towards their sexuality.\nPassing judgment she said: \u201cI am quite sure this was a hostile act. However, I also have to be sure that you were hostile because Ms Hannigan was a lesbian.\n\u201cIn other words that you were picking on her because of who she was and not just fooling around. I have come to the short conclusion that is exactly what you were doing.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThose two ladies were being harassed, pestered and intimidated because of who they were.\n\u201cI am quite sure you were joining in that behaviour.\u201d\nThe 17-year-old was sentenced to a four-month youth rehabilitation order and is barred from contacting his co-defendants over the same period.\nHe will also face a 20-hour reparation requirement, similar to community service, and a two-week curfew. Williams also suggested he write a letter of apology to the two women.\nAfter Hannigan and Ramirez went upstairs and took seats at the front of the bus, CCTV showed the teenagers quickly moving from the back and taking up positions near the women in what the judge said was \u201clike the tide washing in\u201d.\nOver nine minutes, the incident escalated into a scuffle before the teenagers got off and the women were left bloodied and without belongings, including a mobile phone. Both were taken to hospital for treatment to facial injuries.\nThe prosecution said the women\u2019s sexual orientation was an aggravating factor.\nDavid Wood, a solicitor representing the 17-year-old, took Hannigan through a police statement made shortly after the incident in which she told of standing up and telling the teenagers: \u201cKeep throwing coins and see what happens.\u201d\nShe said in the statement she had walked down the bus and had been immediately punched by one of the teenagers. Hannigan, who was shown throwing a punch on CCTV footage of the incident, told the court on Friday her recollection of who threw the first punch was not accurate.\nBut while her memories of the night may have been different from what she said at the time, Hannigan told the court that the coin throwing was the start of physical hostilities. \u201cIt turned into a fight because they were becoming physically aggressive with us,\u201d she said.\nGiving his evidence on Friday, the teenager said he had approached the women later than the rest of the group did because the conversation seemed \u201cfriendly\u201d.\nHe was asked by his solicitor: \u201cDid you throw the coin because you thought those two women were gay?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d he replied.\nWood said the teenager was immature and not motivated by hostility when he threw the coins at Hannigan. \u201cHe was 17 and just being stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have got over excited in a puerile, immature way over the fact that these women were in some sort of relationship.\u201d\nRamirez told the court: \u201cI am from Latin America where you have to live with this sort of behaviour from people. In this instance I felt intimidated because there were several of them.\u201d\nIn such circumstances, she said, \u201cI have this habit of making light of the situation in order to establish empathy from the people so they will stop bothering me.\u201d\nOn the bus, she learned that one of the teenagers had parents who were from Ecuador and engaged with him by speaking Spanish but she and Hannigan continued to be harassed. She remembered Hannigan passing in front of her and that there was a struggle going on.",

        "content": "Every league game Saracens play is now a cup final following their 35-point deduction for breaching the salary cap but so far their nerve is holding. After a shaky start the under-fire champions proved too strong and defensively sound for a frustrated Bath with 20 points from Owen Farrell on his return from World Cup action making all the difference.\nUntil the sin-binning of Maro Itoje nine minutes from the end Saracens were 25-12 ahead and reasonably comfortable on a cold, tricky night not made for free-flowing rugby. That suited Saracens\u2019 purposes fine, however, and their big forwards had too much for a home side who had not lost at the Rec to these opponents since April 2016\nWhile they remain on minus 18 points, still 22 points adrift, this was a crucial test of character passed from Saracens\u2019 perspective. With all their big \u2013 and highest-paid \u2013 men back they remain a formidable test for anyone and even Bath\u2019s World Cup winner Francois Louw, facing again the English contingent beaten by the Springboks in the final in Japan, could make little headway.\nWith Farrell kicking everything and a 33rd-minute try from Sean Maitland having given the visitors daylight, Sarries\u2019 director of rugby, Mark McCall, had every reason to be delighted. \u201cOur international players were magnificent... you saw what the club means to them,\u201d said McCall. \u201cI thought it was a real \u2018together\u2019 performance and really pleasing overall. That\u2019s a good win.\u201d\nThe Saracens\u2019 owner Nigel Wray, however, was not in attendance and, according to McCall, is currently reluctant to visit away grounds. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable to come to away matches at the moment.For someone who I believe has given rugby a lot it\u2019s really sad for him not to feel he can come and watch his club play rugby. Hopefully he\u2019ll start to feel differently soon.\u201d\nThere remain a number of important details to be clarified about the affair, however, and the game took place amid a slightly muted atmosphere, almost as if the crowd were not entirely sure how to respond to Sarries\u2019 presence. Until the full independent report into the salary cap affair is made public it will be impossible for neutrals to know for sure if any significant mitigating circumstances are involved. And until that day dawns the league will be tarnished by association, not a great look at precisely the moment it is trying to sell itself to a wider audience.\nNot that this was a game many of the Bath team will want to watch endlessly on catch-up. In many ways this was a chance missed, their performance not accurate or penetrative enough when it really mattered. In the first quarter, in particular, there were opportunities to be had, with Saracens struggling to adjust to a heavy pitch and a ball which seemed to be covered in some kind of non-stick coating.\nThree Rhys Priestland penalties had given Bath a narrow but deserved lead when Saracens belatedly began to rediscover some form. A sudden outbreak of deft midfield handling stretched the hitherto tight Bath defence and, from Elliot Daly\u2019s long ball, the alert Maitland cut inside to score the only try of the half.\nA further Farrell penalty extended the half-time lead to 16-9, throwing down the gauntlet to a Bath side who had lost only one of their previous 10 Premiership home games. There was a brief flicker when Tom Homer, shaggy haired these days, slalomed through a midfield hole but Saracens\u2019 ability to slow down their opponents\u2019 ball at the breakdown otherwise restricted the home team to marginal gains. Priestland\u2019s fourth penalty after 56 minutes briefly narrowed the gap but an offside decision swiftly gave Farrell the chance to restore order until Itoje\u2019s trip to the sin-bin briefly re-ignited the crowd\u2019s interest.\nThe pressure, though, will remain on Saracens for the foreseeable future. After their forthcoming European double whammy against Munster their next league games either side of Christmas are against the league leaders, Bristol, and then away at Exeter, who will be achingly keen to beat the champions at Sandy Park. Slogging away in the basement can be just as tough as staying at the top.",

And when we arrive at the hospital, we\u2019ll find it has been flogged off to Trump\u2019s America.\u201d\nRebecca Long-BaileyThis was an important outing for Long-Bailey, who is widely seen as a potential Labour leadership candidate.\nShe put in a combative performance \u2013 in particular challenging Rishi Sunak, representing the Tories, when he said the last Labour government had crashed the economy. \u201cWe suffered a world banking crisis: your chancellor was working at Deutsche Bank, selling the very derivatives that caused the crash in the first place,\u201d she said.\nAnd she challenged his claims about the impact of Labour\u2019s plans, calling them \u201cfabrications\u201d and retorting: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any costings from your party whatsoever.\u201d\nNicola SturgeonSturgeon is always a poised performer, and this was no exception.

Silva later maintained he had not been given an ultimatum by the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri but, with a visit to second-placed Leicester on Sunday followed by a midweek trip to Liverpool, his position is precarious in the extreme.\nEverton fans joined in with Norwich chants of, \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning\u201d following last Saturday\u2019s dismal home defeat and Silva said of the crowd\u2019s reaction: \u201cI will not lie to you, it was tough.\u201d But he was unable to say whether he expected to be in charge for Everton\u2019s next home game against Chelsea.\n\u201cI don\u2019t lose time thinking about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can tell you about the situation: I will do my job every single day. One member of our board and our sporting director answered more or less this question. If you ask many managers where they will be in two weeks then sometimes in football it is not easy to speak out. I cannot answer directly about a situation that is not in my hands. It is not the type of question you can ask me. I am not the right person to answer to you.\u201d\nBrands cited injuries and VAR errors as evidence of Silva\u2019s misfortune and the manager is likely to be without four central midfielders at Leicester through injury.\nBrands admitted results had to improve. \u201cIf you look at the ranking now and the results, I think we all expect better,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have been a little bit unlucky with the VAR decisions and some injuries but still we have a very good squad and we have to improve our results. That is also what Marco is working very hard on to get that done together with the players and I think as a board we have to support that.\n\u201cWe know in sport, as always, you have to perform \u2013 that\u2019s for me, the manager, the players, for everyone. It\u2019s also important, especially in this club, after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation. I think the most important thing is that the squad feels they can improve and that the staff feel they can improve the situation. We all have to support them. As a director of football, as a board member, we as a board are united in that.\u201d\nBrands claimed the Brazil forward Richarlison, who was brought to the club by Silva, was close to signing a five-year contract extension. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult period but I still think we have to look positive ahead and I try to do that also. One of the positive things during this week was that we are now busy with the last details of extending the contract of one of our key players, Richarlison, until 2024. That\u2019s something positive, especially for the long term.\u201d",

When everyone else is enjoying themselves we\u2019ll be here but, hopefully, there\u2019ll be time in January when we can all have a do together.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s intention to be present marks a departure from the past when managers routinely stayed away from Christmas festivities, turning blind eyes as players let their hair down and, sometimes, behaved badly. \u201cThose days are gone,\u201d said Bruce, who is likely to keep faith with his goal-shy front three of Joelinton, Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Allan Saint-Maximin against City. \u201cWith the games coming up I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any Christmas parties in the Premier League. We\u2019ve got seven games in 30 days or so. December\u2019s nonstop.\u201d\nWith their attacking trident having scored one goal \u2013 Joelinton\u2019s winner at Tottenham in August \u2013 during a collective 57 hours since joining the club, Newcastle\u2019s hopes of reprising last January\u2019s 2-1 win against Pep Guardiola\u2019s side at St James\u2019 Park appear slim. Their cause is further hampered by Matt Ritchie, usually one of the team\u2019s principal goal creators, having had a second ankle operation of the season.\nThe influential winger or wing-back is not expected to play again until late January after further surgery to repair the damage inflicted during a challenge by Leicester\u2019s Hamza Choudhury in August. At the time, Bruce labelled the tackle \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cpotentially career-ending\u201d and although Ritchie\u2019s medium-term prognosis is bright his absence has arguably cost his team dear at times.\n\u201cI said it was a bad challenge,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse when the player is out now until the end of January. Let\u2019s hope this time that Matty makes a full recovery. He\u2019s never really had an injury so he\u2019s not sure how to deal with it, but the strength of character he has, he\u2019ll be fine.\n\u201cA tiny fragment, a piece of bone, had obviously come away with the impact, and they\u2019ve gone into the tendon to remove it. I\u2019m not clued up on the technicalities but the surgeon hopes that, this time, it will do the trick.\u201d\nBruce is expected to recall Sean Longstaff after the central midfielder\u2019s completion of a three-match suspension.",

The bodies of two victims are still inside the half-crumbled remains of the 18-storey structure in downtown New Orleans. Developers are working with city officials to finalise plans to demolish the rest of the building.\nImmediately after the accident, Ramirez Palma was interviewed by the local Spanish-language media outlet Jambalaya News. Two days later he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), while fishing with his family in a national wildlife refuge, because he lacked identification documents.\nThe timing and circumstances of his October arrest raised suspicions among his lawyers and advocates that his detainment was connected to the hotel collapse and his previous safety complaints. The arrest and planned deportation drew widespread criticism from immigration advocates and some state officials in Louisiana.\nKing Company, Ramirez Palma\u2019s supervising company at the Hard Rock site, did not respond to interview requests from the Guardian.\nMary Yanick, a senior lawyer at the New Orleans Worker Center for Racial Justice, an advocacy group, said Ramirez Palma had been interviewed by the whistleblower division of the US government\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) on Monday. Osha and the New Orleans police department are investigating the hotel collapse.\nOsha did not respond to a request for comment on Ramirez Palma\u2019s role in the investigation.\nThis week Ava Dejoie, secretary of the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC), also advocated for Ramirez Palma\u2019s release, citing his role in the Hard Rock investigation and, more generally, the need to protect whistleblowers from retribution. The LWC is responsible for enforcing labor laws in the state.\nIn a 27 November letter addressed to William P Joyce, the New Orleans field office director of Ice, Dejoie implored the agency to release Ramirez Palma, stay his deportation and \u201ccommit to neutrality in ongoing labor investigations for all witnesses and victims\u201d. The letter was seen by the Guardian.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of a disaster of this scale, the public needs all available information to understand what happened at the worksite, including information from Mr Ramirez Palma and workers like him who witnessed safety violations before the collapse,\u201d Dejoie wrote. \u201cIf he is deported, the public may never know what key information is being deported with him. The investigations will undoubtedly suffer.\u201d\nAs of Friday afternoon she had not received a response to the letter. Ice representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Ramirez Palma\u2019s case.\nRamirez Palma\u2019s lawyers previously believed he would be deported earlier in the week but that was delayed until today for unknown reasons. In 2016 a judge ordered he be deported. He had been regularly checking in with Ice since then and filed for a stay of deportation during 2019, Yanick said.\nA citizen of Honduras, Ramirez Palma had lived with his wife and three children in New Orleans for 18 years. His lawyers and wife said he was seriously injured in the Hard Rock collapse and was briefly hospitalised for head trauma, internal inflammation and an acute eye injury that still requires surgery.",

Scotland Yard is investigating the 28-year-old, who was known to the authorities and fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements. He was allowed out a year ago after serving time for his part in a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange.\nKhan was arrested in December 2010 and released on licence (parole) in December 2018, wearing an electronic tag.\nA police search believed to be linked to the London Bridge investigation is being carried out in the West Midlands at a three-storey block of flats in Wolverhampton Road, Stafford, close to the town centre.\nTwo people, one man and one woman, died after being stabbed in the attack that started at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall during a conference about rehabilitating offenders. Another two women and a man were injured and taken to hospital.\nThe suspect was shot dead by police on London Bridge, about 2pm.\nKhan was attending the conference, according to the Met police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu. He said: \u201cWe believe that the attack began inside before he left the building and proceeded onto London Bridge.\u201d\nThe Parole Board has issued a statement saying it had no involvement in the release of Khan.\nFootage has emerged showing three members of the public, including one armed with a fire extinguisher and another with a five-foot narwhal tusk, grappling and grounding the attacker before police arrived.\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has argued that more resourcing is needed for the police, saying \u201cyou can\u2019t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have.\u201d\nSadiq Khan said there would be an increased police presence on the streets in the wake of the attack to reassure members of the public.\nSecurity minister Brandon Lewis refused to say whether the attack showed a failure by authorities. He repeatedly refused to comment on the specifics of the incident, but said that more assessment was needed of the sentences given to violent criminals.\nKhan was among nine men who pleaded guilty on the eve of their trial to plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, and had a handwritten list noting the names and addresses of other potential targets including Boris Johnson, who was then mayor of London.\nThat plot was said to have been inspired by al-Qaida.\nThe sentencing judge identified Khan and two others as \u201cthe more serious jihadists\u201d and said they should not be released until they were no longer a threat to the public.\nSadiq Khan, praised the \u201cbreathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran towards danger\u201d to stop the attacker. The mayor also thanked police who put their lives on the line.\nProf Stephen Toope, University of Cambridge vice-chancellor, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d at the targeting of the offender rehabilitation conference, which was organised by his university\u2019s criminology institute. \u201cWe mourn the dead and we hope for a speedy recovery for the injured.

The man, identified by the Metropolitan police as 28-year-old Usman Khan, fatally stabbed one man and one woman in an attack that began at a justice conference in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall about 2pm on Friday. Two other women and one man were injured and taken to hospital.\nThe Guardian understands Khan was attending the Learning Together conference, organised by the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Criminology, and began the attack while attendees were returning for the afternoon session. Footage showed members of the public grappling with a man on the north bank of the bridge before police intervened and shots were fired.\nThomas Gray, 24, told the PA news agency he helped five or six other people who had wrestled the man to the ground. \u201cI was brought up on rugby and the rule is \u2018one in, all in\u2019. I did what any Londoner would do and tried to put a stop to it.\u201d Gray said the man was carrying two knives that appeared to be \u201ctaped to his hands.\u201d He said he stomped on the man\u2019s left wrist while another man kicked the knife away.\nOther bystanders described seeing armed police officers surround the man, appear to look at his jacket, and then back away. Another video showed a body lying on the pavement with armed officers pointing their weapons from several metres away. The man was shot by specialist armed officers.\nThe Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick said the attack started at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall in the City of London, just by the northern end of London Bridge. Police were first called at 1.58pm and City of London police officers had confronted the suspect by 2.03pm. The police confirmed the suspect died at the scene and was wearing what upon later examination was believed to be a hoax suicide vest.\nAssistant commissioner Neil Basu said police were searching the Staffordshire residence where Khan had been living since his release from prison. \u201cThis individual was known to authorities, having been convicted in 2012 for terrorism offences. He was released from prison in December 2018 on licence and clearly, a key line of enquiry now is to establish how he came to carry out this attack.\u201d\nKhan served eight years for terrorism offences connected to a plot to blow up the London stock exchange. He was subject to monitoring conditions after his release and wearing an electronic tag. At his sentencing in 2012 the judge said Khan could pose an ongoing threat to public safety.\nIn 2017 eight people were killed and 48 injured when terrorists used a vehicle and knives to attack people on London Bridge and in nearby Borough Market.",

Light was fading. In that wild place the situation felt edgy. The vehicle followed me into the scenic layby that overlooks the upper gorge of the Afon Cynfal.\nIts driver watched as I walked over to the fence and peered into the dark ravine, within which thundered the rain-swollen waterfall of Rhaeadr y Cwm. A young man dressed in light-coloured clothes, he came over to talk. \u201cImpressive!\u201d I commented. \u201cOh yes!\u201d he responded, \u201cI work at the outdoor centre in Rhos y Gwaliau. We take our kids down it sometimes. We\u2019ve put bolts in for abseiling. It\u2019s very atmospheric in there!\u201d I tell him about working 50 years ago at an outdoor centre in Glasbury-on-Wye, leading groups of students through spectacular gorges of the Ystwyth and Rheidol around Devil\u2019s Bridge.\nWe talk of the committing situations encountered in these locations: of the sculpting of the rock; of green diffused light reflected off moving water and mossed walls; of the surprising depth both of clefts and the swirling cauldron-pools within them; of the dangerous thrill of moving through these arcane and rarely visited environments.\nAfter a few minutes he lifted the tailgate of his truck, took out a fly rod and said he was heading for Llyn y Morwynion. I related the Mabinogion story of how the handmaidens of Blodeuedd drowned there and how their mistress was turned into an owl, thereafter called Blodeuwedd (\u201cflower-face\u201d). In another folktale, women of Dyffryn Clwyd, abducted by men from Ardudwy in search of wives, drowned themselves here in despair after their male relatives caught up with and slaughtered the captors to whom they had become attached.\nThe young man\u2019s pale form flickered moth-like, mysterious, across the hillside in crepuscular light, \u201cClimbing up to a place / Where stone is dark under froth\u201d (Yeats).

The last time the US president was in the UK in June, he said that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d \u2013 including the NHS \u2013 in trade talks.\nIt is not yet clear if Corbyn himself will address the London demonstration, which will begin at around 4pm in Trafalgar Square. Confirmed speakers for the event include veteran activist Tariq Ali, musician Brian Eno, and Kate Hudson, the head of CND, although the Trump baby blimp is not expected to make a reappearance.\nThe Labour leader is expected to give a foreign policy speech on Sunday, aimed squarely at Trump, and has accused Johnson of putting the NHS \u201con the table\u201d in \u201csecret talks for a deal with Donald Trump after Brexit\u201d.\nOn Friday, Johnson responded, insisting that the NHS is \u201cnot for sale or up for negotiation\u201d in any future trade talks.\nTrump is arriving late on Monday night, leaving the president free time on Tuesday before the Palace reception for bilateral meetings but also media interviews, possibly with Piers Morgan on ITV or Nigel Farage on LBC.\nThe leaders \u2013 including, presumably Trump \u2013 will then go from Buckingham Palace to Downing Street for a second reception on Tuesday evening, this time hosted by Johnson. Downing Street has yet to release details, but other European leaders said they expected to be present.\nOn Wednesday the leaders will head to the luxury Grove hotel on the outskirts of Watford, a past base for England football teams ahead of World Cups, where Trump is scheduled to give a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, almost immediately after a separate press conference from Johnson.\nThe summit has already been deliberately stripped down so that its main purpose is ceremonial, focusing on the 70th anniversary of an alliance whose first headquarters was in the UK, to reduce the potential for diplomatic rows.\nReceptions and press events aside, its only substantive business is a three-hour session at the Grove hotel on Wednesday morning where each leader is due to speak for four minutes, a cumbersome format that Nato says acts as a useful opportunity to raise key points.\nNor is Trump the only complication. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is due to attend, a month after his country\u2019s invasion of the Kurdish region of Syria, and has already been sparring with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron.\nErdo\u011fan asked Macron to \u201ccheck whether you are brain dead\u201d after the French leader had argued that Nato was failing to provide strategic coordination between the US, Europe and Turkey.\nNonetheless, Nato officials were already expecting Trump to dominate proceedings. \u201cWhat can we do? It\u2019s a leaders summit after all,\u201d one said ahead of the meeting, although the question may be what topic will the unpredictable president chose to pick up.\nAt the last leaders\u2019 summit, in Brussels in July 2018, the US president ripped up the schedule, and demanded that Europeans spend more on defence \u2013 or the US would walk out of the 70-year military alliance and \u201cgo it alone\u201d.\nThis time Nato, eager to demonstrate concrete progress, released spending figures showing that allies increased defence spending by 4.6% in real terms, and that a growing minority of its 29 members were meeting long-term spending promises.\n\u201cMore allies are meeting the guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defence,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, told a press conference. \u201cThis year, nine allies will meet the guideline. Up from just three allies a few years ago.\u201d\nThe UK, at 2.1%, already meets the target, although the US spends 3.4%. But such efforts are unlikely to be enough to ensure a harmonious summit eight days before Britain goes to the polls.",

        "content": "London Bridge attacker was out of jail on licence after serving time over al-Qaida inspired plot with eight others\nUsman Khan, the suspect shot dead in the 29 November 2019 terror attack near London Bridge, had been released from jail after being convicted of terror offences, including plotting to attack the London Stock Exchange in 2010.\nKhan was part of a gang of nine extremists from Stoke-on-Trent, Cardiff and London who were sentenced in February 2012 at Woolwich crown court. He had planned to establish a \u201cterrorist military training facility\u201d on land owned by his family in Kashmir, according to sentencing remarks.\nKhan, at 19, was the youngest of the group. In his sentencing remarks Mr Justice Wilkie said Khan and two others were \u201cmore serious jihadis\u201d than the others.\nKhan was originally classed as never to be released unless deemed no longer a threat but this condition was later lifted.\nHe was freed on licence in December 2018.\nWilkie said Khan and his co-accused Nazam Hussain and Mohammed Shahjahan were planning to fund and establish the terrorist training school, with Khan and Hussain planning to leave the UK in January 2011 to train.\nKhan appealed against the decision in 2013 before Lord Justice Leveson, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Sweeney. It was decided that his sentence would go from 18 to 16 years, along with five-year extended licence periods.\nThe court of appeal judgment said: \u201cThe groups were clearly considering a range of possibilities including fundraising for the establishment of a military training madrasa in Pakistan, where they would undertake training themselves and recruit others to do likewise, sending letter bombs through the post, attacking public houses used by British racist groups, attacking a high-profile target with an explosive device and a Mumbai-style attack.\u201d\n Khan\u2019s lawyer, Joel Bennathan, said at the time of the offence his client was 19. Notes from the appeal hearing say: \u201cMr Bennathan put the matter on behalf of Khan in this way. At the time of the offence, he was a 19-year-old, whose ambition was to bring sharia law to Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, his ancestral home. The madrasa had not been built (and there was no evidence that there was any real funding to build it); he had no access to terrorist training and it was highly unrealistic to suppose that the authorities in Pakistan would allow a teenager from Stoke to impose sharia law or run a training school for terrorists.\u201d\nIt is also noted: \u201cConversation about bombing public houses in Stoke (in any event, not included within the allegation in the indictment) was no more than angry talk within some four minutes of young men responding to racist incidents in Stoke.\u201d\nIn a July 2013 report the independent reviewer of terrorism wrote that Khan was one of three men from Stoke who had travelled to Pakistan\u2019s federally administered tribal areas (Fata) and planned to fund, construct and take part in a terrorist training camp in Kashmir, with a view to carrying out terrorist acts in the future. They were part of a group that had copies of the al-Qaida English-language extremist magazine Inspire and had considered putting letter bombs in the post.\nThe extremists talked about setting off a pipe bomb in the toilets of the London Stock Exchange, as well as in pubs in Stoke, the Woolwich court heard. A handwritten target list belonging to the group listed the names and addresses of the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, the Dean of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, two rabbis, the US embassy in London and the stock exchange.\nGroup members were bugged and heard claiming that fewer than 100,000 Jews died in the Holocaust and talking about how Hitler had been on the same side as the Muslims because he understood that \u201cthe Jews were dangerous\u201d.\nKhan\u2019s then home in Persia Walk, Stoke-on-Trent, was bugged as he discussed plans for the firearms training camp, which was to be disguised as a legitimate madrasa, an Islamic religious school, Woolwich court heard. Discussing terrorist fundraising, he said Muslims in Britain could earn in a day what people in Kashmir, a disputed region divided between Pakistan and India, are paid in a month. He went on: \u201cOn jobseeker\u2019s allowance we can earn that, never mind working for that.\u201d\nThe sentencing judge, Wilkie, said the gang embarked on a \u201cserious, long-term venture in terrorism\u201d that could also have resulted in atrocities in Britain. He noted: \u201cIt was envisaged by them all that ultimately they and the other recruits may return to the UK as trained and experienced terrorists available to perform terrorist attacks in this country.\u201d\nThe men were mostly British citizens apart from two born in Bangladesh. The Met said at the time that the operation to round up the gang involved 1,000 police and staff at its height.",

        "content": "An exemplary critic, Clive laughed hard at himself and embraced his readers in their common failings\nClive James never failed to get a joke. Or to go on to make a better one. This wasn\u2019t because he was overly competitive: rather, like Dr Johnson, whom he often quoted, he believed that conversation obliged us to keep the ball in the air. People lacking the grace that is a sense of humour also lacked common sense, he once told Martin Amis. \u201cA sense of humour,\u201d he went on, \u201cis nothing but common-sense dancing.\u201d Since he loved the tango \u2013 perhaps because it, too, is conversation \u2013 it is hard not to put a picture to this. Only his was more than a common sense: it was a most uncommon genius for expressing subtle thought in the language of men speaking to men. The word for this isn\u2019t populism: for him it was, as a matter of principle, intellectual good manners.\nManners mattered to him. His talk was never coarse. Many years ago, at a dinner table, he told the woman sitting opposite him that he wanted to bite her. The woman was my wife. He was exhilarated after a successful television programme. We\u2019d all been drinking. And he was sending himself up. He knew his weakness. Countless times, in his final anguished poems, he punished himself for it, enumerating his wrongs, above all the wrong of inconstancy: \u201cI broke faith when it suited me.\u201d\nHis practice as a critic, which was to abolish distinctions between high and low (but not between good and bad) was exemplary. The catholicism of his interests made his television columns for the Observer not only the most enjoyable but also the most discussed critical writing of the time, and it diminished his capacity to tackle the tough stuff (as witness the brilliant erudition of Cultural Amnesia) not a jot. He wrote with great acumen and warmth about Barry Humphries, envying his \u201cwell-stocked mind\u201d and then reminding himself he should be envying his talent too. But that didn\u2019t stop him taking exception to the character of Sir Les Patterson, the provocation for whose savage invention continued to escape him. On Germaine Greer\u2019s The Female Eunuch he praised the \u201cfine, continuous flow of its angry power\u201d, while taking issue with her assumption that it was every woman\u2019s job to be politicised. \u201cFor most people,\u201d he wrote, \u201cconformity is a blessing\u201d \u2013 a remark that goes to the heart of his temper, and explains why he was always too intelligently benign to be a revolutionary.\nBut with Germaine, as with Barry, he didn\u2019t forget to be funny about envy, admitting to the difficulty of dealing with a contemporary becoming the most famous person in the world. The gleeful candour of his poem The Book of my Enemy Has Been Remaindered won him many friends. Clive\u2019s early memoirs were loved because he laughed so hard at himself, and because he embraced his readers in their common failings. If he suspected other men\u2019s ideologies, it was because he knew that ideologues were icy, divisive and, more often than not, mendacious.\nDid he throw a part of himself away on television? In an interview I did with him, he didn\u2019t so much dodge the question as refuse to entertain it. How could television, which more truly held the mirror up to culture than any other medium, be thought of as a waste? But it has to be asked whether Clive\u2019s gifts were adequately appreciated. He was too variously gifted. As well as his work on television he wrote song lyrics, satiric poetry, novels, memoirs, books of essays, reviews. In his last years he translated Dante. So the question can take another form: was his versatility that of someone running to prove that one could be simultaneously popular and serious? And that question raises a further: what would one have had from him that was different?\nIf anything, he exceeded the brilliance of his early promise and demonstrated, in his own extraordinarily various career, that literature is never truer to itself than when it operates in the messy present, away from all ivory towers, down here among the unweeded passions of humanity.",

        "content": "Readers accuse the firm of falling standards after private equity buyout and shift in production\nIt was just a small question in our regular Consumer Champions column. Why, a reader asked, had her \u00a3170 Dr Martens boots fallen apart after just six months? The response was huge, with readers accusing the bootmaker of sacrificing quality, offshoring production and chasing profits under the ownership of a London-based private equity company a long way from its roots in Northamptonshire.\nMuch of the response was emotional: from the moment the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend scissor-kicked his way on stage in 1967 wearing eight-eyes boots, through to the height of punk, wearing Dr Martens has been a symbol of British working-class subculture. The company\u2019s shift to China, factory closures in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Somerset, and a takeover by private equity, seem symbolic of what has happened to the British economy since then. Yes, there\u2019s still a \u201cMade in England\u201d label on some Dr Martens \u2013 but today only 2% of its shoes are manufactured in England, with everything else moved to Asia.\nSo has there really been a decline in quality? Many Guardian readers think so. One sent us pictures of her poorly stitched boots. \u201cI bought the limited edition Lazy Oaf X boots for \u00a3180, two out of the three boots we ordered have broken! I have previous pairs of Dr Martens which have lasted me five-plus years so I know I haven\u2019t \u2018worn them out\u2019.\u201d\nAnother reader, CH, says: \u201cI purchased cherry red shoes and within eight months the sole was coming away from the shoe. Sadly Dr M\u2019s workmanship and quality is not as good as it once was.\u201d\nQBC from London wrote to Dr Martens, alleging: \u201cYour production standards have dropped. The previous pair had a moulded insole that could be removed from the boot and fitted perfectly right into the toe of the boot. The replacement pair has a glued-in flat-foam insole which leaves a gap between it and the inside of the boot. Not only that but the leather that comprises the tongue is 0.2mm thinner \u2013 1.4mm compared to 1.6mm of the previous pair.\u201d\nBut Dr Martens\u2019 chief executive, Kenny Wilson, who joined in 2018 from the home furnishing store Cath Kidston, robustly rejects the allegations. \u201cWhile we produce around 11m pairs of shoes a year and have a very low rate of defects (0.5% of our total), we accept and acknowledge that we don\u2019t get it right all the time. In these cases we work very hard to understand what happened and learn from it.\u201d\nThe chief operating officer, Geert Peeters, says the shoes are still all welted, the leather has not changed and production standards have not slipped. The materials suppliers have not changed for decades and there is stringent quality control, the company says. It denies that the leather is thinner, and says shoe construction remains the same as on 1 April 1960, the day the 1460 boot was named and first made.\nHas the move to factories in China sent quality spiralling? One commentator alleges: \u201cAs any Dr Martens aficionado knows, the quality plummeted when they moved most production out of the UK. I have two otherwise identical pairs of Dr Martens boots \u2013 one UK made, one Chinese-made \u2013 and while the UK-made ones are among the most comfortable footwear I own, the Chinese-made ones [are]made of nasty, rigid, thinner leather \u2026 in this case the manufacturer apparently sacrificed quality for profit, and its customers are paying the price in bunions and blisters.\u201d\nNot true, says Dr Martens. The shift to Asia was in 2004, so it\u2019s by no means a recent development. It says the production methods used in its Asian factories are identical to those at its base in England, and that you could pick up an operator in one of its Asia factories and shift them to England, and all the processes would be exactly the same \u201call the way down to putting the lid on the box\u201d.\nOther critics say it is not China that\u2019s the problem, but its new owners. Dr Martens is now owned by Permira, a \u00a330bn group headquartered in Pall Mall, London, which bought it in 2013 from the Griggs family for \u00a3300m.\n\u201cThe stitching came apart on my slip-on boots. Take a brand, hand it over to venture capitalists, who then slash costs and pimp image,\u201d was the view of one reader.\nCritics of private equity firms say they typically make deep cuts to jobs and operating costs then sell the business off five or six years later for a quick profit. Indeed, one Labour MP said in 2007 it was a \u201cnational scandal that the casino capitalists from global private equity groups are allowed to treat British workers and some of our biggest companies as nothing more than pawns in a game of get rich quick\u201d. Those were the words of John McDonnell, then a lowly backbench MP who no one thought might one day be a serious contender to become chancellor of the exchequer.\nBut the company says it is a fiction that there has been cost cutting or asset stripping. \u201cOur growth story is driven by investment. Operating expenses grew by 30% last year, and for the period of Permira\u2019s ownership, investment in operating expenses has been larger than revenue growth. And we have just made a big investment in our factory in England to double production.\u201d\nYet what is also apparent from the response to our story is how many readers were recommending a brand called Solovair instead. Its shoes are strikingly similar to Dr Martens, and they are all made in England. The company made Dr Martens shoes under licence for 35 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around since 1881 in Northamptonshire, and in 2006 were bought out by a local person who saved the company and kept all 60 employees in their jobs. We\u2019re still very small compared with Dr Martens, but we\u2019re growing fast.\u201d",

        "content": "Apparent targeting of family whose relative was convicted of terror attack prompts accusations of \u2018collective punishment\u2019\nA New Yorker who gained US citizenship as a child is suddenly facing deportation, along with several green card-holding members of his family, after apparent targeting by the Trump administration in what the family believes is a clear case of anti-Muslim bias.\nNone of the individuals have a criminal record, and say the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only raised questions about the validity of their immigration status after another relative was arrested following a terrorist incident in the city. The government\u2019s actions have alarmed advocates and led to them accusing officials of meting out unfair \u201ccollective punishment\u201d.\nAhsan Ullah, 32, an electrician from Brooklyn, was placed in immigration detention in Kearny, New Jersey, on 22 October. He spent about four weeks separated from his American wife and three children before being released on bond last Tuesday pending the outcome of his case.\nFour of his relatives, who all hold green cards, are also fighting government efforts to strip them of their US residency status. Since Trump came into office, the number of such denaturalization and citizenship revocation cases filed by DHS has surged.\n\u201cCitizenship is permanently conditional for many people who were not born here,\u201d said Fahd Ahmed, executive director of the advocacy group Desis Rising Up and Moving (Drum), which has been providing support to the Ullah family.\n\u201cAt a time when we are seeing a white nationalist current in government and society that wants to depopulate communities of color from this country, these cases are an indication of how their tactics and attacks are evolving.\u201d\nAhsan was born in Bangladesh and adopted by his uncle at a young age, the family said.\nAfter the uncle won a US visa through the diversity lottery program, Ahsan was granted a green card. He migrated to the US at eight years old and became a citizen several years later.\nMeanwhile, his uncle successfully petitioned to bring his sister, Ahsan\u2019s biological mother and four siblings to the country as permanent residents in 2011.\nThe family assumed their future in the US was secure. They focused on going to school, building careers and starting families. Ahsan became an electrician, got married and had three children.\nBut everything changed in December 2017, when one of Ahsan\u2019s brothers, Akayed, was arrested for detonating a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City subway station. He was the only person injured, in what was seen as a botched attack.\nFamily members both in the US and Bangladesh were questioned and none was found to have assisted the 27-year-old or to be supportive of terrorist organizations. Akayed was convicted of several terrorism offenses in 2018 and will be sentenced in February.\nSherin, Ahsan\u2019s wife, 30, said that the day Akayed was arrested the rest of the family was utterly shocked to learn what he had done.\n\u201cFor at least three, four months we were in disbelief,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think [Akayed] was capable of this.\u201d\nFrom the moment of Akayed\u2019s arrest, other family members say that despite being cleared by law enforcement, they began to see consequences.\nAhsan recounted receiving a letter from the bank notifying him that his personal and business banking accounts would be closed, and that the FBI put his business license on hold.\nWary clients cancelled their contracts, he said. His mother and siblings would see New York police department squad cars parked regularly near their building and other places they frequented, including their mosque, which they had never remembered seeing before.\nThen, in April 2019, Ahsan received a letter out of the blue from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), part of the DHS, stating that the agency planned to cancel his US citizenship on the grounds it was not lawfully obtained.\nIn a panic, his mother and siblings applied for citizenship but soon received news that not only had their application been denied but that the DHS intended to revoke their green cards. On 6 November, Ullah\u2019s mother and one of his sisters were detained for two days.\n\u201cAfter all this time, we [had] mentally and physically bonded with this country, and love this country so much,\u201d said Ayfa, Ahsan\u2019s 22-year-old sister, the day she was released from detention. \u201cHow can you disown a person just like that?\u201d\nThe family is now trying to fight the agency\u2019s orders.\nIn paperwork issued to the family, which was reviewed by the Guardian, the DHS claims that Ahsan, his mother and siblings have no legal or biological relationship to the uncle whose original success in the green card lottery facilitated the others\u2019 settling in the US. Lawyers for the family said they are gathering the paperwork to prove their relationships.\nThe family and their advocates said the treatment amounts to collective punishment. \u201cThis is retribution for sharing the same DNA\u201d as someone accused of terrorism, Ahsan said in a phone call from the Hudson county correctional facility in New Jersey, just before his release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here [in the US] since I was a kid \u2013 my school is here, my college is here, my family is here, my business is here, my friends are here, my career is here,\u201d he said . \u201cThis is where my everything is.\u201d\nDHS declined to comment on the family\u2019s case.\nWhat\u2019s happening to the Ullah family is not an isolated case. A report by the Open Society Justice Initiative in September found that the Trump administration has filed three times more civil denaturalization cases, about 30 a year \u2013 stripping Americans of their citizenship \u2013 than the average annual number pursued under the eight preceding presidents.\nNearly half of all persons targeted for denaturalization in 2017 and 2018 came from \u201cspecial interest\u201d countries, a label used to identify nations with presumed links to terrorism, including Bangladesh, the report said, which amounted to a policy of \u201ccollective suspicion\u201d.\nManar Waheed, senior legislative and advocacy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the data indicates that \u201cthe same communities that this administration has targeted over and over again\u201d are being singled out.\nAhsan said that while he was in detention, he missed the moment when his seven-month-old son said \u201cBaba\u201d for the first time.\n\u201cI\u2019m just surprised by all this,\u201d Ahsan said, speaking from the detention facility before he was released on bond. \u201cI pay my taxes, I\u2019ve never done anything wrong, I try to be a model citizen, and I\u2019m here [in detention].\u201d\nThe administration has threatened to deport the family members unless they can prove their relationships are what they have long claimed and had not been challenged by the authorities before.\nThe family is hoping they can reverse the Trump administration action by submitting challenges to the USCIS appeals office, contesting their deportation orders in immigration court and, if necessary, filing civil motions in federal court.\nBut they are dismayed by the turn of events, and very nervous.\nSherin said: \u201cYou can play everything by the book and they\u2019ll still get you.\u201d",

        "content": "Introduction of three-in-one pill hailed as a \u2018game-changer\u2019 in efforts to treat 7.7 million South Africans with HIV\nSouth Africa has begun rolling out a state-of-the-art antiretroviral drug in a \u201cgame-changing\u201d bid to drastically reduce the number of people living with HIV.\nThe distribution of the new three-in-one pill, timed to coincide with World Aids Day on Sunday, is eventually expected to treat the 7.7 million South Africans who have HIV, accounting for 20% of the global prevalence of the disease.\nDescribed by South Africa\u2019s health minister, Zweli Mkhize, as \u201cthe fastest way to reduce HIV viral load\u201d, the fixed-dose combination has fewer side effects and is easier to take than other formulations. One of the main ingredients, dolutegravir, is already the drug of choice in higher income countries.\n\u201cThe introduction of this new regimen, known as TLD, is a major milestone and game-changer for South Africa, which has the highest burden of HIV of any country in the world,\u201d said Robert Matiru of the global health development organisation Unitaid, which financed the drug\u2019s development.\n\u201cThe government has the very ambitious plan of switching the 4.8 million South Africans who are currently on the older regimen of HIV treatment on to this new regimen by 2021, in addition to getting the remaining [roughly] 3 million people who are not currently on HIV treatment on to this regimen by then as well. It\u2019s a massive undertaking to put in place, and is a really welcome move for the people of South Africa.\u201d\nMatiru said savings created by transferring those already receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs) to the new, cheaper regimen could allow up to 5 million more people to receive treatment.\nSouth Africa accounts for more than 10% of all HIV-related deaths and 15% of new infections globally, according to Unitaid. Only 62% of those living with HIV in South Africa are currently on treatment and fewer than 50% of young South Africans who come forward for HIV care successfully initiate ARV therapy.\nThe country\u2019s introduction of the TLD regimen is likely to have a far-reaching impact on HIV incidence in South Africa as well as the global response, said Dr Michelle Moorhouse, of Ezintsha, Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg.\n\u201cWe are likely to see a dramatic impact on the rate of new infections,\u201d said Moorhouse. \u201cIn fact, moving to DTG could halve the number of new infections in South Africa between now and 2038, especially if we get people on treatment more quickly. And as HIV in South Africa accounts for about 20% of infections globally, this impacts the global infection rate.\u201d\nJust 24.5 million of the estimated 37.9 million people living worldwide with HIV are currently on ARVs, said Matiru. \u201cOnce South Africa scales up its response to include the 3 million who aren\u2019t currently on treatment, that will help close the global gap.\u201d\nAlthough global HIV infections among adults have dropped by 17% since 2010, the decline is far short of the 60% drop required in 2018 to meet global HIV prevention targets, according to the Global HIV Prevention Coalition. Just 28 countries account for 75% of all new HIV infections globally, according to a report published by the coalition in October \u2013 and some of them, including Nigeria and Pakistan, have shown a troubling increase in infections.\nA dozen countries have reduced new adult HIV infections by 26% or more since 2010, including South Africa (39%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (37%), Uganda (36%), and Zimbabwe (28%).\nHowever, in Nigeria, new adult HIV infections increased by 8% from 2010, while in Pakistan new adult HIV infections rose by a staggering 56%.\nTabitha Ha, advocacy manager at StopAids, said: \u201cDespite progress over the past few decades, HIV infection rates are still increasing at alarming rates in places such as Pakistan and South Sudan, and in regions such as eastern Europe.\n\u201cThis means we are off track in meeting our global goal target to end Aids by 2030. While some countries are stepping up the fight, others are lagging way behind.\n\u201cGlobal prevention efforts need to be ramped up urgently in order to get us back on track and offer us the opportunity to turn the tide. We must collectively increase our financial investment in prevention tools, break down stigma and discrimination, as well as remove the legal and structural barriers that prevent people most likely to be affected with HIV from accessing healthcare.\u201d",

        "content": "As the winter approaches the northern hemisphere, novelist Amy Sackville shares her favourite books about one of Earth\u2019s remaining wildernesses\nIce is just cold, solid water, of course; essential for cocktails, and the survival of the planet. One-tenth of Earth\u2019s land surface is covered in it, and up to 15% of the ocean for part of the year; one quarter of the land has ice buried in it year round. This unique substance \u2013 volatile, ancient, quick, slow, frightening and beautiful \u2013 creates spaces at the reaches of the earth and of the imagination that we can\u2019t resist returning to. It invites simile. It slips out of our grasp.\nTarjei Vesaas\u2019s unsettling and lovely novel The Ice Palace, translated from the Norwegian by Elizabeth Rokkan, tells the story of an intense, half-understood bond between Siss and Unn, two schoolgirls. Full of longing and desire, \u201cfull of the unknown\u201d, it is as dream-like and powerful as the frozen waterfall at its centre. Unn is lost, enchanted and disoriented by the chambers of this palace, by turns hostile and magnificent, and far too cold.\nAnother short, strange novel of the 60s, Anna Kavan\u2019s Ice is more nightmare than dream. It is set in a world of nameless, ruined cities, freezing seas and dark forests, in which some obscure disaster has precipitated environmental collapse. Communication is failing, the media can\u2019t be trusted, conflict is rife, and ice is closing in, destroying everything in its path. The book falls somewhere between compelling spy thriller and cold war Kafka \u2013 there are overcoats, paranoia, police states and a white-haired girl that the narrator is senselessly pursuing \u2026\nAccounts of polar expeditions are typically preoccupied by the impossible task of describing the infinite forms and variety, as well as the overwhelming magnitude, of the ice. The poles are the perfect realms in which to find the sublime. Francis Spufford\u2019s first book, I May Be Some Time, traces the history of polar exploration and its place in the cultural imagination, in particular the attempts by explorers such as William Parry, John Franklin and Robert Falcon Scott to capture their experience. The book moves towards a vivid and chilling re-creation of that fateful expedition and those famous last words.\nJoanna Kavenna\u2019s The Ice Museum is another work of non-fiction that pursues the idea of a remote, half-imagined north. Kavenna writes brilliantly about bleak, inhospitable places, and about the dangerous ideologies that can be written on the seeming blank page of a lost northern land \u2013 Thule has a place in Nazi mythology as the home of the Aryan race. She meets people who are struggling at the edges of the ice: displaced Inuit in Greenland, and environmental scientists on Svalbard, who measure the melting ice.\nBarry Lopez\u2019s seminal work of nature writing Arctic Dreams finds his exacting, luminous prose focusing on the landscape of the north, the animals that live there and the peoples who populate it, on the complex beauty of the ways that life and landscape co-exist, and the fragility of that compact. The magnificent chapter \u201cIce and Light\u201d is a study of the formation, appearance and varieties of Arctic ice. Written in the 1980s, this is a gorgeous yet austere, unsentimental book, which offers a prescient warning about human complacency towards Earth\u2019s remaining wilderness.\n Painter to the King by Amy Sackville is published by Granta.",

You could not work and you could not get paid; you were told it was not safe.\u201d\nMatthew Wilson, a teacher at the nearby Kaplan International College, and his long-time friend Ankit Panda, a banker, had been buying lunch from a stall when they heard shouting and police sirens.\n\u201cMatthew had been asking me to come to Borough Market for lunch for six months now,\u201d Panda said, \u201cand I was working from home today and thought: \u2018OK, why not? It\u2019s a quiet Friday.\u2019\u201d\nThe pair got caught up in a panicked charge. Panda said: \u201cAn older lady fell over in front of us and this tells you something of the adrenaline of the situation: no one stopped, everyone ran over her. We didn\u2019t even stop. It was a stampede, people were running and trying to run in buildings and hide behind bins. Some people were trying to break into a construction workers\u2019 cabin to hide in there. We didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d\nWilson, who lost his shoe in the chaos, said: \u201cYou hear about the sheer panic of these situations but when you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re going on instinct and so everyone was just running away. Your brain works in strange ways; I went back and found my shoe from the market. I even picked my box of mac and cheese back up which I\u2019d dumped on top of a bin when we were running. But it was weirdly calm afterwards. It happened so quick.\u201d\nThe two ran into the college, where a metal fire curtain came down and students and staff were kept on lockdown. Pubs, restaurants and offices were told to keep their doors shut.\nStaff at the fast food chain Chicken Cottage said they helped a woman who ran in from the street before pulling the shutters down. \u201cShe was panicked and we could see so many people running, that\u2019s why we knew something was going down,\u201d said one employee who did not want to be named. \u201cThe last time this happened, we got leaflets about staying alert and aware. It\u2019s sad people have been hurt and killed. It is scary, I don\u2019t feel safe in this area, it\u2019s why I work the day shift.\u201d\nHemal, the newsagent at Classic News, closed his doors after an employee came running down from the bridge. \u201cWe didn\u2019t close the shop [completely] because we have our local customers and we couldn\u2019t refuse them, some are homeless people and they were afraid.\u201d Was he scared? \u201cNo, why would I be scared? So many police were here and they handled it.\u201d",

        "content": "Jeanne Calment was 122 when she died. But last year a Russian scientist claimed she was a con artist, sparking an international dispute over the woman who may still hold the secret to eternal life\nIf time makes fools of us all, you couldn\u2019t blame Andr\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Raffray for taking it more personally than most. In 1965, Raffray, a lawyer in the southern French city of Arles, thought he had hit on the real-estate version of a sure thing. The 47-year-old had signed a contract to buy an apartment from one of his clients \u201cen viager\u201d: a form of property sale by which the buyer makes a monthly payment until the seller\u2019s death, when the property becomes theirs. His client, Jeanne Calment, was 90 and sprightly for her age; she liked to surprise people by leaping from her chair at the hairdresser. But still, it couldn\u2019t be long: Raffray just had to shell out 2,500 francs a month and wait it out.\nHe never got to live there. Raffray died in 1995, aged 77, by which time Calment was 120 and one of the most famous women in France. She hadn\u2019t lived in the rooms she owned above the Maison Calment, the drapery shop once run by her husband in the heart of Arles, for a decade. Instead, as each birthday thrust her further into the realm of the improbable, Calment held court at La Maison du Lac, the retirement home next to the city hospital. She had no immediate family \u2013 her husband, daughter and grandson were long dead \u2013 but journalists and local notables would regularly visit for an audience. \u201cI waited 110 years to be famous. I mean to make the most of it,\u201d she was reported to have said. One party piece was recounting how, as a teenager, she had met Vincent van Gogh; he was ugly and dishevelled, she said, and locals called him \u201cthe dingo\u201d.\nThe pensioner appeared blessed with the stamina of Methuselah. Still cycling at 100, she only gave up smoking at 117; her doctors concluded that she had a mental capacity equivalent to most octogenarians. Enough, at any rate, to coin the odd zinger: \u201cI wait for death\u2026 and journalists,\u201d she once told a reporter. Aged 121, she recorded a rap CD, Mistress of Time. But even this \u201cMichael Jordan of ageing\u201d, as one geriatrician put it, had only so much road to run. By 1996, she was in steep decline. Using a wheelchair, largely blind and deaf, she finally succumbed on 4 August 1997. At 122, hers was the oldest validated human lifespan in history.\nSome, though, believe it\u2019s not just time that makes fools of us all. Last year, a Russian mathematician called Nikolay Zak made an astonishing claim: that it was not Jeanne Calment who died in 1997, but her daughter, Yvonne. Sceptical about the degree to which Calment had surpassed previous record-holders (the nearest verified claim at the time was 117), Zak had dug into her biography and uncovered a host of inconsistencies. First published on Researchgate, a scientific social networking site, then picked up by bloggers and the Associated Press news agency, Zak\u2019s paper claimed that Jeanne Calment had actually died in 1934; according to official records, this was when Yvonne had lost her life, aged 36, to pleurisy. At this point, Zak alleged, her daughter had assumed her identity \u2013 they looked similar \u2013 and she kept up the pretence for more than 60 years.\nWhen the paper went viral, the French press exploded. How dare someone slur a national treasure, the woman dubbed \u201cla doyenne de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\u201d? And who was this upstart Russian anyway? Zak wasn\u2019t even a gerontologist, a specialist in ageing, but a 36-year-old mathematics graduate who worked as a glassblower at Moscow State University and hadn\u2019t published a paper in 10 years.\nZak doubled down in response. He published an expanded paper in the US-based journal Rejuvenation Research, in January this year. It compiled a dossier of 17 pieces of biographical evidence supporting the \u201cswitch\u201d theory, including inexplicable physical differences between the young and old Jeanne (a change in eye colour from \u201cdark\u201d to green) and discrepancies in the verbal testimonies she gave while in the retirement home: she claimed to have met Van Gogh in her father\u2019s shop, when Jeanne\u2019s father had been a shipbuilder. He also claimed there had been no public celebration of Jeanne\u2019s 100th birthday, a key reference point in old-age validations.\nAs Zak admitted, there was no smoking gun; but together these pieces of circumstantial evidence did emit a fair amount of smoke. Crucially, he suggested a plausible motive: that Yvonne had taken her mother\u2019s place in order to avoid punitive inheritance taxes, which during the interwar period ran as high as 35%.\nThe debate spread through the French press and international gerontological circles, becoming increasingly heated. Many dismissed Zak\u2019s switch theory as Russian-sponsored \u201cfake news\u201d, as the newspaper Le Parisien put it. Certainly, it seemed to be an attack on western science. As well as Calment, Zak expressed doubts about the validation of Sarah Knauss, a Pennsylvanian insurance office manager who had died in 1999, aged 119, putting her in the silver-medal position behind Calment. Was the Russian trying to sow doubt, so that his countrymen could take the lead in the gerontology field?\nFor the people of Arles, it was a matter of local pride. They quickly rallied behind Calment and formed a Facebook group, the Counter-Investigation into the Jeanne Calment Investigation, to dismantle Zak\u2019s claims. Their members included Calment\u2019s distant relatives, and others who had known her; although some said she had been haughty and waspish, they didn\u2019t want her reputation sullied. They had easy access to the city\u2019s archives, while Zak had never been to Arles: what could he know? He shot back, on their open counter-investigation forum: perhaps the \u201cArl\u00e9siens\u201d were just blinded by their allegiances. \u201cNote that from a distance it is obvious that the Earth is not flat,\u201d he wrote.\nBoth camps were equally adamant. One, that the woman who died in the Maison du Lac was the longest-lived human being. The other, that she was a gifted and almost inconceivably determined con artist. Which was the real Madame Calment?\nAn age of 122 seems to defy the limits of the possible. Even two decades later, with average lifespans still rising, no one has come within touching distance of Jeanne Calment. In the supercentenarian league \u2013 110 and above \u2013 the three-year gap between her and Knauss might as well be an aeon.\nIn 1825, the British actuary Benjamin Gompertz came up with a prediction model for human mortality, one which estimated that the risk of death increased exponentially with age, doubling every eight years. His \u201cGompertz curve\u201d was quickly taken up by the insurance industry. In the year after a 100th birthday, the chance of death is roughly 50%. Knowing this, Calment\u2019s record looks even more of a statistical long shot.\nIn Arles\u2019s Trinquetaille cemetery, there is little to mark out the person with the world\u2019s longest lucky streak, apart from the small book-shaped plinth engraved \u201cLa doyenne de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\u201d on her tomb. When I visit in the last days of August, summer has checked out early; the sky is overcast, the first autumn leaves are on the ground. On the mottled, dark-grey marble of Calment\u2019s family tomb stands a pot of fake chrysanthemums and a yellowing succulent. Curiously, Joseph Billot, Jeanne\u2019s son-in-law and Yvonne\u2019s husband, and her grandson Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Billot are marked, but her daughter is not. Yet the cemetery guardian, in a hut a few metres away, assures me that Yvonne is buried with her mother.\nIn a hotel garden next to Arles\u2019s Roman amphitheatre, I meet three members of the counter-investigation Facebook group: Colette Barb\u00e9, C\u00e9cile Pellegrini and Brigitte Jajcaj. I mention that it seems odd that Jeanne did not put her own daughter\u2019s name on the family tomb; was it Yvonne who decided not to, trying to tell us she was still alive? \u201cOh, so you followed her all the way to the cemetery, then?\u201d jokes Barb\u00e9. Don\u2019t overthink it, the women say. The grave wasn\u2019t renovated until the 1960s, shortly after Calment\u2019s son-in-law and grandson died (the latter in a car crash); by then, Yvonne had been dead for 30 years, and Jeanne only had the most recent deaths engraved.\nThey are an incongruous trio of detectives: Pellegrini, the group administrator, is a quick, ironic speaker whose half-Vietnamese grandfather opened the city\u2019s first Asian restaurant; Jajcaj has swept-back grey hair, a rose shoulder tattoo and a black-tasselled padlock on a chain around her neck; Barb\u00e9 is a strong-minded bourgeoise, vibrantly attired and draped in jewellery. The counter-investigation has 1,500 members, drawn from all over the globe, although the core group is made up of proud locals. \u201c[Calment] was this elegant lady, even with a cane \u2013 an emblem of Arles,\u201d says Jajcaj. \u201cShe held herself perfectly upright at 102, which was beautiful.\u201d\nSoon after Zak\u2019s paper was published, the group began to scour local archives for evidence that undermined his theory. Distant members of the Calment and Billot families opened up their photo albums and personal papers. In the spirit of open debate, Zak was also accepted on to the forum, where he kept up a running commentary on the new findings. He was collegiate on the surface, acknowledging that he and the counter-investigation had a shared goal: the truth. But over time they felt his attitude \u2013 demanding people chase after evidence on his behalf, unfailingly using it to back up his own theory \u2013 begin to rankle. \u201cSometimes I get the impression that he thinks he understands our way of life and history better than us,\u201d says Barb\u00e9.\nBut digging into the past began to pay dividends. One new photograph donated by a family member showed Yvonne posing on a balcony with a parasol against a mountain backdrop. Clever sleuthing with postcards and Google Maps revealed it to be part of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland \u2013 consistent with Yvonne\u2019s diagnosis of pleurisy, often a symptom of tuberculosis. Another document seemed to confirm the gravity of her condition: her husband, Joseph, an army colonel, was granted five years of compassionate leave in June 1928 to look after her. Unfortunately, the sanatorium closed in 1960, and its records haven\u2019t survived.\nIf the switch did take place, maintaining this fiction in plain sight would have required an extraordinary and queasy level of deception. Yvonne would have had to share a house with Jeanne\u2019s widower, Fernand, her own father, until his death in 1942; Fernand would have had to pass his daughter off as his wife. Yvonne would have had to force her son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, seven when \u201cJeanne\u201d died, to stop calling her \u201cMaman\u201d.\nMany others would need to have been complicit. If Zak knew either the people of Arles or Jeanne Calment, the group argued, he would realise how improbable this was. A conspiracy would have been difficult to maintain in a close-knit population of 20,000, and unlikely given Mme Calment\u2019s reputation as a \u201cdragon\u201d, says Pellegrini. \u201cIf people had known about the fraud, they wouldn\u2019t have protected her,\u201d she says.\nPerhaps the most important blow from the counter-investigation group \u2013 not quite a mortal one, but close \u2013 was attacking Zak\u2019s idea of a financial motive. The Russian had claimed Yvonne was trying to escape a 35% inheritance tax, but the group\u2019s research led them to believe it would have been more like 6-7% \u2013 a rate the family could have managed, with Fernand Calment\u2019s considerable assets.\nBut Zak refused to budge. Only a DNA test, either from Trinquetaille cemetery or a sample of Calment\u2019s blood, rumoured to be stored in a Paris research institute, would settle the matter, he argued. But the women from the counter-investigation group believe he has gone too far down the rabbit hole to consider any theory but his own. \u201cEven if [a DNA test] proves it was Jeanne, he\u2019ll never accept it,\u201d says Pellegrini. \u201cHe\u2019ll say the tests were rigged.\u201d\nThere is some debate about what happens to rates of mortality in extreme old age. Some researchers believe they continue to rise with the Gompertz curve, until the risk of death in a given year is absolute \u2013 with an effective ceiling to human life somewhere between 119 and 129. Others believe there is no such ceiling, thanks to a phenomenon known as \u201cmortality deceleration\u201d: the plateauing of the death rate after 105. But there are doubts about this plateau, too, due to the frequent misreporting of supercentenarians (mostly due to clerical error, rather than fraud). With such a small dataset even a few errors can skew our understanding of human limits (the Gerontology Research Group, based in Los Angeles, estimates that there are about 1,000 living supercentenarians).\nThe validation of Jeanne Calment\u2019s age, though, is regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d by Jean-Marie Robine, the man who helped carry it out. I meet him at his home in the village of Pignan, just west of Montpellier. Long legs stretched out in aquamarine board shorts under his kitchen table, the researcher still has matinee-idol looks at 68. His work with Calment, carried out as a demographer for the French state organisation Inserm (L\u2019Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale), \u201cnever had validating her age as a mandate,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was to validate the quality of the administrative documents that attested to her age. And from what we had at our disposal, there was nothing dubious.\u201d He points at the unbroken chain of 30 censuses \u2013 every five years up until 1946, then every seven to eight \u2013 that chronicle Jeanne Calment\u2019s life in Arles.\nOnly one \u2013 the 1931 census \u2013 was puzzling. Yvonne is not listed as resident in the family\u2019s Arles apartment, which Zak takes to mean that she was already living semi-secluded in the family\u2019s country house, 10 miles away in the village of Paradou. He argues that she would masquerade as her mother, in order that Jeanne, the one who was really suffering from tuberculosis, could avoid the disease\u2019s social stigma. Robine has a simpler explanation: that Yvonne was at the sanatorium at Leysin.\nHe is scathing about the Russian theory, flatly dismissing it as \u201cpseudo-science\u201d. But he and his co-validator, Michel Allard, have been criticised by Zak, and by some on the counter-investigation forum, for not being more thorough in their own corroborations. They did, however, conduct a series of nearly 40 interviews with Calment at the Maison du Lac, asking for details of her life that only she would know. She made some slips, unsurprisingly for her age, often mixing up her father and husband. (Zak jumped on such mistakes in excerpts of the transcripts later published in a book.) But many other details, such as the names of maids and teachers, largely tallied with the information recorded in censuses and school registers.\nRobine is softly spoken, but it is hard to get a word in edgeways as he builds his argument. I mention the idea that a DNA test on Calment\u2019s blood could settle the debate. Jeanne\u2019s husband Fernand was her distant cousin, so Yvonne had more ancestors common to both sides of her family than her mother \u2013 something that would be visible in her DNA. Robine can barely hold back his indignation at the suggestion of DNA testing. \u201cWhat are we going to do \u2013 just hand it over to the Russians? To an international committee? To do what? These people are caught up in magical thinking \u2013 that the secret of longevity is in her genes.\u201d\nBy August 2019, l\u2019affaire Calment had settled into a stalemate. When I speak to Zak over Skype at his dacha on the Ukrainian border, he seems more determined than ever: \u201cWith so much opposition, I want to prove that I am right,\u201d he says. There is a flash of intellectual pride behind his poker-face. Boyish in a blue polo shirt with tousled hair, a slight smile occasionally breaks his composure. \u201cSome people don\u2019t care about facts. So they just hate those who disagree with them,\u201d he shrugs.\nGerontology had originally been a hobby for Zak. He was interested in the ageing process of the naked mole-rat, an animal with an improbably long lifespan of about 30 years. But he became caught up in the Calment case after making contact on Facebook with Valery Novoselov, head of gerontology at the Moscow Society of Naturalists (MOIP), who had longstanding suspicions about her. Novoselov\u2019s case had been based largely on photographic analysis; he encouraged Zak, who spoke some French, to delve into other aspects, such as biographical and archival evidence. Zak says he had no intention of publishing anything \u2013 until he contacted Jean-Marie Robine about the \u201cproblems\u201d he had found. \u201cHe always had some excuse about why he couldn\u2019t reply, which I thought was strange,\u201d says Zak. \u201cIt was this that made me carry on.\u201d (Robine disputes that he was evasive, saying he corresponded extensively with Zak in October 2018.)\nMeanwhile, others were beginning to have doubts about Zak and Novoselov. Robert Young, who validates supercentenarians for Guinness World Records, believes the attack on Jeanne Calment is a deliberate attempt to sow doubt about western scientific methods, amounting to \u201cacademic fraud\u201d. He points to what he sees as Zak\u2019s obstinate refusal to consider any scenario other than the switch theory. \u201cPart of the scientific testing method is that we need to be open to multiple possibilities, including that one\u2019s own position may be wrong,\u201d Young says. \u201cYet he self-declares his position to be 99.9% certain.\u201d Zak counters that he has fully analysed the opposite scenario \u2013 that Jeanne was Jeanne \u2013 in follow-up work this year, and rejects accusations of fraud.\nAs well as the lack of academic rigour in the original paper, Young believes its disproportionately high number of reads (70,000, when the revised version only got 1,400) might have been inflated by bots, or human intervention. Zak also manipulated a photograph of a young Yvonne Calment to emphasise what he believed (others dispute it is visible at all) to be a growth on her nose later possessed by her mother. Young alleges that such sleights of hand indicate that Zak, or people working with him, had an ulterior agenda.\nStill, the switch camp had arguments that couldn\u2019t easily be dismissed. There was Calment\u2019s odd request, when Arles\u2019s archives asked for them, that her personal papers be burned; and a 2006 account in a French industry newspaper of a dinner at which a guest intimated that Calment\u2019s insurers had known of the identity switch, but no action had been taken because she was already too famous. In mid-September, Inserm released an official rebuttal paper, co-authored by Robine, Allard and two others. While it didn\u2019t address every aspect of the Russian case, it was a cool riposte, summarising many of the counter-investigation\u2019s discoveries, and calling for the formal retraction of Zak\u2019s paper.\nZak upped the ante. In an open letter sent to prominent gerontologists, longevity researchers and journalists \u2013 with Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and the White House CCed \u2013 he called again for the testing of Calment\u2019s DNA. \u201cI don\u2019t think such a study would be harmful to anybody,\u201d he argued, \u201cwhile the potential benefits for science are huge.\u201d Many people thought Zak had gone too far. One member of the board of Rejuvenation Research, which had published his revised paper, resigned, saying it had \u201cdisgraced the field of gerontology in both Russia and internationally\u201d.\nBack in Arles, the counter-investigation group were also wondering about the peculiar behaviour of their \u201cRussian friend\u201d. He had been helpful at first, but in the depths of long comment threads he could often be provocative, even goading. One member succeeded in getting Zak temporarily blocked from the forum on 5 March for a slanging match that culminated in the Russian calling him a \u201ccrook\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very unpredictable,\u201d says C\u00e9cile Pellegrini. \u201cSometimes he has a sense of humour, other times he\u2019s odious, and we\u2019re forced to block him for a few days.\u201d They speculate that more than one person might be using his account, and that Zak or the Zaks might be paid trolls. (Zak denies receiving any payment or support from others.) But if Zak is a frontman, who might he be fronting for?\nThe theory that the Calment attack has been politically directed is dismissed by Novoselov, the gerontologist who tasked Zak with investigating her. \u201cLook, no one in Russia cares at all about this story,\u201d he says. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t care less. There have been two articles in the media, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Novoselov says he is simply following his scientific instincts, and compares the French attachment to Calment to the national cult of Joan of Arc. \u201cTheir ability to believe in such fairytales is one of the fundamental reasons behind the creation of this [longevity] record.\u201d\nThe straight-talking 57-year-old is speaking in the canteen at the Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology in Moscow, where he has just given a lecture on Calment. Having previously argued that Lenin died of syphilis rather than a stroke, Novoselov is used to courting controversy. In January, he declared that his goal was to get Calment struck off the supercentenarians register. Wasn\u2019t it cavalier to do so before there was conclusive evidence? \u201cWhat\u2019s conclusive evidence if there is no material from the patient?\u201d he counters. \u201cIf they showed us her medical records, then maybe we would be convinced.\u201d\nNovoselov wrote to Young about Calment in October 2018, \u201casking him to look attentively at the issues we raised\u201d. The American took it, says Novoselov, as \u201ca display of aggression by Russia against everything civilised\u201d; after a cordial initial response by email, Young later characterised his work as a conspiracy directed from on high by \u201csomeone important\u201d. But it\u2019s not surprising that Novoselov\u2019s abrasive tactics have raised eyebrows; he has threatened Young, as well as Calment\u2019s validators, with investigation by Sledkom, the Russian FBI.\nThe evidence for a Russian disinformation campaign is thin, but Zak\u2019s paper did have a second sponsor. The peer-reviewed version was published in Rejuvenation Research, the journal devoted to life-extension research edited by Aubrey de Grey, the controversial gerontologist and life-extension advocate who has claimed that, by 2100, the human lifespan could reach 5,000 years. Even if Zak doesn\u2019t believe it, the possibility that Calment did reach 122 is tantalising for De Grey. \u201cAnyone who is the world record holder of longevity is of interest to those of us studying the biology of ageing,\u201d he tells me.\nSpeaking on the phone from London, where he is on a stopover between Berlin and his home in California, De Grey is evasive about whether his strategy is to force the release of Calment\u2019s blood sample. But he does think it should be made available for science: \u201cIn the interests of saving lives, finding out more about ageing to eventually postpone ageing \u2013 then that\u2019s actually quite important.\u201d Would he want his own research foundation, Sens, to do the DNA testing? Not necessarily, he says, \u201cbut I would certainly know the right kind of researchers to recommend\u201d.\nThat analysis seems unlikely to happen any time soon. The Fondation Jean Dausset, a private genetic research centre in Paris, refuses even to confirm that it is keeping Jeanne Calment\u2019s blood; just that it has a collection of biosamples it alone can use for research under anonymised conditions. But Fran\u00e7ois Sch\u00e4chter, the scientist who in the 1990s founded its Chronos Project, the first genetic survey of centenarians in the world, has confirmed that her blood was taken and her DNA extracted.\nTwenty years ago, the life-extension field promoted by mavericks like De Grey was outlaw science. Now, the landscape has changed: the technical means for \u201chacking\u201d the human lifespan have come into being, and the sector is beginning to attract serious investment. In 2013, Google invested $1.5bn in an entire division, Calico, devoted to \u201csolving death\u201d. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to Sens.\nBut Sens, according to its annual reports, has been running at heavy losses. De Grey says it has been spending the $13m he put into the foundation in 2011 on research for anti-ageing therapies that will save \u201cseveral million\u201d lives. But it must start to pay its way; wouldn\u2019t securing the DNA of the oldest woman in the world be a great publicity coup, as death-dodging tech billionaires pile into the sector? De Grey bats off this idea. \u201cI get enough media attention as it is.\u201d\nIf he could study Calment\u2019s DNA, what might he expect to learn? De Grey points out that supercentenarians\u2019 genetic material contains a high ratio of useful information, \u201cbecause they have to get more things right in order to get to the age they do\u201d. One obvious area of interest is how Calment bypassed cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other late-life killers.\nSeveral scientists I spoke to believe that Calment\u2019s genome should be made available for study; but they don\u2019t approve of the way Zak and De Grey have seemingly attempted to force the foundation\u2019s hand. One consequence of promoting the switch theory, they point out, is that they have alienated family members whose own DNA might be crucial in understanding Calment\u2019s.\nEarlier this month, a Russian news agency announced that a woman who was purportedly 123 had died in the Astrakhan region of southern Russia. This is almost certainly impossible \u2013 even Novoselov thinks so; given her children\u2019s ages, she would have given birth three times in her 50s. But the story underlines the need for gerontology to keep its house in order.\nAt the time of going to press, scientists from around the world were due to discuss the impact of the Calment affair on gerontology at a special meeting in Paris. As for her mortal remains, some think the Fondation Jean Dausset might be more open to collaboration as anti-ageing science evolves \u2013 but it is unlikely to be with De Grey. Despite telling me that Jeanne Calment does not figure high on his priorities, he plans to devote another issue of Rejuvenation Research to age validation and Calment next year.\nIn Arles, despite everything, the counter-investigation group are tickled by the idea that Jeanne Calment might have been a master fraudster. \u201cI would really like the switch story to be true, like in the novels I love reading,\u201d says C\u00e9cile Pellegrini. \u201cI find that kind of thing super-exciting. If it\u2019s actually true, she was really something!\u201d But perhaps the doyenne has something else to teach the would-be immortals of Silicon Valley: what extra trouble would 5,000 years of existence bring, if we can\u2019t get the record straight on a single ordinary lifetime?\n Additional reporting by Marc Bennetts\n This article was amended on 2 December 2019 to correct the spelling of C\u00e9cile Pellegrini\u2019s surname in a photo caption; on 3 December to clarify the interactions between Novoselov and Young; and on 10 December to further clarify Novoselov and Young\u2019s exchange and the circumstances of Nikolay Zak\u2019s photo-editing.\n If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

        "content": "French hunters claim tradition justifies their exemption from EU rules. But with many species endangered, there is growing pressure for a ban\nIt is early morning in the heart of Provence, and somewhere behind the tall black pine trees a rousing dawn chorus begins. We are crouching out of sight among the rosemary bushes and wild asparagus listening to the melodic musical phrases of song thrushes and blackbirds.\nThis is Marcel Pagnol country, rich in flora and fauna and of exceptional natural beauty; but there is no sign of the singing birds anywhere in the rustling foliage, trees or sky.\nYves Verilhac, of France\u2019s Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux (LPO), knows why. \u201cThe singing you can hear is from caged thrushes and blackbirds who are appellants (callers). They\u2019re caught and kept in the dark for months so when they\u2019re taken out into daylight they sing their hearts out and attract other birds.\u201d\nHe points above the treetops where clusters of sticks attached to vertical poles glisten in the nascent sunlight. \u201cThose are verguettes: sticks covered in glue. The callers call, other birds come, land on a verguette, and they\u2019re stuck. The more they struggle to get away, the more they become stuck.\u201d\nThe trilling Proven\u00e7al songbirds are unwitting decoys to lure more birds into a death trap, he says. Once enticed, the birds are either blasted out of the sky by hunters hidden in camouflaged cabins, or find themselves stuck on the sticks.\nIt is a scene with which readers of Roald Dahl\u2019s The Twits \u2013 in which the Twits coat branches with glue to catch birds to bake in a pie \u2013 will be familiar.\nLa chasse \u00e0 la glu \u2013 glue-trapping \u2013 was banned in the EU by a 1979 bird directive, except in special circumstances where it is \u201ccontrolled, selective and in limited quantities\u201d. Since 1989, France has invoked these circumstances to permit glue-trapping in five south-east departments on the grounds that it is \u201ctraditional\u201d.\nBird campaigners, who say the practice is unspeakably cruel, have secretly shot photographs and film that they say proves it is not selective and, worse, poses a threat to endangered species. They have brought numerous legal cases in national and European courts over the past 30 years. All have failed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve concrete evidence that sometimes the bird is struggling for 20\u201330 minutes. To remove them from the sticks, they spray them with petrol or acetone, which is toxic, and if it\u2019s not a species they\u2019re allowed to trap they often throw the bird away like a stone,\u201d Verilhac says.\nHe stabs at his mobile phone to bring up a photograph of a dead robin, with its unmistakable red breast, stuck by its wing, legs and beak to a glue stick. \u201cThis is what they call \u2018tradition\u2019, but it\u2019s a practice from the middle ages and barbaric,\u201d he says.\nThe LPO claims French hunters kill an estimated 17 million birds every year \u2013 more than any other country \u2013 from 64 species. Of these birds, many of which are migratory, 20 are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of endangered species in Europe, including the turtle dove, rock ptarmigan, redwing and curlew. About 1.4m song thrushes and more than 2m partridges are killed annually. Glue-trappers have permission to catch 42,500 song thrushes and blackbirds this year, half last year\u2019s quota. Last year the French president, Emmanuel Macron, gave in to pressure from the powerful hunting lobby and halved the cost of a hunting licence.\nThe hunters claim glue-trapping dates back at least several family generations, and reject accusations of cruelty. They insist they are quick to remove any stuck birds and release those they are not permitted to trap \u2013 such as robins, blue tits and warblers \u2013 back into the wild. This is the official quid pro quo for being allowed to hunt with glue.\nThere are an estimated 6,000 licensed glue-trappers of songbirds in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d\u2019Azur region who are allowed to hunt between 1 October and 15 December, from one hour before sunrise to 11am every day. They must log and officially report their catches and kills, and birds shot must be for personal consumption. Those caught on glue sticks must be immediately unstuck and either caged or released.\nEric Camoin, president of the Association de D\u00e9fense des Chasses Traditionnelles \u00e0 la Grive (Association for the Defence of Traditional Thrush Hunting), accuses the LPO of \u201cfaking\u201d photos and says those filmed breaking the rules are a minority.\n\u201cBirds caught using glue are never killed. If they are one of the five species (four thrush and one blackbird) we are allowed to catch, they are kept as callers. If not, they are released alive and freed,\u201d Camoin says.\n\u201cAs with any activity there are always those who do illegal things and they should be punished. I am clear about that. It doesn\u2019t mean the whole activity should be banned. You don\u2019t outlaw driving just because some people speed at 200kph,\u201d he said.\nThere are just 50 \u201cnature police\u201d from France\u2019s National Hunting and Wildlife Agency (ONCFS) working across the five departments covering an area of 31,400 sq km, and they have other tasks aside from getting up before the crack of dawn to check on songbird trappers, says Verilhac.\n\u201cThe hunters are supposed to keep a log of how many birds they have caught and present it to the authorities at the end of the season. What sort of control is that?\u201d he adds. \u201cHow do we know they release the callers at the end of the season? How do we know they are not selling them?\u201d\nAt 11am, the bird trappers behind the pine trees are packing up to go home, closing up their camouflaged hides, some fitted out with rugs and heaters. A hunter holding two dead song thrushes quickly hides them behind his back as we approach. He is reluctant to show us either them or the caller birds that he has in cages in the back of a battered car. He says he shot the birds in his hand and that they will \u201cgo in the freezer for Christmas\u201d. Thrush brochette is a regional speciality, though hunting the birds is often just for sport.\nSurely there is not much meat on them, we ask. \u201cWe eat the whole thing. Delicious,\u201d he says.\nAnother hunter, in a clearing filled with poles and perches for glue-sticks, warns us we should go back to the main path as there is an animal shoot in progress. He says he has caught no birds today. Inspecting his patch after he has gone, we find freshly removed feathers among the leaves on the ground. It is the same at all the clearings we visit, throwing doubt on Camoin\u2019s insistence that glue-trapped birds are not killed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massacre,\u201d says Verilhac, picking up a gluey clump of feathers.\n\u201cThese are from a warbler and they\u2019re definitely not allowed to trap them. They claim they release the birds alive but if they\u2019ve lost these tail feathers they can\u2019t fly and will starve.\n\u201cEven if they let them go, the birds are so traumatised or injured by the petrol or acetone used to remove them from the glue-sticks they\u2019re as good as dead.\u201d\nLater, Verilhac shows us a collection of gruesome photographs and videos secretly taken of glue-trappers in the Proven\u00e7al hills in the past six weeks.\nThey show robins, blue tits, warblers and finches struggling and dying on glue-sticks or being pulled off and discarded like litter. Last year, LPO activists found a dead kestrel, its wings gummed with glue.\nCamoin, who has been hunting birds since he was a boy, when he went with his grandfather, is sceptical. He calls the photographs montages. \u201cIf these pictures are real \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying they are \u2013 then the culprits must be punished. I\u2019m passionate about birds and of course it pains me to see them suffer,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI say to people: \u2018You don\u2019t like hunting, that\u2019s fine. I respect your view, but leave me alone. I probably don\u2019t like some things you do but that\u2019s your decision, your life,\u2019\u201d Camoin adds.\nVerilhac\u2019s response is resolved and clinical. The LPO will keep fighting what it considers an anachronistic barbarity, he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s patently clear the birds suffer, but suffering and cruelty are not enough for the EU to force France to ban glue-trapping. I have to argue on the grounds that France is breaking EU conditions for allowing it, that we have absolute proof that it is not controlled and it is not selective,\u201d he says.\nThe 1979 bird directive is the oldest EU legislation concerning the environment and aims to protect the zone\u2019s 500 native species, an estimated 32% of which are reportedly in decline.\nThe directive permits the \u201chunting of wild birds for recreational purposes\u201d but only if it is carried out \u201cunder strictly supervised conditions and on a selective basis\u201d, only \u201ccertain birds in small numbers\u201d are caught, and there is \u201cno other satisfactory method of trapping the birds\u201d.\nBird protection organisations including the LPO and France Nature Environnement are campaigning for a total ban on glue-trapping. France is currently under investigation by the European commission for three separate types of bird hunting \u2013 including la chasse \u00e0 la glu \u2013 alleged to contravene the directive.\nBirdlife International says almost a fifth of European birds are at risk of extinction.\n\u201cFrance likes to present itself as a world leader in matters of biodiversity and give lessons to others,\u201d says Verilhac. \u201cLa chasse \u00e0 la glu is one of our famous French exceptions. And not one of which we are proud.\u201d\n This article was amended on 18 March 2021. The redwing was incorrectly called a violet thrush in an earlier version due to a translation error.",

The Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, Helen Pidd, will be among the journalists reviewing Sunday\u2019s newspapers.\nLabour candidates accused the BBC of \u201cabject surrender\u201d in allowing Johnson to be interviewed by Marr without agreeing to the Neil interview.\nBen Bradshaw, a Labour former culture secretary and candidate in Exeter, tweeted: \u201cThis is a shameful and abject surrender by the BBC management, which will leave professional BBC journalists absolutely horrified and in despair with an organisation where morale is already at rock bottom.\u201d\nIn a tweet, the Ilford North candidate Wes Streeting said: \u201cI love the BBC and hate the regular attacks on its impartiality and the professionalism of its journalists, particularly when it has some of the very best in the business. But this decision is wrong. The BBC have been played by the Tory leader and shouldn\u2019t dance to his tune.\u201d\nLabour had accused Johnson of avoiding Neil, insisting it had agreed to let Jeremy Corbyn appear on the programme in the belief that the prime minister was already signed up.\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe reason [Johnson] is doing this is because he thinks, like his Bullingdon friends, that they are above the rest of us, that they don\u2019t need to be held to account, they don\u2019t need to be treated like the rest of us.\u201d\nThe prime minister also refused to appear on Channel 4 News\u2019s climate change debate on Thursday, where he was replaced with a melting ice sculpture.\nIn response, the Conservatives complained to the media regulator, Ofcom, about alleged bias; threatened to change the public service remit of Channel 4 if they won the election; and sent their own camera crew to follow Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as he attempted to take Johnson\u2019s place on the debate.\nITV will hold its election debate on Sunday evening, featuring the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National party\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon, Si\u00e2n Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, and Plaid Cymru\u2019s Adam Price.\nParty representatives for Labour and the Conservatives were still to be confirmed, the broadcaster said.\nDuring the debate, from 7pm-9pm, each representative will have one minute for their opening statement and 45sec for a closing statement.",

        "content": "Usman Khan had realised in prison that Islamist violence was wrong, says Vajahat Sharif\nThe London Bridge attacker had asked for help to be deradicalised while he was in prison, but none was forthcoming, his solicitor has claimed.\nVajahat Sharif told the Guardian Usman Khan had come to realise that violent extremism was wrong and accepted his understanding of Islam was deficient.\nKhan was one of nine members of an al-Qaida-inspired terrorist group convicted in 2012 of plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange and build a terrorist training camp in Pakistan that was disrupted by MI5 and the police. He was also a supporter of al-Muhijaroun, the extremist group with which scores of terrorists were involved. However, Sharif said Khan became disillusioned with the group after his imprisonment, and that extremists may have targeted him to be \u201cre-groomed\u201d after release from jail, with devastating consequences.\nHe said Khan first mentioned wanting to be free of Islamist extremism after his conviction in 2012, and then repeatedly throughout his time in jail, last mentioning it in 2018 before his release.\n\u201cHe requested intervention by a deradicaliser when he was in prison,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThe only option was the probation service and they cannot deal with these offenders. He asked me on the phone to get assistance from a specific deradicaliser.\n\u201cHe asked [me] once or twice before he was released in 2018. Probation do a good job with conventional offenders but they can\u2019t deal with ideological offenders.\u201d\n Khan, 28, killed two people and injured three others before being shot dead by police during a stabbing rampage at London Bridge on Friday afternoon. After his conviction in 2012 he was given an indeterminate jail sentence, with a minimum term of eight years. On appeal in 2013, it was replaced with a 16-year, fixed-term sentence and an extended period on licence.\nSharif said Khan, whom he last spoke to in March, was released to a bail hostel from where he had to report to a police station every day, had interactions with the probation service and had to wear a tag.\n\u201cIn prison he begin to realise his Islamic thinking was not correct; he accepted that. He criticised the al-Qaida ideology and violent extremism. He did recognise that his Islamic understanding was incomplete. A lot of these characters pick and choose from different sermons, it\u2019s like an echo chamber.\u201d\n Sharif said the policy for terrorist prisoners needed to change to boost efforts to turn them away from supporting ideologies that incite violence: \u201cThere is a flaw in the policy. You should have substantial ideological evaluation of these individuals before they are released on licence.\u201d\nSharif said Khan appeared to be rehabilitated and was a model prisoner during his time in HMP Whitemoor: \u201cHe was having a go at Isis before his release. I\u2019ve no idea what happened after his release, that is what is shocking. Maybe he was not ideologically robust enough to resist the radicalising groomers \u2013 I thought he was a reformed character.\u201d\nHe said that when Khan was arrested in 2010 he supported al-Muhijaroun, but \u201cby the end he was disillusioned with them\u201d.\n\u201cHis parents are thoroughly decent, hard-working people, first-generation migrants from Pakistan. His family were at a loss when he was arrested and charged.\u201d",

        "content": "The Guardian looks at the terms of attacker\u2019s release and 2012 sentence\nKhan was convicted in 2012 of being part of a group of al-Qaida-inspired plotters who intended to carry out attacks in the UK \u2013 including on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 and set up a terrorist camp in Pakistan.\nKhan was released from prison on licence last year and at the time of the attack he was wearing an electronic tag and subject to low-level monitoring. While he was known to the security services, he was considered a low- to medium-priority threat.\nKhan was jailed after receiving a controversial sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) in 2012. This allowed him to be held in prison indefinitely, with no minimum term, until a parole board agreed he was no longer a threat to the public.\nIPPs were introduced under Labour, but abolished by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in December 2012 (although, importantly, not retrospectively), amid complaints they had been misused to keep some individuals incarcerated without a proper timetable to be considered for release. IPPs were replaced by extended sentences, which carry a minimum term or tariff to ensure that cases would be reviewed.\nAgainst that backdrop, Khan and two others successfully appealed against their IPP sentences. In 2013, the court of appeal revised Khan\u2019s sentence to a term of 16 years, and told him he would have to spend a minimum of eight years behind bars.\nThis is where it appears something went wrong. At the time, Lord Justice Leveson at the court of appeal indicated that he expected the Parole Board to review Khan\u2019s case at the end of the eight-year minimum term, describing anybody who had committed such terrorism offences as dangerous.\n\u201cThere is an argument for concluding that anyone convicted of such an offence should be incentivised to demonstrate that he can safely be released; such a decision is then better left to the Parole Board for consideration proximate in time to the date when release becomes possible,\u201d Leveson said.\nBut on Saturday morning, the Parole Board put out a statement saying it had not reviewed Khan\u2019s case at all \u2013 and that the London Bridge terrorist had been released without its involvement \u2013 suggesting the law had been misunderstood or misapplied.\nIt said: \u201cThe Parole Board can confirm it had no involvement with the release of the individual identified as the attacker, who appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law), without ever being referred to the Board.\u201d\nAn analysis conducted by the Guardian a little over a year ago showed that a growing number of people previously convicted for terror offences are eligible for release. These are typically sentences handed down to people found guilty of attack planning or funding terrorism \u2013 rather than those found guilty of violent acts.\nThe figures showed that more than 80 of the 193 terms issued for these types terror offences between 2007 and 2016 ran out by the end of 2018. The figures exclude those with life or indeterminate sentences, but as in Khan\u2019s case, many will have shown a strong intention to attack at the time.\nSuch individuals will rarely be placed under active scrutiny by intelligence agencies, leaving them largely in the day-to-day monitoring of the probation service.",

        "content": "Members of the public, including a convicted murderer, bring terrorist to the ground\nA convicted murderer was among ex-prisoners and members of the public who grappled with and grounded the London Bridge knife attacker before police arrived.\nOne man was armed with a fire extinguisher and another a 5ft narwhal tusk as people at the scene surrounded the attacker, who was eventually pinned to the ground.\nScotland Yard is investigating how 28-year-old Usman Khan was able to launch the attack in London Bridge, despite being known to the authorities and fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements. He was allowed out a year ago after serving time for his part in a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange.\nIn footage that has since emerged, Khan is sprayed with a fire extinguisher, while another man tries to suppress the assailant with a narwhal tusk \u2013 a long pointed tooth from a type of whale \u2013 lunging at him. It is believed the item was pulled from the wall of Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, a Grade II-listed building on London Bridge, by a Polish chef called \u0141ukasz.\nAmong those who pinned down the attacker was James Ford, 42, who is also thought to have tried to save the life of a woman who had been stabbed. Ford was jailed for life in 2004 for the murder of 21-year-old Amanda Champion.\nFord, who is understood to be serving the final days of his sentence at HMP Standford Hill, an open prison in Kent, was on London Bridge as the attack unfolded.\nDavid Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham City University and chair of the Friends of Grendon prison \u2013 where Ford was previously \u2013 said the prisoner went through an intensive period of psychotherapy.\n\u201cI only picked up it was James Ford as a consequence of them publishing his photo \u2026 I remember him and indeed some others from the Friends of Grendon charity.\u201d\nHe said what happened was a tale of two prisoners, with Ford an example of how people can change. \u201cI know through my work that people do change and they change as a consequence of innovative but challenging regimes such as the one at HMP Grendon.\u201d\nKhan was at at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall near London Bridge for a University of Cambridge-organised conference on rehabilitating offenders, after previously participating in the university\u2019s Learning Together prisoner rehabilitation programme, but had showed \u201cno cause for concern\u201d, a source told PA Media.\nWilson said of Khan: \u201cThere was a so-called deradicalisation programme and I wonder if Khan went through that \u2026 If he went through the deradicalisation programme then it is on another level a tale of two programmes, that programme clearly did not deredicalise him.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIn the US there is a phenomenon \u2018suicide by cop\u2019... increasingly what we are seeing is some attackers wear pretend suicide vests as they prefer martyrdom than getting a sentence. I wonder if what we are seeing is another version of suicide by cop.\u201d\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, praised the police and the public for their actions, sharing footage on social media of the people trying to bring the suspect down.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about the images we\u2019ve seen is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran towards danger, not knowing what confronted them,\u201d he said.\nIn a tweet, Amy Coop, said: \u201cA guy who was with us at Fishmongers Hall took a 5ft narwhal tusk from the wall and went out to confront the attacker. You can see him standing over the man (with what looks like a white pole) in the video. We were trying to help victims inside but that man\u2019s a hero.\u201d\nCraig Heathcote was walking across the bridge as happened. \u201cI was on the east side of the bridge, walking across it \u2013 heading to the supermarket on my lunch break. A man appeared in front of me and started screaming that there was someone with a knife, then I realised something was happening,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\nHe said it took a while to process what was going on, but he could see what looked like a \u201cbig scuffle happening\u201d and what felt like \u201chundreds of people screaming\u201d on the bridge.\n\u201cThe police were not yet there so I called 999 as I felt no one else was [calling them] \u2026 While I was on the phone I think a car appeared. It was either the first response or by chance a car driving across the bridge. Someone jumped out and waved them down. Two armed officers jumped out and took over situation,\u201d he said.\nHeathcote said he saw and heard the gunshots as the suspect was shot by police. \u201cIt was quite a bizarre moment watching it all unfold,\u201d he said.\nThomas Gray, 24, was among the group who tackled the killer to the ground. He stamped on the terrorist\u2019s wrist to try to make him release one of two large knives he was carrying.\nGray, a tour manager, said: \u201cI was brought up on rugby and the rule is \u2018one in, all in\u2019. I did what any Londoner would do and tried to put a stop to it.\u201d\nHe had been driving northbound on London Bridge with his colleague Stevie when they saw people running. He said they turned the engine off and when they reached the attacker he had been \u201cwrestled\u201d to the floor by \u201cfive or six other blokes\u201d.\n\u201cHe had two knives on him, one in each hand, and it looked like they were taped to his hands,\u201d Gray said.\n\u201cI stamped on his left wrist while someone else smacked his hand on the ground and kicked one of the knives away.\nThe former Metropolitan police Ch Supt Dal Babu said: \u201cThe terrorist attack on London Bridge demonstrated the worst and best in society. This cowardly individual sought to kill indiscriminately, but brave Londoners alongside the police prevented further deaths because of their swift actions. They are truly heroes.\u201d",

        "content": "Royal Academy, LondonThere is little urgency and plenty of chin-stroking from the artists and architects in a show that claims to confront the climate emergency but offers few answers\nThere are appropriate responses to climate emergency: anger, seriousness, the determination to do something about it. Also, the recognition of the scale and complexity of the challenges it presents, of the dangers of unintended consequences, of the shortage of easy answers. You could imagine the material for powerful displays on the theme: the streets of Matera in southern Italy turned into whitewater rapids, Piazza San Marco as a lake, incinerated koalas, any amount of terrifying imagery of storm, drought, rising ocean and scorching Earth. Or a piece as impactful as the melting iceberg that Olafur Eliasson brought to the side of the Thames, in his Ice Watch London.\nI\u2019m not convinced that the responses and images offered by the Royal Academy in its Eco-Visionaries exhibition, which claims to be \u201cconfronting a planet in a state of emergency\u201d, rise to the occasion. Here, a number of artists and architects present installations and exhibits that react somehow or other to the question of climate, which is fine, but the overall tone is speculative and oblique. In a situation that requires the rolling up of sleeves, Eco-Visionaries offers the stroking of chins, fingers placed against temples, the furrowing of brows, the escape of a slow hmmm from pursed lips. That dread term \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d, so often used to dismiss integrity and commitment, is apposite here.\nThus, we have A Film, Reclaimed, a 2015 piece by Ana Vaz and Tristan Bera, in which clips from movies \u2013 for example, a steamship hauled through the jungle in Fitzcarraldo, a scene of whale slaughter, the face of Frankenstein\u2019s monster \u2013 are mixed into a cocktail of unsettling imagery. Statements, in French and English, are spoken and written on the screen. Among them is a call for \u201ca return to the true polis: polysemy\u201d.\nI mean, I\u2019m all for polysemy. I love polysemy. I even have some idea what the word means. But the exhibition\u2019s concern with niche concepts doesn\u2019t sit well with the urgency of its subject. Vaz and Bera, to be fair, can be more punchy \u2013 \u201cOur economic system is a war against nature\u201d, for example. Such words, though, presented with only the artful fiction of the film clips as supporting evidence, can end up sounding glib and sententious.\nElsewhere, you can see the invisible pollutants in Madrid rendered as coloured clouds. There is The Breast Milk of the Volcano, a work by Unknown Fields about the astonishing Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, a vast white salt flat that is part of the lithium triangle, the area containing more than half the world\u2019s known supply of an element extremely useful in long-lasting and high-performing batteries. The film draws attention to the mythic importance of the area to its indigenous people. It points out the environmental cost of clean-seeming electrical energy.\nOne of the more effective pieces is the final one in the exhibition, Rimini Protokoll\u2019s 2017 installation win > < win. Here, you sit in a small auditorium, wearing headphones, watching a reflective screen that you slowly discover to be a jellyfish tank, beyond which you slowly discover other people, in an identical auditorium, having the same experience as your own, but on a different cycle of time.\nYou\u2019re encouraged to reflect on the fact that jellyfish have existed for hundreds of millions of years and could continue for hundreds more, especially as they are currently benefiting from global warming. Homo sapiens, whose survival is so much more demanding of resources, would be lucky to last a fraction of that time. It is another work that, while clever and engaging, is more likely to provoke mild reflection than a call to arms.\nBoth exhibits and captions resort to what might be called the Radio 4 \u201cwe\u201d. (Or, to be honest, the Observer or the Guardian \u201cwe\u201d: we \u2013 ha! \u2013 are all at it.) In this formulation, the pronoun shuttles between describing the whole of humanity (\u201cwe are facing an ecological emergency\u201d) and the beneficiaries of a developed economy who might get to see or contribute to an exhibition such as this, as in \u201cour economic system\u201d. This \u201cwe\u201d arrogates self-importance to those who use it.\nIt also blurs the difference between what climate crisis means to different people in different parts of the world, the conflicting facts that poorer regions suffer most, and that the slowing of growth thought necessary to avert disaster is likely to hit them hardest. It is this kind of tough problem that gets overlooked by some of the airy statements in the Eco-Visionaries exhibition.\nIt is not that the perception of emergency should blow away all nuance or makes all other aspects of human life and culture redundant (otherwise, how would most of us justify our existence?). But there is a dissonance between the Academy\u2019s claim to be \u201cconfronting\u201d the issue and the curator-speak it also uses \u2013 for example about \u201cinnovative approaches that reframe our relationship with nature\u201d. This is not so much rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic as interrogating the weave of their fabric and reframing their frames.\nThe strongest pieces in Eco-Visionaries bring about a shift in your soul: Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg\u2019s The Substitute is a heart-rending animation of the almost extinct northern white rhino, roaming in the confines of an abstract white box, disappearing into and reappearing from a pixelated version of itself. I\u2019m grateful, too, to Unknown Fields, for the insight they provide into the lithium triangle.\nHowever, some of the work on show risks becoming the contemporary equivalent of moralistic and religiose art of the past, of depictions of extravagantly wailing Madonnas or of caricatures of virtue and vice. Into this category comes HeHe\u2019s Domestic Catastrophe No. 3: La Plan\u00e8te Laboratoire, which greets you on entry. Here, a globe, suspended in an aquarium, becomes enveloped in dye. Which, in a way that seems a touch trite, represents pollution.\nThe exhibition includes Dolphin Embassy, a proposal by the architecture and design collective Ant Farm for a solar-powered floating structure that would further social relations between species. It is as appealing and gently provocative as anything in the show, but it was conceived in 1974 and never put into practice. Should it not be possible, 45 years on, to do more than nudge awareness and promote whimsical hypothesis?\n Eco-Visionaries is at the Royal Academy, London, until 23 February 2020",

        "content": "Natural History Museum, LondonChris Martin and co ditch unsustainable tours in favour of an intimate showcase of new album Everyday Life complete with gospel singers, global guests and the odd blue whale\n\u201cYesterday morning we were in Jordan,\u201d marvels Chris Martin, hastily strapping on an acoustic guitar. As a statue of Charles Darwin frowns down from the top of the Natural History Museum entrance hall steps, microphone stands are rearranged around Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland. Cameramen dart about.\nMartin usually performs in a tearing hurry. His air of flustered bonhomie lends Coldplay\u2019s stadium shows an air of cultural urgency they might otherwise lack. His manner is more understandable tonight. Coldplay have arrived later than the advertised 10pm. There is a lot to get through \u2013 great swaths of a new double album, special guests, a hit or three, and corny jokes about the museum.\n\u201cI said, \u2018When we launch our album, can we do a gig near Wales\u2019,\u201d Martin offers, as the skeleton of a blue whale looms above. The realisation dawns on the parents of young children here that the reason that Dippy the Diplodocus was evicted from this hall wasn\u2019t because he wanted to go on tour, but because he was in the way. Now they have more floor space for events such as this.\nTonight\u2019s gig, in aid of the environmental charity Client Earth, has required a hectic turnaround. The band\u2019s latest album, Everyday Life, was launched at the weekend with a performance at the citadel in Amman, Jordan, broadcast on YouTube. Two sets were separated by a seriously long drinks interval. Sunrise found the band performing half the record as the dawn broke over a city chosen for being \u201cbang in the middle of the Middle East\u201d, a region where relatively few western rock bands venture.\nSunset, meanwhile, offered up the other half, fading light and a few dozen excitable young Ammanites on backing vocals, in lieu of an audience. Both films featured atmospheric drone-cam shots of Amman, in which women pegged out clothing on rooftops and cars snaked past in the city below: everyday life, but perhaps exotic window dressing too. Due to environmental concerns, this is as live as Everyday Life will get. Coldplay won\u2019t be touring until tours are more sustainable.\nIf that announcement prompted dismay internationally \u2013 with their \u201coh, woah-oh\u201d choruses, Coldplay export very well \u2013 the band don\u2019t exactly have a citadel to climb to please tonight\u2019s hometown crowd. Most bands are far more rewarding up close \u2013 tonight is very intimate, by Coldplay standards. And gigs in museums beat those in soulless hangars, even with the band\u2019s trademark light-up wristbands.\nColdplay\u2019s job is made easier, too, by the fact that Everyday Life is one of the more eventful and intriguing albums in their catalogue. One song, Guns, calls for gun control in the US, quite a rarity for a band who usually use non-specific emotional watercolours, even on Politik, their 2002 song about 9/11. Another new album track \u2013 Trouble in Town \u2013 features grim audio of US police harassment (although that clip isn\u2019t played tonight).\nOne track has a title given only in Arabic; it features a passage in Igbo and a blessing from spiritual jazz greats John and Alice Coltrane. The start of \u00c8k\u00f3 recalls west African kora music. Coldplay even go doo-wop.\nAll this does sound try-hard written down, a little \u201cwoke\u201d after the fact. Not far away in west London, Damon Albarn \u2013 of Blur, Gorillaz and Africa Express \u2013 is probably rolling his eyes at Coldplay\u2019s exciting new dalliance with world music. Somewhere in an Irish keep, Bono is tenting his fingers and chortling at how precisely Coldplay are following U2\u2019s grand gestures yet again.\nBut these new songs are often persuasive. Played out in this Victorian cathedral to science, this latest iteration of Coldplay \u2013 rootsy, open-bordered, a little sweary \u2013 gels.\nNaturally, some of the new songs, such as Church, remain resolutely true to type. Although Martin opened up about his past religiosity and his current attitudes in a recent interview \u2013 God is love, roughly \u2013 Church isn\u2019t actually about religion. It finds Martin extolling romantic love as succour.\nAs for God, free badges are available, with \u201clove\u201d written on them, and four gospel singers add their voices to Broken, an out-and-out gospel tune. It\u2019s worth seeking out the band\u2019s jokey album press conference video, in which Coldplay get all the barbs against themselves in first. \u201cI was wondering if you were familiar with the old quote, \u2018when the songs are dire, call the gospel choir\u2019,\u201d snarks Carrie Brownstein, asking questions alongside Fred Armisen.\nThe backing vocalists come on and off again several times tonight \u2013 once, for a particularly mellifluous version of Fix You, the most enduring of their lovelorn ballads, where Martin hands the last part of the song over to their sweet tones.\nLike the album, the gig is busy with moving parts. A string section comes and goes. Dressed in a billowing white gown, guest vocalist Norah Shaqur adds an Arabic part to Broken and to the closing title track. These international guests and their cross-genre malleability actually suit Coldplay, the erstwhile fair trade campaigners, far more than the usual vapid cross-branding exercises they undertake.\nMost genuinely moving tonight is a track called Arabesque, a song that seems slightly misnamed, as it recalls the desert rock of Tinariwen more than anything north African. The gig becomes fluid and supercharged with rhythm when Femi Kuti, son of Fela, and the horn section from his Positive Force band arrive \u2013 and then remain on stage for one of their own tracks.\nOrphans, by contrast, tells a story set to the backdrop of the Syrian refugee crisis. The ringing chorus \u2013 \u201cI want to know when I can go home and get drunk with my friends\u201d \u2013 aims to drive home the point that refugees are just like the rest of us. It slightly misses the point about how Islamic youngsters might choose to party. But as a dose of stadium uplift in miniature, it works just fine.",

Her lawyers said she had been abused and subjected to decades of coercive control throughout her marriage, factors that they said had not been considered adequately at her original trial.\nThe campaign group Justice for Women, which backed Challen\u2019s appeal, say that many women who have killed their violent partners are wrongly convicted of murder because the criminal justice system has failed to recognise such factors.\nMartin, whose appeal will be heard on Tuesday, was 22 and a mother of two small children, when she was convicted of the murder of her partner, Kyle Farrell, in 2015 after stabbing him with a kitchen knife, allegedly during a heated argument in which he attempted to strangle her. Martin\u2019s supporters say she had experienced years of violence and coercive behaviour at Farrell\u2019s hands, but her defence team had failed to obtain evidence of its impact on her mental state at her original trial.\nMagson, whose appeal will be heard on 10 December, was 23 when she was convicted of murdering her partner, James Knight, with a single stab wound. Her lawyers claim she was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) stemming from her childhood exposure to domestic abuse in the family home, parental neglect, bullying and the death of her sister.\nThey also claim that evidence she had witnessed domestic abuse as a child and had been a victim of it as an adult was not heard by the jury because she did not fully participate in the trial due to neuro-developmental difficulties.\nHarriet Wistrich, Challen\u2019s lawyer during her appeal, said the two cases would show whether the criminal justice system now recognised that a range of factors needed to be considered when handing down murder convictions.\n\u201cWe hope the growing understanding of how domestic violence and coercive and controlling behaviour can trap women in very abusive relationships will assist the appeals of two women who, at most, should have been convicted of manslaughter not murder,\u201d Wistrich said.\n\u201cBoth vulnerable women killed in desperate circumstances, yet at trial the context for their actions was not properly understood or explained, resulting in serious miscarriages of justice.\u201d\nIt is understood that members of both women\u2019s families will attend court when their appeals are heard.",

        "content": "Uggs are back, and this time they\u2019re for men. Priya Elan charts the brand that became synonymous with slouch \u2013 and finds the clue is in the name\u2026\nThere was a time when the Ugg boot walked across the earth like a colossus. They were the moccasins-cum-gazelles of their time. It was the early noughties and they were worn by Kate Moss and Beyonc\u00e9, and even made Oprah\u2019s coveted Favourite Things list. But then in a sort of slow-motion version of the time Danniella Westbrook wore Burberry-everything (bag, skirt, baby skirt, baby buggy) and killed the check with one photo-op, the sheepskin-coloured fairy-dust that Uggs were once sprinkled with became mucky.\nThey transformed into the Cheetos-covered uniform of Hollywood bad-girls-on-the-edge, such as Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. Heat magazine regulars including Chantelle Houghton wore them.\nTo walk through the streets of Clapham, south London, in the mid-noughties was to walk through a sea of unrepentant Ugg-led boho-dressing. Pashminas, gypsy tops, bootcut jeans, toe rings, the sound of James Blunt\u2019s You\u2019re Beautiful coming out of every post-university communal flatshare window. And Ugg boots. So many Ugg boots, absolutely everywhere. A sea of muddy brown stretching as far as the eye could see, save for the occasional Ugg over-bracelet that looked like it was made in a self-care workshop on a gap year.\nBy 2012, the Ugg boot became synonymous with the so-called \u201cbasic bitch\u201d: a casual put-down that was associated with a certain sensibility: a lover of Diet Coke breaks, Nicholas Sparks films, Taylor Swift songs and, yes, Uggs. A 2014 definition from Urban Dictionary notes, sadly: \u201cShe believes her experiences to be crazy, wild, and different, or somehow more special than everything that everybody else is doing, when really, almost everyone is doing or has done the exact same thing.\u201d Sales had fallen by 31% and it was official that the Ugg had become the shoe for the stalwart who didn\u2019t like change.\nBut recently something miraculous has been happening. In October, the Lyst report, which analyses the shopping habits of millions of shoppers, found that Uggs had seen a 350% increase in searches over the year. And, even more shockingly, a good percentage of those searches were from men. Last year, the men\u2019s branch of the business made more than $200m, while this year the company estimate sales of their men\u2019s range will make up 13% of its total revenue.\nIt\u2019s a long way from their purple patch when Uggs were exclusively worn by celebrity men \u201cgoing through some bad stuff\u201d. Who could forget the sight of a sad-looking Ben Affleck wearing them on set, Ronnie Wood stepping out in a black pair looking like an ASBO teen, or Leonardo DiCaprio wearing them with a purple velour onesie like some regional Prince tribute act? At that time, the many memes that existed (one simply stating: \u201cUggs for men. No\u201d) pivoted around ideas of masculinity.\nTheir resurgence has been surprising, because in a world of sturdy Red Wing boots or Colorado tan Caterpillars, there\u2019s something flat about Uggs. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against the structured boot that\u2019s become a staple of a man\u2019s winter wardrobe,\u201d thinks GQ columnist Justin Myers, aka The Guyliner.\nIn the years since the Ugg was at its peak, the silhouette in men\u2019s fashion has gone from pencil thin and tight to David Byrne-wide and expansive, and so it would make sense that as your trousers and coat get bigger, so too do your shoes. \u201cFashion is heading slouchier,\u201d explains Myers, \u201cand if wearing a boot that shares DNA with a bean bag is how to achieve that, who am I to argue?\u201d\nStill, the aesthetic appeal (or non-appeal) of the Ugg is something that astounds him. \u201cI\u2019m surprised anyone would be desperate to seek out something so wilfully ugly,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that Ugg\u2019s sheepskin boots and slip-ons are having a bit of a men\u2019s moment, which seems to be driven by an \u2018anything goes\u2019 style,\u201d agrees Esquire\u2019s style director, Jonathan Evans.\nIn a world where the Croc and Birkenstock have gone haute, Margiela\u2019s cloven-hooved shoes exist and the heeled flip-flop is worn by Kim Kardashian, Katie Holmes and Rihanna, perhaps the return of the Ugg isn\u2019t so weird after all.\nIt also helps that the shoe is firmly associated with a time, about 15 years ago, when pumpkin spiced latte was considered edgy. Nostalgia is at a premium at the moment (hiya, J-Lo at the Versace show wearing her old dress, or Marc Jacobs, Celine and Balmain referencing their own halcyonic eras).\n\u201cNostalgic fashion is so popular \u2013 especially now \u2013 because it\u2019s more than just a piece of clothing,\u201d says fashion writer Kristen Bousquet. \u201cMany of these pieces may remind you of something from your childhood or a photo of your mum that you loved from the 60s.\u201d Myers isn\u2019t convinced that this embrace of nostalgic fashion is welcomed equally by both genders. \u201cMen take more convincing; need easing in gently,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are reluctant to look in their mirror and see their father staring back at them.\u201d\nThe Ugg comeback for both sexes has been coming for a while. They drafted in Jeff Daniels and Mr Gisele, Tom Brady, in 2016 for an ad featuring The Dude strumming a guitar while Brady napped on a sofa, both wearing Uggs. It was luxe lounging for the whisky and Bon Iver crowd. A year later, in 2017, Cardi B announced that it was \u201cofficially Ugg season\u201d on Instagram and Heron Preston, a mate of Virgil Abloh, captioned his Ugg boot-wearing Instagram with: \u201cWe not playing games no more.\u201d\nWalking through a railway station one morning, I\u2019m struck by some huge, brightly coloured posters for the latest Ugg campaign (shockingly subtitled: \u201cUgglife\u201d); there\u2019s Slick Woods breastfeeding her baby and Ama Elsesser cradling her sister, Paloma. I go online and see the other stars of their ad campaign: Luka Sabbat and his dad, Kim Gordon and daughter Coco together. They\u2019re slick and well shot.\n\u201cI think part of the resurgence has to be partnerships,\u201d says Esquire\u2019s Evans, \u201cwhether that\u2019s a collaboration like the one the brand did with Bape this year, or on the marketing side with someone like Lil Wayne, who modelled that collection.\u201d\nI notice the men\u2019s shoes. They don\u2019t look like old sacks; in fact, they don\u2019t look like the traditional Uggs. So the success story behind Uggs for men is making shoes that don\u2019t look like Uggs at all. Despite being called \u201cthe male version of the classic Ugg\u201d by VP of marketing Ian Stewart, their most popular men\u2019s shoe, the Neumel, looks more like a chunky desert boot. He says they have been targeting the hip-hop and sports communities, so shifting the association with yoga pants for ever.\nI ask him what he\u2019d say to a potential male buyer. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t experienced them before, I say, \u2018When you put them on it\u2019s not like anything you\u2019ve felt before\u2026 in footwear,\u201d he says breathlessly. I feel slightly uncomfortable with his level of evangelical spiel about the Ugg, but I also feel like, perhaps I should forgive them for being crap in the noughties. Would I ever buy a pair I wonder? \u201cGo Ugg yourself,\u201d I say to myself silently.",

        "content": "A young Irish ex-convict seeking retribution joins forces with an aboriginal tracker in Jennifer Kent\u2019s harrowing drama set in 19th-century Tasmania\nThe Australian writer and director Jennifer Kent carved her initials into the cinematic psyche with her debut, The Babadook, a jangling, twisted domestic chiller featuring moments of throat-constricting parental panic. But her follow-up feature, The Nightingale, is a whole other level of horrifying. It\u2019s a punishing watch; a harrowing film which boots home its message by gouging at the vulnerable soft spots of the audience. Like the world she depicts, Kent\u2019s storytelling shows no mercy.\nSet in Tasmania (or Van Diemen\u2019s Land, as it was then known) in 1825, this period revenge movie brings together sexual politics and post-colonial rage, drawing parallels between the plight of Irish ex-convict Clare (Aisling Franciosi) and that of aboriginal tracker Billy (Baykali Ganambarr). Clare has served her sentence but her fate is dictated by the whims of the cruel British lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin). One such whim robs Clare of all that she holds dear, and sets her on a quest for retribution. To track Hawkins and his cronies, Clare employs Billy to guide her north through the inhospitable bush. Billy too has lost loved ones, identity and pride at the hands of the \u201ccivilising\u201d British.\nLike the film\u2019s boxy aspect ratio, the storytelling is tight and unwavering. The victim\u2019s eye view of sexual violence is just one of several profoundly unsettling elements in a picture that has more in common with the downbeat ache of fellow Australian Warwick Thornton\u2019s aboriginal western Sweet Country than with the brash hyper-assault of the rape vigilantism in Coralie Fargeat\u2019s Revenge.\nBoth Billy and Clare give voice to their defiance through the songs of their people. And it\u2019s this \u2013 the judiciously used music \u2013 that gives us a sense that there\u2019s some beauty left in this world, something worth clinging to.",

        "content": "The venue that first brought London\u2019s gay culture into the mainstream is still going strong today after four decades of glamour, glitz and perspiration\nWhen Heaven opened its doors to the disco-hungry gay hedonists of London 40 years ago this month, it was declared the hippest place in Europe. The reviewer in London\u2019s Evening Standard was right when he guessed the huge nightclub\u2019s appeal would soon make it popular with dancers of all sexual preferences. \u201cHeaven\u2019s biggest headache could be in deterring London\u2019s non-gay discophiles who could end up trying to pass for gay to get past the elegant bouncers at the disco\u2019s equivalent of the Pearly Gates,\u201d he predicted.\nThose not born in 1979 may know the club\u2019s fabled history as the early home of house music and have seen it featured in videos and documentaries. Or perhaps watched the opening credits of Tony Scott\u2019s 1983 vampire film, The Hunger, as Bauhaus sings the hit Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead while David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve skulk around the club in sunglasses. But back then, for members of London\u2019s burgeoning gay scene, the arrival of Heaven was the moment when a rich hidden culture became part of mainstream nightlife. It was also quickly established as a key venue for bands.\n\u201cThe first time I went, I saw New Order play. It was just post-Joy Division in 1981,\u201d says Mark Ellicott, who has been running the club in Charing Cross for 11 years. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many venues in London that have had a more seismic influence on the club scene.\u201d Ellicott adds that, to mark the big birthday, the club has won permission to operate as a marriage venue, with the first ceremony to take place on 15 December, almost exactly 40 years after the opening night.\nWhile Heaven\u2019s arrival had an impact, it drew on strands of alternative disco culture already threading through the city in the 12 years since homosexuality had been decriminalised. Customers at established gay dancefloors and discreet venues, such as Bang, Napoleons, Scandals and Catacombs, had initially moved on to a club on Old Bond Street called the Embassy, opened in 1978 by Jeremy Norman. Norman aimed to provide Londoners with the kind of experience the avant garde and creative elite were already enjoying at Studio 54 in New York.\nBy the time Margaret Thatcher had been in power for six months, Norman, who was also chairman of the posh publisher Burke\u2019s Peerage, had made a fresh move. He took over the a vast disused roller disco under the arches near Charing Cross Station and set up Europe\u2019s biggest club venue: Heaven.\n\u201cPrior to that, gay clubs were only found underground in pub cellars,\u201d recalls Ellicott. \u201cHeaven was the only venue of its scale in the last few years before the arrival of the Aids epidemic. Inevitably, young people now don\u2019t realise the importance of a single institution, but there is an appreciation among those in the know.\u201d\nThat institution is now to be celebrated in a reunion night, Return to Rage, at the club on Sunday 8 December. (Rage, featuring the DJs Fabio and Grooverider, was the original regular jungle and drum \u2019n\u2019 bass night run from the late 1980s into the 1990s.) A documentary \u2013 made by On The Bus Productions \u2013 about the club is also due out next year, followed by another anniversary club night, Return to Heaven, being staged in early spring next year.\n\u201cI was DJ-ing there in the late 80s and early 90s, and the visual effects were amazing,\u201d says Steve Whyte. \u201cThere were often people in amazing costumes, and it all had a massive visual presence. We all felt comfortable in that environment. Until then, it would have been difficult for people to tell people you had been to a gay club.\u201d\nWhyte and his business partner, Simon Needham, are behind next year\u2019s anniversary club night, and Whyte will be interviewed by the documentary-makers, along with Heaven regular Boy George and its former owner, Richard Branson.\n\u201cWhen it started it was still difficult for gay people to be accepted. But Heaven was a place that changed perspectives and brought the two communities, gay and straight, together,\u201d says Whyte. \u201cWhen they opened the club to other people on different nights, that broke down the barriers. It was incredible.\u201d\nSocial liberation did not stop tabloid newspapers producing a string of critical headlines. In 1981, The News of the World condemned the place as \u201cmore like hell\u201d, and eight years later the Sun came down hard on drug use.\nThe club\u2019s first resident DJ was Ian Levine, frequently cited as the father of the Original Heaven Sound. Big names such as DJ Paul Oakenfold and club host Philip Sallon followed.\nAmong the bands closely associated with the venue are Throbbing Gristle, who played there in 1980 and returned 29 years later for a last London show, and Nick Cave\u2019s original band, the Birthday Party, who played the club in 1982.\nBranson\u2019s Virgin Group bought Heaven from Norman that year, as the \u201cpink pound\u201d started to count, but Branson sold the club in 2003 to a consortium known as Pure Group. Five years later, the game of pass-the-parcel continued when Mama Group, in partnership with Jeremy Joseph, founder of the influential G-A-Y night at the Astoria, bought Heaven and moved G-A-Y to the venue. This group was bought in turn by HMV and then, when the music retailer went into administration in 2013, Joseph got it all back by acquiring the outstanding shares in G-A-Y Ltd.\nAnd so the Heaven tradition continues. Doors swing open on themed club nights each week, ranging from Popcorn on Monday to Camp Attack on Friday.In a fortnight, two men from Wales will be the venue\u2019s first wedding couple. \u201cIf you had said in 1981, when that News Of The World piece came out, that one day we would host LGBT weddings, nobody would have believed you,\u201d says Ellicott.",
