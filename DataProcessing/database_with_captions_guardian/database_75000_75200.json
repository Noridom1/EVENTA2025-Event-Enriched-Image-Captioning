Some of the most poignant, moving and funny memoirs have been written by people who held the belief that they had something interesting to say, and that there might be an audience for it.\nThe process itself begins with an idea - and this is the easy part, since it\u2019s most likely an idea born from your personal experiences. But how do you develop those ideas into an angle that will make people want to keep reading? This weekend masterclass with Gavin Evans builds on his short memoir-writing class, to invite you to dig a little deeper.\nOver the two days, you will learn how to expand the seed of your idea into one sentence, and then one page. Drawing on the work of other memoir writers, you will also explore the technical aspects of form and style, voice and tone, and tense. Gavin will also take you through how to structure your work into chapters, and you will have the opportunity to receive personal feedback on your writing from Gavin.\nYou will also learn about the publishing trade and how to \u2018market\u2019 yourself and your story, and you will complete this weekend course with a newfound confidence in your abilities to keep going.\nYour memoir idea in one sentence\nYour memoir idea in 150 words\nHow to present yourself with voice, tone and tense\nHow to structure your story in 15 chapters\nThe building blocks of a good chapter\nGetting published\nGavin Evans has written eight non-fiction books, including his memoir, Dancing Shoes is Dead, three sporting biographies, three books on popular science and a coffee table sports book. He lectures in the Media and Culture department at Birkbeck College, University of London, and supervises journalism master\u2019s students at Cardiff University. He has also worked as a journalist for more than 30 years and has recently written for the Guardian, the New Internationalist, the International Business Times, the Daily Mirror and BBC History Magazine.

He has disabilities following a stroke more than a decade ago.\nYakiv left his London home the day after the war started on 25 February and drove to Ukraine\u2019s border with Poland to rescue his wife and daughter. Reuniting with them on the edge of a war zone appeared more straightforward than obtaining the UK visas.\nHe travelled from the UK to France by ferry, explained to immigration officials in Dover that he was rescuing family members from a war zone and asked what paperwork would be needed to bring his family into the UK.\nHe said he was told none would be needed and that the family should simply present themselves to officials in Calais after he had reunited with them.\nThe family did this on 27 February but were told by UK immigration officials that Oksana and Veronika would be refused permission to enter the UK. Both were detained for five hours. They were detained a second time on Monday (7 March) for just over an hour even though by this time the mother and daughter had their visas in their passports. They were temporarily detained under what is known as IS81, which gives immigration officers \u201cauthority to detain for further examination\u201d.\n\u201cIn Paris they said to fill in an online form, but we got to the bit where they were asking for \u00a32,200 per person for medical insurance and could get no further. So we went to the British embassy to ask for help. I showed my British passport but the embassy said they couldn\u2019t do anything to help and we were in the wrong place,\u201d said Yakiv.\n\u201cThen we went to the British consulate. Here we found the only helpful British person we had come across. He gave us \u20ac50 so we could take a taxi to a hotel and he called the visa section to ask them to help us fill in the form.\u201d\nThe Voloshchuks were put in touch with Sarah Preston, an English woman living in Burgundy, who has been helping Ukrainians fleeing the war find accommodation.\nThe family was put up by Michel Guyot who owns the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Fargeau in Burgundy, which has a farm and guest accommodation.\n\u201cEveryone in Poland and France was wonderful to Ukrainians. We are not coming by choice but because of war and we are not coming to collect benefits. I have a house where my family can stay. Once my daughter has learned English she can go to school and my wife can work,\u201d said Yakiv.\nOksana said: \u201cPeople are being shuttled back and forth between Calais and Paris. Why not set up two computers and five people in Calais to check biometric passports and issue visas. There are people with no money, no car, with babies, being pushed back and forth.\u201d\nYakiv said that while the family was happy to now be together and safe in the UK, they were all deeply traumatised by the war and scanning the news every minute. Their experience with the British authorities in Paris had compounded that trauma.\n\u201cThe treatment we received from the French and the British has been so different. The French were so lovely. I can\u2019t understand why the British could do nothing to help us.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working to process applications as quickly as possible and submitting an application in English reduces delays, which means we can get people here more efficiently. However, if someone is unable to provide translated documents they should still submit their application with untranslated documents. Support is available to applicants through our free 24/7 helpline and in visa application centres.\u201d",

        "content": "A flat pitch generated a run-fest but high security and incessant noise made the first Pakistan v Australia Test memorable\nAs far as the cricket goes, you can probably gather all you need to know from the fact that it was the first Test in history with a century opening partnership for three innings in a row. Or from the fact that Australia never got close to batting a second time. In the end Pakistan made 728 runs for the loss of four wickets in the match. Fold in the Australian innings and it read 1187 for 14. What else could be expected on a pitch the colour and character of a tranquilised labrador.\nThose conditions were the home team\u2019s choice. Usually the Rawalpindi surface is green with grass and helpful for pace, but after Pakistan\u2019s fast bowlers were scythed down by illness and injury, they turned the mower as ruthlessly on to the pitch itself. Fear of Australia\u2019s bowling supremacy saw Pakistan surrender the team\u2019s own edge: Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah showed pace and skill despite the lack of assistance, but were left a task too tall.\nBut still, in other ways none of that seemed to matter. A team of Australians were playing Test cricket at Rawalpindi, the ground last trod by Mark Taylor when he made his famous triple century in 1998, and the match itself was secondary to everything that surrounded it for the full five days.\nTake the sound. Never at a cricket ground would you expect to hear such a sound. Hundreds of small horns, each being blown to form a single buzzing note. Abrasive on their own, annoying in clusters. But as each one in the ground was sounded at once, such as on the four occasions when Pakistan players reached centuries, the individual parts joined into something bigger, something singular, the noise vibrating through your body as if you were only a conduit.\nTake the weaponry. Never for a cricket match would you expect to see this. Police and soldiers stationed along highways, clustered under trees, riding in the backs of trucks that bristled with rifle barrels like war-bound porcupines. Snipers on the rooftops of hotel and stadium. Trucks and checkpoints and barricades for blocks around. Sniffer dogs and bomb-finders and metal detectors. Tall saturnine rangers. Through it all, chatter and jokes at each stop along the way, the camouflaged man checking your bag for the fourth time smiling brightly and asking: \u201cHow are you enjoying our security?\u201d Even with this contribution, the clear sense of pride.\nThis stat is an eye-popper. In 145 years of men's Test cricket, there have been 12 matches where an opening partnership has made a century stand in both innings.Abdullah Shafique has done it twice, and has played three Tests.#PakvAus\nTake the enthusiasm. On the final day, with the match all but mummified for display in a museum, the crowd still suffused it with life. Crowds of school-age girls matched Pakistan flag face-paint with hijabs while taking endless rounds of selfies in the stands, before their half-day adventure was over and they were back to class. Pindi Boys strutted the concourse with the vocalising and the strut of the residents of the Poultry Research Institute next to the stadium. Mosh-pits of fans still celebrating with the score at none for 220.\nThere was no thought of a declaration, Pakistan choosing instead to keep Australia in the field with only three days until the next match. There was the ceremonial finishing move of Usman Khawaja becoming the ninth player to bowl, in front of the crowd from the town of his birth, a man with a solitary first-class wicket taken back in 2010. There was the Azan echoing over the ground from the towers of the Bait-ul-Mukurram mosque. Rush to prayer, rush to prayer. There was something that mattered in every part of this, something affirmed.",

The armoured car pauses for a moment then turns to disappear across the junction followed by other armoured vehicles that come into view.\nIn the second incident reported on Tuesday, the head of Mykolaiv\u2019s regional council, Anna Zamazeeva \u2013 a city currently under Russian attack \u2013 claimed three teachers who had been travelling by minibus to an orphanage for a shift change had been killed and two others wounded when their vehicle, marked with a red cross, came under fire.\nThe latest two incidents come on top of the widely reported case of Anastasiia Yalanskaya, 26, who was shot and killed in her car by Russian forces after delivering food to a dog shelter outside Kyiv.\nYalanskaya, who had posted details of her plans to deliver food to the shelter, was one of three volunteers who travelled to Bucha, 18 miles (29km) outside of Kyiv.\nA few days before, Yalanskaya had detailed another trip to deliver aid to a nursery near Kyiv. \u201cBlown up bridges and roads are terrible, houses destroyed by rockets, it\u2019s monstrous,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf there is a sign [that says] \u2018do not slow down\u2019, you must obey.\u201d",

But the moment it becomes where my name is getting shamed, it becomes an issue.\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of let it go in the past because it never really bothered me. But it really kind of hit me the other day. Me and my wife were at teacher-parent conferences for my son. And the teacher told me, \u2018[Westbrook\u2019s son] Noah, he\u2019s so proud of his last name. He writes it everywhere. He writes it on everything. He tells everybody and walks around and says, \u2018I\u2019m Westbrook.\u2019 ... And I kind of sat there in shock, and it hit me, like, \u2018Damn.

And it\u2019s gotten so bad where my family don\u2019t even want to go to home games, to any game ... and it\u2019s just super unfortunate, man.

It\u2019s just unfortunate.\u201d\nThe Lakers started the season as favorites to win the NBA title after adding veterans such as Carmelo Anthony and Westbrook to a roster than includes LeBron James and Anthony Davis. However they have struggled mightily, particularly in recent months, and are now 11.5 games behind the Denver Nuggets, who occupy the final automatic qualifying place for the playoffs. If the season ended today, the Lakers would be forced into a play-in tournament to qualify for the first-round of the playoffs.",

        "content": "She sings naked, had an epiphany chopping wood in Sweden, came out dressed as a cat, is making a sitcom with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and is helping Matt Lucas to be funny. Meet comedy powerhouse Jordan Gray\n\n\u2018I decided that I wanted to be a comedian on live TV,\u201d says screenwriter and standup Jordan Gray. It was 2016 and she was competing on The Voice as the talent show\u2019s first transgender contestant in the UK under the moniker Tall Dark Friend. Between performances, host Marvin Humes handed the microphone to Gray. \u201cI was just riffing and thought: \u2018This is so much more fun than all that other bit.\u2019\u201d\nNow when Gray performs songs, they\u2019re part of her comedy act. She is currently preparing a show for the Edinburgh festival fringe, combining her love of superheroes, experiences as a trans woman and Essex roots under the title Is It a Bird? \u201cThe conceit is that I may be the next stage of human evolution,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m literally an X-Man.\u201d\nBut her comedy ambitions have already sprawled beyond the stage. She\u2019s currently developing a sitcom with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, working as Matt Lucas\u2019s script consultant, and has an autobiographical radio comedy in the works. Not bad for someone who has only been in the business four years.\nWhen she started in 2017, her act was made up of jokes about her music career and \u201cnaturally, a lot about being transgender. People go into a show with an inherent tension about certain things. If you can pop that, you get an easy laugh and then we can start a dialogue. But even from that very first gig, no cliches.\u201d\nCliches are something she has seen novice trans standups fall back on. \u201cSome are reappropriating the jokes that the public make about us all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut let\u2019s give the audience stuff they can\u2019t come up with.\u201d The originality of others, such as standup and host of Peak Trans podcast Jen Ives, is an inspiration, \u201cShe makes me want to be a better transgender comedian,\u201d says Gray.\nGray, 33, grew up \u201call over Essex\u201d, and after stints in Scotland and Sweden is now back in Southend. She began her music career before her transition but had an \u201cepiphany moment\u201d at 24 while chopping firewood on a Swedish ranch: \u201cI just had a feeling that it was all a bit wrong.\u201d A year later Gray was dressed as a cat, accepting a trophy for best original artist at the Essex Entertainment awards, when she publicly came out as transgender.\nShe did her first Edinburgh fringe run in 2018 and, during the infamously raucous Late\u2019n\u2019Live comedy showcase, stripped off on stage. \u201cAs a gesture it says: \u2018I\u2019m all in, do you want to come all in too?\u2019\u201d she says. Now, it makes for a defiantly NSFW but surprisingly poignant finale. Completely naked, Gray sings a powerful number about the way people project on to trans people. Sat at her keyboard, she ends, softly, with the line: \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a joke, I might as well be in on it.\u201d\nShe regularly brings audiences to standing ovations and you can sense her energy just from watching footage of previous performances online. \u201cPerforming has turned into quite an emotional thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s empowering to be what a lot of people might see as incomplete on stage.\u201d\nShe adds: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on any minority to fly the flag. While I\u2019m happy to do that, I\u2019m a comedian first.\u201d\nGray brings this ethos to Transaction, her web series for Comedy Central about Liv, a transgender woman who works in a slightly dystopian supermarket with her best friend and supervisor, Tom. In the series, Gray tackles the liberal tendency to put people on a pedestal simply for being transgender. Liv has a colossal ego, she is sometimes problematic, she\u2019s \u201ca steamroller of a human\u201d, Gray says. \u201cShe\u2019s a cautionary tale. We\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d\nNow being developed for TV by Pegg and Frost, Transaction picks at the question of who can make jokes about what. \u201cI want it to feel like two comedians bantering,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIf a friend of mine makes a very good, clever transgender joke about me, it\u2019s a compliment, because it means \u2018I know you so well\u2019. Comedy cuts through the bullshit.\u201d\nWorking with the British comedy talents has been brilliant, Gray says. \u201cPegg is the biggest transgender advocate I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe\u2019s just a very lovely woke bloke.\u201d\nGray believes that commissioning a whole variety of trans creatives would be the best response to things such as the controversy over Dave Chappelle\u2019s Netflix special The Closer, in which he made a series of derogatory comments about the trans community. While she enjoyed his previous specials: \u201cIt\u2019s painful when a master craftsman trips up and does something lazy. It just wasn\u2019t funny. Transgender people are the ones getting it in the ear off the back of these flippant comments.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t believe in boycotting the streaming platform over Chappelle though: \u201cTo turn people into a symbol is dangerous. Maybe that\u2019s why I wanted to do a show about superheroes, because that\u2019s their whole shtick \u2013 boiling people down to one symbol.\u201d\nGray is currently working as a script consultant on a new TV show from Lucas and Bert Tyler-Moore. \u201cThey were keen they didn\u2019t come across as flippant when portraying transgender people,\u201d she says. \u201cThe minutiae of what it\u2019s really like to be transgender can be very funny, but how truthful can we be without losing the comedy?\u201d\nShe highlighted the importance of distinguishing the stance of characters from the stance of the show. \u201cPeople are still forming their opinions about what \u2018transgender\u2019 is,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s characterising to have somebody use very old-fashioned phrases like \u2018sex change\u2019 or \u2018tranny\u2019 if it\u2019s a character we don\u2019t want to like. But until that\u2019s established, it seems like it\u2019s the show\u2019s opinion. If the character is established, then the viewer says: \u2018OK, that\u2019s because that character is ill-informed, not the show.\u2019\u201d\nGray is adamant that the main goal of her work is to be funny. But it would be a \u201cnice bonus\u201d, she says, if she can accurately get across how normal life as a transgender person can be. \u201cIronically, I think there\u2019s something very relatable about the transgender situation,\u201d she says. \u201cAt some point, we all look in the mirror and want to be different.\u201d\n Jordan Gray plays Stamptown at Soho theatre, London, on 11 March.",

        "content": "Kwon Oh-Seung\u2019s impressive debut cleverly uses social sexism to ramp up disbelief in his female characters \nThis twisty-turny thriller from South Korea is an impressive, auspicious debut for writer-director Kwon Oh-Seung; taut as a piano-wire garotte, it\u2019s compelling as a genre exercise. But it also offers a (possibly accidental) critique of a culture that often treats women and disabled people as inferior to able-bodied men. That latter point is extremely well illustrated late in Midnight when heroine Kyung Mi (Jin Ki-joo), a young deaf woman, keeps trying to get help from the cops or onlookers in a crowded street only to find people usually inclined to believe her pursuer, serial killer Do Shik (Wi Ha-Joon, best known as the handsome cop from Squid Game, magnificent here as a baddie) because he\u2019s such a good actor, skilled at implying she\u2019s \u201chysterical\u201d or \u201cdamaged\u201d.\nUnlucky Kyung Mi just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when she interrupted Do Shik while he was in the process of attacking another young woman, So Jung (Kim Hye-Yoon), whose incredibly controlling brother Tak So (Park Hoon) warned her not to stay out too late. Annoyingly, it turns out he was sort of right.\nAt least it\u2019s the women who show mettle, resourcefulness and compassion, and that also goes for Kyung Mi\u2019s deaf mother (Kil Hae-yeon); the men are largely thugs, dopes or in Do Shik\u2019s case, straight up killers. While Kyung Mi and her mum\u2019s deafness and skill with sign language puts a spin on things, the script doesn\u2019t patronise them by making them more noble or more vulnerable, nor does deafness define their characters. Unsurprisingly, the film uses sound and silence inventively \u2013 both to simulate how the world sounds to its deaf characters but also to crank up the tension. That said, Kwon can\u2019t resist over-egging the pudding in the final act with a protracted, borderline-silly finale; but even that excess makes it interesting.\n Midnight is released on 14 March on digital platforms.",

        "content": "Unable to afford insurance against increasingly common inundations, many have no option but to stay and rebuild\nIn their simple home on the banks of the Tweed River, Peter and Linda Bale sat on the couch in ankle-deep water, trying not to panic.\nOutside, the streets that criss-cross the sprawling Chinderah caravan parks had become canals, another scene of horror in the New South Wales\u2019 Northern Rivers disaster.\n\u201cWe could just feel it creeping up our legs,\u201d Linda tells the Guardian, fighting back tears. \u201cIt was coming up so fast.\u201d\nFor Peter, there was an added complication.\nHe is fighting stage four lung cancer, diagnosed as terminal. For two hours, his breathing grew increasingly strained as the floodwaters rose.\nTheir saviour came in an unlikely form. A jetski appeared outside, ridden by a stranger.\nIt was Api Robin, the husband of comedian Celeste Barber.\n\u201cI had the cats, both of them in a cat cage and tied them onto the mat on the back of the jetski, and I had one of our little dogs in front of me, squashed in between me and him,\u201d Linda says.\n\u201cOver the roar of the water and the jetski, all I could hear was [the cats screeching].\u201d\nOn Tuesday, under a stifling sun and blue skies, Linda and Peter returned to again survey the damage.\nLike all visitors to the park, they drove in past a grim spectacle.\nAlong the road straddling the Tweed, was a wall, seemingly never-ending, of destroyed furniture, waterlogged mattresses, mouldy clothes, and useless white goods.\nA staggering 180 of the 220 permanent sites were inundated. More than 300 residents were affected. Even more were destroyed at Chinderah\u2019s other four caravan parks, all located in a two kilometre arc around the riverbank.\nIt is devastation on a confounding scale.\nMost in these parks did not have much before the floods. Now, they have been left with nothing, save for the clothes on their backs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just devastating,\u201d Linda says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been inside, that\u2019s our life, in those boxes. That\u2019s what\u2019s left.\u201d\nVery few residents could afford the exorbitant cost of flood insurance in the low-lying caravan parks. The Bales were quoted $10,000 per year, a figure well out of reach, even before the costs associated with Peter\u2019s cancer.\nNow, residents are left with an invidious choice. Without insurance money, attempting to buy a new home away from the floodplain is not an option for most.\nBut the parks have flooded twice in five years.\nMany have no option but to stay, attempt to rebuild, and hope, against all global heating predictions, that the next floods don\u2019t come so soon.\nHeather Emmett has been in the park for six years. Her home was ruined in both 2017 and 2022.\nBut when the Guardian encounters her, riding her white bicycle through the park, she is a picture of optimism.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be doing. Maybe riding off into the sunset on my bike, with a bottle of wine in my backpack,\u201d she laughs.\n\u201cWe just get ourselves up, shake ourselves off, and start all over again.\u201d\nEmmett has been staying with her close friend, Debbie Prater, away from the park. Her future remains uncertain.\n\u201cAs soon as it happened, I said \u2018I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m gone\u2019. But I don\u2019t have enough money or equity or anything,\u201d she said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cIt was insured because I bought it cheap, but it\u2019s not insured enough for the prices that they are now. And there would be so many people who would be in the same boat.\u201d\n\u201cThey have to stay where they are.\u201d\nPrater is the same. She only bought her home in the caravan park 12 months ago, after moving from Armidale to be closer to family.\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to go anywhere else, just yet,\u201d she says.\nShe has no flood insurance. \u201cI was a giver, so I never had any money left at all, with my kids and various things,\u201d she said.\nThere is almost universal frustration and puzzlement at the lack of official government response in the parks.\nMost residents who spoke to the Guardian said they hadn\u2019t seen anyone from the government, federal or state, who had come to help. One resident said she saw a State Emergency Service vehicle drive around the park and then leave.\nThe absence of government services is particularly bewildering, given many across the six caravan parks are in dire need of financial assistance.\nBut, like so many places in the Northern Rivers disaster zone, volunteers have stepped into the breach.\nA group of volunteers were busy cleaning and drying the Bales\u2019 remaining possessions on Tuesday. They turned up from nowhere and got straight to work.\nMeanwhile, their friend, Tanya Slaven, was busy scrubbing the walls of mould on Tuesday. Peter\u2019s lung cancer makes cleaning it particularly crucial.\nSlaven has also set up a GoFundMe to help raise money for the pair, and her uncle and aunt have put up the Bales while they get back on their feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for them to accept it. But finally they are,\u201d she said.\nJohn Anderson, who is helping to manage Tweeds Shores and Chinderah Lakes parks\u2019 disaster response, can barely keep it together when asked about the work of the volunteers.\n\u201cThe response has been \u2026 I can\u2019t even talk about it, mate, or I\u2019ll lose it,\u201d he said.\nHe said there is assistance coming from the state government for uninsured residents.\nBut Anderson has a simple message for the nation\u2019s leaders. Something must be done about climate change, or the disaster scenes playing out at the parks will become an inevitable regularity.\n\u201cI wish they\u2019d start getting real,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Lismore council says waste will be transferred to a quarry site identified by state government near Teven\nMountains of waste pulled from flood-ravaged homes and businesses along Australia\u2019s east coast are heading for landfill sites and temporary storage, but questions are being raised over a New South Wales government plan to store the rotting mounds at a quarry.\nIn Brisbane, the city\u2019s mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the floods had generated a year\u2019s worth of landfill. Almost 30,000 cubic metres have already been dropped at council tips and recycling centres, but how much more is left was not known.\nCouncils hit by floods were worried piles of rubbish could become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and attract rats and mice.\nWaste industry groups called for better planning for disasters, saying there was a lack of areas at landfill sites that were being held in contingency for major events.\nIn flooded Lismore in the Northern Rivers region of NSW, the council, contractors, fire and rescue officers and defence personnel were collecting more than 1,000 tonnes of flood waste every day and moving it to a temporary site at a tip in East Lismore.\nJohn Walker, the general manager of Lismore city council, said the state government was taking over the job of collecting and removing the waste.\nFrom Wednesday, he said, all the waste would start to be transferred to a quarry site the state government had identified near the village of Teven \u2013 30km east.\nWalker said: \u201cSome of this problem is it\u2019s just unsightly. But if there\u2019s food, it rots and then we can get vermin coming in.\u201d\nHe said the council anticipated it would be two weeks before all the debris was cleared.\n\u201cPeople there are traumatised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sits on the street. Ultimately it\u2019s totally depressing and it\u2019s really important we clean it up.\n\u201cI think recycling is off the agenda. It\u2019s just a pile of mess.\u201d\nAdam Guise, a Lismore councillor for the Greens, says the sight of the wall of flood-damaged materials along kerbs through the town was \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking.\u201d\n\u201cFor me, as an environmentalist, this is a tragedy. This is the side effect of disasters like this where so much waste is generated. Everything from people\u2019s homes is on the street. The environmental consequences are astronomical.\u201d\nGuise\u2019s own house in north Lismore, which escaped flooding in 2017, was inundated this time with water up to the ceilings.\n\u201cI expected maybe a foot or two in the house, but it got to the ceilings. We lost everything that was in the house. It\u2019s all on the kerb like everyone else\u2019s.\n\u201cWe should be pulling out all the stops to generate facilities that can \u2013 en masse \u2013 deal with waste like this and find other markets for it. Homes here are made from hardwood timber from old growth forests and that\u2019s a crime if it ends up in landfill.\u201d\nColin Sweet, chief executive of the Australian Landfill Owners Association, which has councils and private industry among its members, said in NSW and Queensland there was a lack of planning to cope with sudden influxes of waste into landfills from disasters.\nThere was no shortage of landfill sites, but there was a shortage of landfill cells \u2013 areas prepared to environmental regulations that include linings to prevent leaching \u2013 and infrastructure to channel methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, that is generated as waste rots.\nOn the plan to use a quarry, Sweet said: \u201cThis is what comes up when we don\u2019t have enough space. Environmental management becomes compromised.\n\u201cIf you just throw it in a quarry there\u2019s no leachate management \u2013 it\u2019s like throwing it in the back yard and pretending it\u2019s not there.\u201d\nIn Gympie, one of the first towns to be flooded north of Brisbane, the city council told the Guardian the public tip had seen almost 4,000 drops since last Tuesday \u2013 six times the usual rate.\nA council statement said the amount of waste was unprecedented and while some material could be stored, a majority would go to landfill \u201cand this will unfortunately shorten the life of the current cell, which is in a critical way for space at the moment\u201d.\nSodden rubbish could become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and attract vermin, the statement said.\nBrisbane city council told the Guardian that up to Monday almost 30,000 cubic metres of waste had been collected.\nJust over half had been taken by residents to resource recovery centres around the city, with the rest being collected from the kerb by council workers, contractors and ADF personnel, who the council said were \u201cworking tirelessly to remove items, which are both unsightly and unsafe\u201d.\nThe council could not say how much was still to be collected \u2013 122 food waste bins have been placed in flood-hit suburbs.\nGeorgina Davis, CEO of the Waste and Recycling Industry Association of Queensland, said the number of businesses affected was \u201cunprecedented and well in excess of [the 2011 Brisbane floods]\u201d.\nShe said since 2011 landfill capacity in south-east Queensland had fallen and there was no new capacity being planned.\nAreas used after the 2011 floods \u201chave since been built on and are no longer accessible\u201d, she said, and a lack of large scale emergency response planning meant \u201crecovery will become more difficult for our communities\u201d.\nThe association\u2019s own members had been hit, with depots and assets flooded and infrastructure damaged.\nShe said waste collected from kerbs was being taken to intermediary facilities so some items like metals from white goods, as well as timber, garden waste and some building materials could be recovered. In the city\u2019s 2011 floods, about 60% of the waste by weight was recovered.\nTony Khoury, the executive director of the Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association of NSW, said: \u201cFlood waters carry risks such as water-borne diseases and the key priority is the prompt collection and landfilling of all waste.\u201d\nHe said because most waste was collected in compactor trucks \u201cthere is little opportunity for reuse or recycling of flood affected waste\u201d.\nLast week, the NSW government said people in 17 local government areas would not have to pay the state\u2019s waste levy if they took building materials, furniture and any other flood-generated waste to landfill sites. That number has this week risen to 45.\nA NSW government statement said \u201cregional emergency waste storage sites\u201d had been identified in the Northern Rivers region. The quarry site had been inspected by EPA officials and environmental controls would be checked on Thursday, the statement said.\nSome $210m had been announced to coordinate the clean-up, with fire and rescue personnel and ADF helping residents and businesses, and the government was committed to working with councils and the community.\n\u201cThe sheer volume of waste material makes the recovery of recyclable material challenging,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, attempts to recover separated materials, such as whitegoods and green waste, may be possible.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Queensland environment minister, Meghan Scanlon, said 19 councils had been given $1m each to help the clean-up and 12 waste levy exemptions had been issued for 12 councils.\nCouncils had disaster plans and the state gave advice and support for dealing with waste, she said.\n\u201cWith unprecedented flooding in both large swathes of Queensland and NSW, the issue here isn\u2019t capacity at our landfills, but capacity for council contractors and industry to pick up waste,\u201d she said.\nWaste sector representatives were being consulted \u201cto determine their processing capabilities to help manage the clean-up,\u201d Scanlon added.",

        "content": "Experts explain how to prevent mould and mildew taking hold, and what to do if it already has\nMany parts of Australia\u2019s east coast are enduring a record wet start to the year, with frequent deluges and storms. Thousands of homes have been flooded in Queensland and New South Wales, while many more residents are noticing the effects of the damp and humid weather.\nIn these conditions, mould thrives. And if not dealt with, mould growth can have adverse affects on health.\nHere, experts explain how to prevent mould taking hold, and what to do if it already has.\nBrad Prezant, an occupational hygienist describes mould as \u201ca visible consequence of excessive dampness\u201d.\nMould usually looks like a \u201cfibrous growth\u201d on indoor surfaces like ceilings and walls, and can range from colourless to brown, yellow, green or blue. Tiny \u201cthread like things\u201d form its body, and contain very small spores that float in the air and spread when disturbed.\nExpect to see mould when there is an excess of moisture in the air, combined with an absence of ventilation.\n\u201cIf humidity stays above 85%, moisture absorbs into building materials and dusts on surfaces,\u201d Prezant says. That absorbed moisture allows spores to germinate, which can cause a mass of mould to spread.\nProf Dee Carter, of the University of Sydney\u2019s school of life and environmental sciences says it is not surprising there has been an increase in mould in homes this year.\nAs unprecedented flooding follows a humid La Ni\u00f1a summer, \u201csubstrates like roofs, ceilings, and wood are becoming more saturated \u2026 And this is where mould thrives\u201d.\nMould can lead to several respiratory health problems.\n\u201cIt can cause upper respiratory infection, and exacerbate asthma, especially when people are spending up to 24 hours a day in their homes,\u201d Prezant says.\nCarter says people may experience what are referred to as \u201csick building symptoms\u201d, where people get wheezy, sneezy, or suffer from headaches and irritated eyes.\n\u201cThese are classic allergy and asthma-type symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is because moulds give off volatile compounds that contaminate the air, and spores that irritate people\u2019s airways.\u201d\nVentilation is the key.\n\u201cIf you take away the moisture, the mould won\u2019t grow,\u201d Prezant says.\nHe suggests controlling indoor humidity with either an air conditioner or dehumidifier. Carter says it is best to run a dehumidifier for up to two hours a day per room.\nPreventing rain and humidity from getting indoors is also crucial \u2013 this means only opening windows for air circulation if the air outdoors is dry.\nPrezant suggests focusing on kitchen and bathroom ventilation. This includes turning fans on when excess water accumulates in bathrooms and avoiding unnecessary moisture entering an indoor space, like emptying wet clothes from a drying rack into rooms with no ventilation.\n\u201cHouses are not designed to get wet,\u201d he says. \u201cSo either don\u2019t release moisture into it, or have sufficient ventilation.\u201d\nThere are different cleaning methods recommended depending on where the mould originated.\nIf mould is growing in a spot like the bottom of a window, where glass meets wood, Prezant says \u201cthere might not be much moisture inside the wood\u201d. In this scenario, he says mould is most likely a result of condensation on the glass plane dripping down and \u201cyou could just wipe it off\u201d.\nWhen cleaning surface mould like this, Carter says to avoid \u201cmost bleach products on the market\u201d. Instead, she recommends a vinegar solution of white vinegar from a supermarket, diluted in water to a ratio of 1:5.\n\u201cVinegar will clean mould off the surface and penetrate into the substrate to kill the mould.\u201d\nDepending on the level of contamination, and concern about experiencing allergy symptoms, Carter recommends wearing a mask and gloves while cleaning mould. \u201cEspecially if it looks like it is getting hairy, or the surface looks powdery,\u201d she says.\nCarter says to keep in mind that mould \u201cmight be disturbed as you are cleaning\u201d. This may seed more mould growth. To avoid this, use the vinegar solution in a misting bottle, and spray the surface before touching it. Also avoid banging the surface, or doing anything disruptive that could dislodge spores and send them into the air.\nIf dealing with high levels of moisture related to the escape of liquid from plumbing or indoor flooding, Prezant says a different approach is needed.\nIf mould is growing as a result of the shower leaking, for instance, removing it involves bringing up the plaster board. \u201cIt won\u2019t be so easily controlled until the leak is stopped,\u201d Prezant says. Or if your ceiling is mouldy because of a leak in the roof, your ceiling plasterboard \u201cmay be soaked\u201d.\n\u201cYou may wipe it off the paint surface, but water in the plasterboard and paper behind that paint is going to keep growing,\u201d he says.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nCarter also says certain kinds of mould are worse than others. Black moulds in particular can produce potent toxins and require professionals to remediate the property.\nExperts would enter the affected building in protective gear to remove the contaminated material. If the material cannot be removed, they will \u201cwork on trying to kill that mould\u201d.\nPrezant says contractors should also be used when dealing with extensive mould. He says experts will know how to stop the spread of mould in future by containing \u201call the tiny spores\u201d.\nPrezant says there is not much difference between mould found on walls and mildew found on clothes.\nThe air is relatively still inside a wardrobe. If high-moisture air infiltrates the space, Prezant says you can expect some condensation on clothing, shoes and anything else in the wardrobe.\nEach material has a different propensity to grow mould \u2013 this will determine what items affected by mildew can be salvaged.\nMildew growth is often superficial on leather footwear, for example. \u201cIt is possible the mould is growing on dust or dirt on the surface,\u201d Prezant says. In that case, you can simply wipe it off. Alternatively, a purse made of woven fabric can absorb more moisture. \u201cThe mould may be intertwined with the textile fibres, and will be difficult to clean.\u201d",

        "content": "Ron Johnson\u2019s statement about scrapping Affordable Care Act if GOP wins control of Congress seen as open goal for Democrats\nThe Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson said Republicans should try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they take back power \u2013 then retreated, under fire from the Biden administration.\nSpeaking to Breitbart News, a far-right site, on Monday, Johnson said Republicans could \u201cactually make good on what we established as our priorities\u201d if they won control of Congress in midterms this year and the presidency in 2024.\n\u201cFor example, if we\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2013 I still think we need to fix our healthcare system \u2013 we need to have the plan ahead of time so that once we get in office, we can implement it immediately, not knock around like we did last time and fail.\u201d\nWhen Republicans last controlled Congress and the White House, under Donald Trump, they failed to bring down the ACA. Popularly known as Obamacare, after the president who passed it, the law aims to provide affordable health insurance to those otherwise without it. It became law in 2010.\nThe ACA has increased in popularity since Biden took office. As of last year, approximately 31 million Americans received healthcare coverage through the ACA. An additional 1.2 million enrolled during a special six-month period during the Covid pandemic.\nThe Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has been reluctant to release details of what Republicans would do should they retake Congress in the midterms, with McConnell saying only an agenda will be revealed \u201cwhen we take it back\u201d.\nThe Florida senator Rick Scott produced an 11-point plan but McConnell opposed it in public. Scott\u2019s plan, Rescue America, includes building Trump\u2019s promised border wall, a declaration that there are only two genders, eliminating the Department of Education and requiring all Americans to pay some form of income tax.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re fortunate enough to have the majority next year, I\u2019ll be the majority leader,\u201d McConnell told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ll decide in consultation with my members what to put on the floor.\n\u201cLet me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda. We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets social security and Medicare within five years.\u201d\nIn his interview with Breitbart, Johnson said he supported parts of Scott\u2019s plan. But his comments on Obamacare gave Democrats something of an open goal, in terms of highlighting another Republican attack on a popular law.\nThe White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said: \u201cSenate Republicans have a plan to gut healthcare, raise premiums and strip protections for pre-existing conditions. They also want to raise taxes on half of Americans, including seniors and working families. Don\u2019t take my word for it, listen to [Senator Rick Scott] and [Senator Ron Johnson].\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Johnson released a statement about his comments.\n\u201cDuring the radio interview I used our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of how we need to be prepared to deliver on whatever agenda items we decide to run on,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI was not suggesting repealing and replacing Obamacare should be one of those priorities.\u201d\nJohnson said his focus was on fixing US healthcare and correcting Biden policies.",

It creates and amplifies risks all the way through the supply chain, from farm to warehouse to supermarket shelves,\u201d he said.\nBartos said food shortages had a knock on effect, resulting in increased produce prices and increasing the costs of insurance and lending.\nCEO of Farmers for Climate Action, Fiona Davis, called on governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as the most effective way to protect against the risks facing the food supply chain.\nThe report found increasing the diversity of supply chains, with multiple nodes and connections, would reduce some risk and that government investment in more numerous and diverse transport connections was vital.\nBut it warned inland rail, a flagship Coalition infrastructure project, may not be a panacea.\n\u201cSeveral organisations consulted for this project were concerned that inland rail could be disrupted by flooding at the same time as other road and rail links,\u201d the report found.\nIt also recommended shorter supply chains, able to respond quickly to shortages. This was demonstrated during the pandemic when local butchers and greengrocers, especially in rural towns, were able to maintain continuity of supply through their networks with producers.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nBartos said farmers and supply chain operators are already investing in improving their risk management, but even the best systems would eventually collapse in the face of the impacts of climate collapse.\n\u201cAdaptation is not sustainable if climate change continues unabated. Deep cuts to emissions are therefore required to protect food supply and food supply chains,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat the federal government action can do is to take what we already know is going to be a high risk and stop it from turning into an unmanageable risk.\u201d\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community",

The UK colour TV licence is \u00a3159.\nPoliticians on the left warned scrapping the licence fee would leave French public broadcasting at the whim of government budget decisions. The Socialist senator David Assouline tweeted that the implications would be \u201cserious\u201d for the independence of public media and amounted to \u201cdangerous demagoguery\u201d.\nThe Socialist presidential candidate Anne Hidalgo said scrapping the licence fee would \u201ckill\u201d the independence of public media, weaken public broadcasters in the face of growing private monopolies and \u201copen the door to privatisation\u201d. She said she would keep a licence fee but make it \u201cfairer\u201d.\nThe centrist senator Catherine Morin-Desailly complained that Macron had not waited for a major public report on the issue of state media funding, which is due to give its conclusions in June.\nThe government spokesperson Gabriel Attal sought to play down fears in an interview with the public radio station France Inter, saying: \u201cWe need a strong public media.\u201d He said the government would continue to guarantee state broadcasters\u2019 financing, independence and visibility in the long term. Macron did not expand on how public broadcasting would be funded.\nPresidential candidates on the right had already announced they intended to scrap the licence fee, including Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse who is running for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s party, Les R\u00e9publicains. The far-right Marine Le Pen has long said she wants to ditch the licence fee and privatise public television and radio in mainland France. The far-right former TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour has also vowed to scrap it and accused Macron of copying him. \u201cThe way he\u2019s copying my manifesto, he\u2019ll soon be suggesting ending immigration,\u201d Zemmour said on Twitter.\nChristophe Castaner, a close Macron ally and head of the parliamentary grouping of Macron\u2019s party, said there was a \u201chuge difference\u201d between Macron\u2019s proposals and those of Le Pen and Zemmour. \u201cThey both want to scrap public-service broadcasting,\u201d Castaner said, adding that Macron, by contrast, was \u201cvery attached to public-service broadcasting\u201d. But he said the licence fee \u201cis an unfair and archaic tax today\u201d.\nRoch-Olivier Maistre, the head of France\u2019s media watchdog, Arcom, said no candidate had yet detailed how to fund public service broadcasting without a licence fee. He said there must be a mechanism that allowed for \u201clong-term funding and stability\u201d as well as \u201cvisibility and independence\u201d.",

Emerald Fennell, who portrayed her in the Netflix series, was among those in attendance.\nThe Duchess of Cornwall and Fennell were seen to be in conversation for a few minutes, but when Fennell was asked about what the conversation involved, she said: \u201cYou know what \u2013 I\u2019m going to be very discreet, because if I\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s \u2018loose lips sink ships\u2019.\u201d\nThe Duchess of Cornwall\u2019s speech, which called on women to \u201cshare their stories\u201d in order to bring about a more equal world, addressed Fennell directly.\n\u201cIt is reassuring to know that, if I should fall off my perch at any moment, my fictional alter ego is here to take over,\u201d the Duchess said to laughter from the audience. \u201cSo, Emerald, be prepared!\u201d\nFennell said their meeting was \u201cabsolutely delightful\u201d.\n\u201cShe is such an impressive person, it was fittingly nice to meet her today on International Women\u2019s Day because she does so much for so many particularly female-centred charities,\u201d Fennell said. \u201cShe\u2019s been in the spotlight for a long time and has always weathered it with a lot of grace and good humour.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI was nervous I might be thrown in the tower but so far so good.\u201d\nThe event, which marked International Women\u2019s Day, also featured a moving speech by Inna Prystaiko, the wife of the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, in which she spoke about the experience of women during the invasion.\nWhile holding back tears, Prystaiko said: \u201cToday there are no smiles and no peace, just horror and sorrow in the eyes of every Ukrainian woman, mother and wife.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cNow we have to count the death toll of our people and watch their frightened, crying children who are forced to flee their native land with their mothers and sisters, leaving their fathers to defend our country.\u201d\nThe Crown has previously faced controversy regarding whether the show was historically accurate, with the former culture secretary Oliver Dowden urging the company to add a disclaimer that the show was fiction.

Two days before, he was arrested in Washington and accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church. Also charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, he was released the following day and ordered to stay out of the capital.\nAccording to the DoJ, Tarrio \u201cnonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021\u201d.\nHe later \u201cclaimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack,\u201d prosecutors said.\nFour other individuals have been charged: Ethan Nordean, 31, of Auburn, Washington; Joseph Biggs, 38, of Ormond Beach, Florida; Zachary Rehl, 36, of Philadelphia; Charles Donohoe, 34, of Kernersville, North Carolina; and Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, New York.\n\u201cThey earlier pleaded not guilty to charges,\u201d the DoJ said, referring to an indictment in December.\nTarrio\u2019s arrest followed charges of seditious conspiracy against 11 members of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia, which were announced in January.\nTarrio and the Proud Boys rose to prominence in support of Donald Trump and through violent confrontations with leftwing protesters.\nOn 6 January 2021, Trump supporters gathered in Washington DC to protest against Trump\u2019s election defeat by Joe Biden. Trump told them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d in service of his lie about electoral fraud. The Capitol was attacked. Seven people died around the riot and more than 100 police officers were hurt.\nMore than 770 people have been charged. The first jury trial arising from the attack, involving a Texas man who was a member of the Three Percenters rightwing group, reached jury deliberations on Tuesday.\nThe DoJ has faced intensifying pressure to more aggressively pursue those suspected of organizing and planning the Capitol attack. In a speech earlier this year, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, vowed to hold accountable all those responsible for the riot, whether or not they were present at the Capitol.\nIn its announcement on Tuesday, the DoJ said: \u201cFrom in or around December 2020, Tarrio and his co-defendants, all of whom were leaders or members of the Ministry of Self Defense [a Proud Boys group] conspired to corruptly obstruct, influence, and impede an official proceeding, the certification of the electoral college vote.\n\u201cOn 6 January, the defendants directed, mobilised and led members of the crowd on to the Capitol grounds and into the Capitol, leading to dismantling of metal barricades, destruction of property, and assaults on law enforcement.\n\u201cAlthough Tarrio is not accused of physically taking part in the breach of the Capitol, the indictment alleges that he led the advance planning and remained in contact with other members of the Proud Boys during their breach of the Capitol.\n\u201cThe indictment alleges that Tarrio nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021, and that he claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack.\u201d\nIn August last year, Tarrio was sentenced to five months in prison. He has also been revealed to have previously been an FBI informant.\nTarrio has denied organising violence on 6 January.

This parliament has issued, rightly so, formal apologies and pardons for the more recent historic injustices suffered by gay men and by miners.\n\u201cSecond, for some, this is not yet historic. There are parts of our world where even today, women and girls face persecution and sometimes death because they have been accused of witchcraft.\n\u201cAnd thirdly, fundamentally, while here in Scotland the Witchcraft Act may have been consigned to history a long time ago, the deep misogyny that motivated it has not. We live with that still. Today it expresses itself not in claims of witchcraft, but in everyday harassment, online rape threats and sexual violence.\u201d\nBREAKING NEWS The First @NicolaSturgeon just issued a formal apology to those people, mostly women, convicted under the Witchcraft Act on #InternationalWomensDay2022 .This is the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice @zoevenditozzi @madisonmitchel1\nModern misogyny, intensified by an increasingly polarised public discourse and amplified by social media, had a significant impact on women now questioning whether politics and public life are safe environments for them, Sturgeon added.\n  Sturgeon also welcomed in principle the recommendations made by Helena Kennedy\u2019s working group on misogynist abuse, published on Tuesday morning, stating her government would respond formally as soon as possible.\nShe added: \u201cThis report matters beyond the detail of the specific recommendations it makes. It matters because it acknowledges and it gives powerful voice to the stark realities of everyday life for women.\n\u201cIt recognises that misogyny is endemic, and that it blights the lives of women every single day.\u201d",

Labour suspended him from the party, pending an investigation.\nBercow, who has been banned from holding a parliamentary pass, called the investigation \u201camateurish\u201d and said he could circumvent any ban by being let in by a \u201cfriendly passholder\u201d.\nComplainants described Bercow\u2019s \u201camazing display of temper\u201d including an incident where he ordered a staff member to stay seated \u201cthen threw the mobile phone right in front of me on my desk and it burst into hundreds of bits and I could feel them hitting me\u201d.\nIn an excoriating verdict on Bercow\u2019s conduct during a decade as Speaker, the independent panel found his behaviour \u201cfell very far below that which the public has a right to expect from any member of parliament\u201d. It upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against him by former staff.\nIts sanction decision said: \u201cThe findings of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which we have upheld, show that the respondent has been a serial bully \u2026 His evidence in the investigations, the findings of the commissioner, and his submissions to us, show also that the respondent has been a serial liar.\u201d\nThe report said: \u201cThe respondent\u2019s conduct was so serious that, had he still been a member of parliament, we would have determined that he should be expelled by resolution of the house.\u201d\nIt described how Bercow had approached the investigation, including mimicking one complainant, Lord Lisvane, \u201con at least 20 occasions\u201d during the course of their conversation with an investigator.\nBercow said the complainants had been resisting his attempts to modernise parliament and said the inquiry been \u201ca protracted, amateurish and unjust process which would not have survived five minutes\u2019 scrutiny in court\u201d.\nBut Kate Emms, the former Speaker\u2019s secretary who made formal allegations against Bercow, said she had been \u201cvindicated\u201d and described how it had taken a toll on her life.\n\u201cThe impacts of the one and only genuinely horrible, undermining and consistently upsetting period of my career has spread into all areas of my life. Stress, anxiety and loss of confidence sent me home on sick leave and affected how I saw myself and how I felt I was seen by family, friends and colleagues.\u201d\nThe panel gave its findings after Bercow appealed against an initial report by Kathryn Stone, the standards commissioner.\nThe panel dismissed Bercow\u2019s appeals against those decisions, concluding in one case that he had \u201cbeen widely unreliable and repeatedly dishonest in his evidence\u201d.\nAs the Speaker, Bercow made a number of high-profile stands against the government\u2019s use of Brexit legislation, allowing a number of unorthodox challenges by MPs. But his final years in the role were dogged by allegations of bullying, including claims of swearing at officials and throwing his mobile phone.\nThe allegations were brought by Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, and the private secretaries Angus Sinclair and Emms.\nLeakey\u2019s complaint against Bercow was not upheld but he gave detailed testimony as a witness to other complainants. He told the Guardian: \u201cBercow has never ever said one word of contrition to anyone. He never put in place a process to deal with bullying when he had an opportunity to do so.\n\u201cIn my view, that disqualifies him from a role anywhere in public life or in any position of leadership or governance. He is uniquely disqualified.\u201d\nSeveral of the complainants kept detailed records of the abuse. Sinclair said he was berated and sworn at for answering a press inquiry on members\u2019 pay, noting that the Speaker called him \u201cfucking stupid\u201d.\nEmms made repeated complaints that Bercow had made personal attacks on her, belittled her in public, mimicked her and brought her to tears.\nLisvane also made multiple complaints about being belittled, backed by a senior MP who claimed Bercow would speak \u201cin a brutal and demeaning way, such as: \u2018You come here with your privileged background and offer your opinion, but I\u2019m not interested in your opinion.\u2019\u201d\nThe sub-panel of the independent experts chaired by Sir Stephen Irwin, a former court of appeal judge, found that parliament\u2019s bullying and harassment policy was \u201cbreached repeatedly and extensively by the most senior member of the House of Commons\u201d.\n\u201cHe has attempted to defeat these complaints by false accusations of collusion and by advancing lies,\u201d it said.\nBercow, a former Conservative MP, stepped down as Speaker and left the Commons in 2019. He was later denied a peerage despite being nominated by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Last year, he announced he had joined the Labour party.\nIn a lengthy response to the report, the former Speaker said: \u201cParliament is supposed to be the highest court in the land. This inquiry, which lasted a ghastly 22 months at great cost to the taxpayer, has failed it dismally. At the end of it, the panel has simply said that I should be denied a parliamentary pass, which I have never applied for and do not want. That is the absurdity of its position.\u201d",

Labour has since suspended him from the party. He is a professor of politics at Royal Holloway, and until last year was chancellor of the University of Essex. A spokesperson for Bercow said on Tuesday he had \u201cnever sought or wanted\u201d to be London mayor.\nThe independent panel that examined parliament\u2019s standards commissioner\u2019s findings concluded that at least 21 complaints against him could be upheld. It banned him from holding a parliamentary pass and said he could have been expelled from the Commons if still an MP.\nThe panel, chaired by the former appeal court judge Sir Stephen Irwin, said: \u201cThe findings of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which we have upheld, show that the respondent has been a serial bully. His evidence in the investigations, the findings of the commissioner, and his submissions to us, show also that the respondent has been a serial liar.\u201d\nComplainants described Bercow\u2019s \u201camazing display of temper\u201d, including claims of mimicking, shouting, swearing, public humiliation and smashing a mobile phone while throwing it at a senior staffer.\nBercow said the complaints were from staffers who had resisted his modernisation efforts. \u201cTo describe what I have experienced as a kangaroo court is grossly insulting to kangaroos,\u201d he said.\nLeakey said: \u201cPeople can redeem themselves and I hope John Bercow does redeem himself. But so far as I am aware, he has never ever said one word of contrition to anyone. He never put in place a process to deal with bullying when he had an opportunity to do so. In my view, that disqualifies him from a role anywhere in public life or in any position of leadership or governance. He is uniquely disqualified.\u201d\nLeakey\u2019s own complaint against Bercow was not upheld and he conceded there were no third party witnesses, but he gave detailed witness testimony of Bercow\u2019s bullying of other staff to the inquiry.\n\u201cI would never have taken him through the complaints procedure from my own personal point of view because I couldn\u2019t have cared less about his bullying to me personally,\u201d Leakey said. \u201cI had to think very carefully about doing it while I was Black Rod \u2013 it would have been written up as the Queen\u2019s representative taking on Bercow.\u201d\nHe said he had been aware of three people \u2013 Angus Sinclair, Kate Emms and Lord Lisvane \u2013 who had been treated far worse. Multiple complaints by the three were eventually upheld.\n\u201cI thought that I would make it very public that I was doing it to try and encourage others who had been bullied to do similar because otherwise he and people like him, was simply going to go on getting away with mistreating staff and other colleagues,\u201d he said.\nBercow said the process had been unfair, describing it as \u201cfeeble conclusions reached [that] would be torn to shreds in any judicial process\u201d.\nLeakey said the former Speaker could not complain about a system he had helped to enforce. \u201cHe will rail about how unfair or unjust it has been. But he was the Speaker in the House of Commons for 11 years,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe chaired the House of Commons commission. There were endless reports about bullying. If the process that is in place is a defective one in his view now, then he had 11 years of his own failure to put a proper process in place to blame for that.\u201d\n This article was amended on 9 March 2022 to clarify that John Bercow stood down last year as chancellor of the University of Essex.",

I remember standing at the top of the staircase overhearing my mum confront him, saying: \u2018If you die, your boys won\u2019t have a dad.\u2019 He never smoked again.\n\u201cThat kind of intervention is more powerful than most of us can imagine. Whether it\u2019s stopping drug addiction or dealing with depression, there\u2019s no more powerful motivating force than family.\u201d\nJavid said that although his father had died years later of colon cancer, he wondered \u201cif, by stopping smoking in his early 30s, it gave us much more time together as a family\u201d. Conversations with relatives could help people eat more healthily too, he said.\nIn a speech billed as the NHS\u2019s \u201croad to recovery\u201d after two years of the Covid pandemic Javid said that \u201cwe must choose between endlessly putting in more and more money or reforming how we do healthcare. I choose reform. I want us to shift to a new mode of operating, one that\u2019s about helping the whole population to stay healthy, not just treating those who show up asking for help.\u201d\nHe pointed out that while health spending accounted for 27% of public spending in 2000, that would increase to 44% by 2024 on current trends, which could not continue.\nPledging to make the NHS \u201cfit for the 21st century\u201d he outlined plans for an expansion of personal health budgets, much greater personalisation of care, closer integration between the NHS and social care, and easier access for patients to NHS care, including via the NHS app.\nBut Nigel Edwards, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, warned Javid that rising healthcare costs were a feature of western countries the UK was unlikely to avoid.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that cost pressures on the NHS are unsustainable,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cHow much of our wealth we choose to spend on healthcare is a matter of political choice. In developed countries across the world, governments are spending more on health services as the population ages and lives with more and more chronic conditions, and it is hard to see the UK bucking this trend any time soon.\u201d\nThe British Medical Association\u2019s chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said Javid had \u201comitted the most fundamental element of any recovery strategy, which is tackling the chronic workforce shortages in the NHS\u201d.\nJavid admitted that the long-term workforce plan that he had asked NHS England to draw up would take a year to appear, despite the urgency of the widespread staffing problems that were blighting every area of care and calls from NHS groups for quicker action.",

Strong winds are expected to cause more chaos in New South Wales today as the flooding crisis continues to affect Australia\u2019s east coast. Tens of thousands of residents across Sydney have been forced from their homes after the floods unleashed carnage and claimed the lives of a mother and son.\nFarther north, permanent residents in caravan parks have been devastated by flood water, and with many unable to afford insurance against increasingly common inundations, they have no option but to stay and rebuild. \u201cWe just get ourselves up, shake ourselves off, and start all over again,\u201d said resident Heather Emmett. State and federal MPs from both sides of politics have called for the planned commonwealth cyclone reinsurance scheme to be expanded to cover floods and fires. Now the clean-up has begun for many flood-affected communities, fears are being raised about the impact of the mountains of waste, with questions over a NSW government plan to store the rotting mounds at a quarry.\nRussia has been accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling the humanitarian corridor to the besieged city of Mariupol, as the number of people fleeing Ukraine passes 2 million. \u201cThe enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,\u201d the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook, adding that the Russian army \u201cdid not let children, women and elderly people leave the city\u201d. It\u2019s not the only incident of Russian soldiers targeting civilians, with multiple allegations of the use of deadly fire on civilian vehicles across Ukraine.\nThe price of fuel and food in Australia is set to rise, economists have warned, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely have unforeseen impacts on the Australian economy. Australia\u2019s relative dependence among rich nations on commodity exports leaves it exposed to sharp swings in international markets. More costly commodities would be noticed at Australians\u2019 kitchen tables and when they head to the service station, with prices predicted to jump to as much as $2.50 a litre for petrol.\nAnthony Albanese will use a speech at a business summit on Wednesday to bemoan a lost decade of division and policy inertia under the Coalition and present himself as a consensus figure with a \u201crenewal\u201d agenda.

        "content": "Analysis: Ukraine\u2019s president wants a no-fly zone but Britain could play a role securing alternatives\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s speech by video link to the European parliament last week was so powerful it brought the English translator to the verge of tears. \u201cProve you are with us,\u201d he said to leading EU politicians, a clear and emotive call for greater support that laid the ground for his speech Westminster on Tuesday.\nThe Russian invasion has already turned the khaki-wearing Ukrainian leader into the most powerful \u2013 and effective \u2013 political communicator in the world. The addresses from his office in Kyiv are designed to shift political and public opinion, and they have already had a dramatic impact.\nA private speech to EU leaders a few days earlier is credited with helping bring forward tougher than expected sanctions on Russia from Brussels. In that address he told the gathered presidents and prime ministers he believed his life was under threat, and from their relative safety in the Belgian capital the continent\u2019s leading politicians felt they had little choice but to step up.\nZelenskiy may have got his tough sanctions but they have not turned the tide in the war. Despite a chaotic and messy start, Russian forces continue to menace Kyiv and analysts at the Institute for the Study of War believe the start of attack on the capital could be 24 to 96 hours away.\nWhat the Ukrainians want immediately is greater military support from the west, as demonstrated by another speech from the president \u2013 a private video address made to 280 members of the US Congress on Saturday. One of those listening was Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who said Zelenskiy \u201cmade a desperate plea\u201d for the implementation of a no-fly zone \u2013 or failing that more fighter planes and other advanced military aid.\nBoris Johnson was in the Commons when Zelenskiy spoke. But he, in common with other Nato allies, has made clear he does not support a no-fly zone, partly because it is feared it could lead to a general war with Russia. \u201cWhen it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine, we have to accept the reality of that involves shooting down Russian planes,\u201d the UK prime minister said last week.\nIn the end, in a sober speech to a packed Commons, Zelenskiy pitched his request mildly, careful not to embarrass his hosts. The president complained that Nato hadn\u2019t given Ukraine \u201cthe result we were looking for\u201d by refusing to implement a no-fly zone and pleaded \u201cfind a way to make our Ukrainian sky safe\u201d.\nOn Saturday, Zelenskiy had pivoted from asking for a no-fly zone towards an alternative demand for greater military aid. That would start with a call for Poland and other eastern European countries to supply Russian-made fighter jets of the type Ukraine\u2019s pilots know how to fly.\nBritain\u2019s role here would be both to help persuade eastern European countries to part with their MiG-29s or similar and help provide replacement air support, and other more capable arms, such as air defence systems \u2013 all likely to be needed in the defence of Kyiv.\nThe risk for Britain and the west is that greater rearmament will further provoke Russia, but facing a national existential crisis, Zelenskiy has no time to worry about that. The president did not have to spell out what he felt his country needed: the hint was clear enough \u2013 Ukraine was \u201cdefending freedom, despite the blows of one of the world\u2019s largest armies\u201d and an \u201copen sky, still open to Russian missiles, planes, helicopters\u201d.",

        "content": "Independent Canadian investigators call for reinvestigation of 14 deaths of Indigenous people in northern Ontario\nA group of independent investigators have called for the reinvestigation of the sudden deaths of 14 Indigenous people in a north Ontario city, after finding that the original inquiries were hampered by sloppy police work and a legacy of institutional racism.\nThe team have examined hundreds of deaths between 2003 and 2017 in Thunder Bay, the largest city in the northern reaches of the province \u2013 and one where the police force has long faced allegations of racism within its ranks.\nIn 2016, one of the largest inquests in Ontario history concluded that Indigenous people in the region were overpoliced but crimes against them were underinvestigated.\nTwo years later, a landmark report by Murray Sinclair \u2013 a former senator and one of the country\u2019s first Indigenous judges \u2013 found significant flaws in investigations into the deaths of nine Indigenous people, as well as a \u201cclear and indisputable pattern\u201d of racism in the Thunder Bay police force. Following Sinclair\u2019s report, the city\u2019s police board was dissolved.\nAs part of that report, a team of independent investigators was assembled to scour additional historical cases.\nLast week, the investigative team submitted its findings to Ontario\u2019s ministry of the attorney general and the office of the independent police review director.\nThe report has not yet been made public, but the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) and the Globe and Mail were able to view the report ahead of its public release.\nOf the 14 sudden deaths highlighted in an upcoming report, 10 were women and the ages ranged from two months old to 61 years old.\nIn the cases flagged by the investigative team, documentation was often missing or incomplete. Police investigations were inconsistent and deviated from standards. The investigative team also found cases where coroners failed to attend the scene of a death or even order a postmortem to determine a cause of death.\nThe report determined that pathologists and police were \u201cmaking premature comments on no foul play and releasing scenes\u201d before a postmortem exam could be done in cases of suspicious deaths.\nIn one case from 2010, a 42-year-old woman was found dead from a possible hanging. Police failed to interview any possible witnesses or obtain video from the hotel where she was staying with her boyfriend. It was later determined the boyfriend had previous convictions for multiple assaults. He was never interrogated by police before he died in 2017.\nIn another case, a two-month-old baby boy was found unresponsive in an apartment and pronounced dead at a hospital. The report found that police were aware of previous abuse allegations against the parents involving another child in the home. Investigators said the cause and manner of death of the two-month-old was undetermined, but if evidence had been properly collected, the death would probably have been investigated as possible criminal negligence causing death.\nA second report, which will not be made public, identified 25 unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. The investigative team has called for external review of those cases.",

Harrington, a lobbyist and businessman who was previously minister for Syrian refugees and stepped down as an MP in 2019, will be made a life peer sitting in the House of Lords.\nHis appointment comes as 45 charities including Oxfam, Save The Children and the Refugee Council have sent a letter to the Guardian claiming the government\u2019s \u201cchaotic, heartless and unkind\u201d polices send a clear message to Ukrainians that they are not welcome in the UK.\nThe backlash from MPs came in the Commons after it was revealed that the UK has so far issued 500 visas to Ukrainian nationals seeking sanctuary.\nThe EU has warned that as many as five million could flee to the bloc if Russia\u2019s invasion continued amid demands from MPs and lawyers for ministers to relax or streamline visa rules.\nMinisters have continued to resist visa waivers or allowing Ukrainians to apply once they have arrived in the UK, claiming there is a security risk that Russian agents could enter the UK.\nAt a Commons session that Patel did not attend, Sir Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, claimed the home secretary had misled the House on Monday by claiming that a visa application centre had been set up for Ukrainians in Calais.\nHe said: \u201cIn response to my question yesterday, the home secretary said: \u2018I have already made it clear in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en route to Calais that we have staff in Calais.\u2019\n\u201cThat was untrue and under any normal administration that in itself would be a resignation [matter].\u201d\nOn Monday afternoon, there were still signs in Calais telling refugees to go to centres in Paris or Brussels.\nThe Home Office minister Kevin Foster replied indicating that Patel had on Monday also said that a new processing centre for visas would soon be set up.\n\u201cI understand the home secretary clarified her remarks yesterday. There is a reason why we believe it is right that key security checks are done before people arrive here in the UK,\u201d he said.\nMPs told ministers that they had received letters from constituents requesting help bringing loved ones from Ukraine and offers of charity for Ukrainian people because the Home Office appeared unable to help.\nConservative former immigration minister Mark Harper said the government needs to \u201cgrip the pace of this\u201d while Andrew Murrison, another ex-Tory minister, asked why the Republic of Ireland has welcomed more than 2,000 refugees from Ukraine but the UK has \u201ccome nowhere even close to that\u201d.\nAlec Shelbrooke, the Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell, demanded the Home Office \u201cget a grip\u201d on processing visa applications for Ukrainian refugees.\n\u201cDoes the Home Office recognise that this is a war of the likes that has not been seen for 80 years in Europe? We don\u2019t want to stand in this house and listen to plans and processes, we want dates, we want action \u2026 This is a disgrace,\u201d he said.\nThe Conservative MP Julian Sturdy said his York Outer constituents were ready and willing to offer help, adding: \u201cThe only barrier to their support seems to be Home Office bureaucracy.\u201d\nJason McCartney highlighted the \u201cvibrant\u201d Ukrainian community in his Colne Valley constituency. \u201cWe\u2019ve done so much on sanctions, on humanitarian aid and on military aid so why are we dragging our feet with all this bureaucracy?\u201d the MP said.\nThe Home Office is currently trying to expand its operations in cities near the Ukrainian border to process applicants. Hundreds of people seeking help are already in Calais but have been asked to apply from Paris or Brussels.\nThe department is understood to have accepted dozens of staff from HMRC to help with the current crisis and is training more people to deal with visa applications.\nBy Wednesday, the Home Office plans to have opened a new office in Lille, 75 miles away from Calais, which can process visa applications from Ukrainians who have travelled to the port. It is also examining funding a travel service from Calais to Lille.\nHarrington will report jointly to Michael Gove\u2019s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office.\nLast year, he was reprimanded by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments after taking up a role as the chair of the public affairs firm APCO UK without seeking prior permission from the \u201crevolving door\u201d watchdog.\nHe also set up the Conservatives\u2019 \u2018No 10 club\u2019, where mid-range Tory donors socialised with senior politicians in exchange for a \u00a310,000 annual membership.\nIn their letter to the Guardian, the charities said the government shows a \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for the UN Convention on Refugees.\n\u201cBy setting up a limited and restricted family scheme [for Ukrainians] and making a vague promise to establish some kind of humanitarian sponsorship programme, its [the government\u2019s] response looks chaotic, heartless and unkind.\n\u201cAt the same time, it is pushing ahead with its cruel nationality and borders bill that will undermine the right to refugee protection and criminalise Ukrainians, Afghans and others who, through no fault of their own, are forced to make their own way to safety.\n\u201cIt seems the government has chosen to send a clear message to refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere that they are not welcome,\u201d the letter reads.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Ukraine. We are doing everything possible to ensure a rapid visa service for those eligible to the Ukraine Family Scheme while carrying out vital security checks.\u201d",

        "content": "A digital runway aims to elevate Australian-made fashion \u2013 but also reveals the shortfalls in Australia\u2019s manufacturing capability\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the Cranbourne Royal Botanical Gardens will ever see anything like it again: a group of models, wearing designer clothes, wander its beautifully crafted Australian Garden. Clad in suits and gowns, many walk barefoot through water features and across grey concrete.\nThe models are here to shoot a digital runway, a partnership between Australian Made and the Melbourne fashion festival. Every garment featured in the film is made in Australia and licensed to carry the Australian Made logo: the familiar green triangle with its yellow kangaroo.\nThe runway is pitched to elevate Australian designers in the global market and, when it launches on 9 March, consumers in the United Kingdom and America will be able to shop from it. But sourcing product for the film revealed limitations in Australia\u2019s manufacturing capacity. For instance, the footwear \u2013 or lack thereof.\nThe film\u2019s stylist, Emily Ward, describes finding shoes that met the Australian Made requirements as challenging. \u201cI sort of went down the line exploring some brands \u2026 and then we realised they weren\u2019t actually made here, so we had to move on.\u201d\nShe settled on two brands who make their products locally, Nelson Made and Alias Mae. But even then, certain styles did not meet Australian Made requirements.\nTo use the Australian Made logo, an item has to meet the test of \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d. According to Ben Lazzarro, the company\u2019s chief executive, this means \u201cyou\u2019ve got to cut and sew here\u201d.\nIf you take the example of a shirt, he says, \u201cas long as you cut that material here, sew and form it into a shirt here, you can legally make a \u2018made in Australia\u2019 claim,\u201d even if the fabric has been imported.\nThe reason it was harder for Ward to find shoes is because often the leather for footwear is imported pre-cut. The shoes she did source for the runway were from designers, \u201chandcrafting shoes on a smaller scale, who aren\u2019t in the mass market\u201d.\n\u201cR.M. Williams used to be made locally in Australia,\u201d she says, as did other more established brands. But \u201cthey\u2019re not 100% Australian Made any more\u201d, though last year the owners of R.M. Williams suggested they may return to 100% local manufacturing.\nThe runway featured nine Australian labels, including Bianca Spender and Viktoria and Woods, two brands that have manufactured locally since their inception. Margie Woods, the creative director of Viktoria and Woods, described the campaign as \u201ca really important, positive step\u201d for brands that do make the effort to manufacture here. \u201cIt is a lot easier to go offshore.\u201d\nWoods describes the challenges of making in Australia as multifaceted. She says the most common is the cost of labor; another is \u201cquite a big skills shortage here\u201d. Finally, the lack of machinery and advanced technology means certain categories like outerwear, denim, leather and complicated knitwear are particularly difficult to make locally.\nWoods recently invested $130,000 in a knitting machine to support one of her makers. She says the purchase, which is sizeable for an independent designer, \u201cwill allow us to produce 4,000 more garments in Australia per year\u201d.\nMary Lou Ryan, the co-founder of Bassike \u2013 another brand committed to local manufacturing \u2013 says Australia has fallen behind. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t really been a) the infrastructure and government support and b) \u2026 the support from Australian brands to get behind the industry either.\u201d\nRyan suggests government funding for technology and automated machinery, bringing back skills through tertiary education and trade programs and more support for immigration could help Australia catch up.\nSubsidies, skilled migration visas and technological investment are suggestions echoed by Woods, who says \u201cfrom a government level something can be done \u2026 to keep local manufacturing alive\u201d.\nAustralian brands, meanwhile, need to deliver commitment and continuity, Ryan says. If brands come in and try it for six months, \u201cthen find it\u2019s too hard and go back offshore \u2026 things won\u2019t move ahead\u201d.\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\nBianca Spender says designers need to be conscious of the fragility of manufacturing businesses. \u201cDesigners can devastate manufacturers,\u201d she says. Things like delayed payments, asking for lots of work on season then nothing the next and a lack of commitment \u201ccan leave them out of pocket very quickly\u201d.\nLazzarro is aware of the manufacturing issues the fashion industry faces, but he explains it is not the role of Australian Made to get involved. \u201cWe\u2019re not a lobby or advocacy group,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re a licensing and a marketing group\u201d.\nThe Australian Fashion Council (AFC) has taken a different approach. In 2020, they approached the then minister for industry, science and technology, Karen Andrews, and requested support to increase demand for all Australian fashion, regardless of whether or not it was produced here.\nLeila Naja Hibri, the chief executive of the AFC, says \u201cif we only look at manufacturing and making, you\u2019re really regressing because we\u2019re not thinking of the soft skills. Australians are amazing at design and product development.\n\u201cWe absolutely want Australian products to be made here,\u201d she says. But since most of the industry is making offshore, she believes the path to healthy local manufacturing runs through championing all Australian fashion businesses.\nThe result of this lobbying was a grant of $1m from the Department of Industry Science, Energy and Resources to create an Australian fashion certified trademark that can be licensed by brands. The mark is set to be launched at the end of March, and has different criteria to Australian Made\u2019s \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d requirement.\nAccording to Naja Hibri, it will look at things like ownership, whether most of a brand\u2019s workforce is in Australia, and whether the brand pays taxes here.\nNaja Hibri says that only increasing demand for Australian fashion more broadly will \u201cgive brands the fiscal headspace to be able to expand.\u201d At which point, they can \u201cwork on projects to skill workers, hire the right people and manufacture locally\u201d.",

In a recent regulatory filing, McDonald\u2019s said its restaurants in Russia and Ukraine contributed 9% of its annual revenue, or around $2bn.\nThe company \u2013 which opened its first Russian branch in Pushkin Square in Moscow on 31 January 1990, when an estimated 38,000 Soviets lined up for hours to taste the Big Mac, a symbol of American capitalism \u2013 said it will continue to pay its 62,000 Russia-based employees.\nIn a message to staff and franchisees, Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive of McDonald\u2019s, said the situation was \u201cextraordinarily challenging for a global brand like ours\u201d, which he said worked with hundreds of local suppliers and partners producing its food. \u201cWe understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe conflict in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Europe has caused unspeakable suffering to innocent people. As a system, we join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace,\u201d Kempckinski added.\nStarbucks, too, said it is suspending all business activity in Russia, including shipment of its products and cafes run by a licensee.\nThe company said that Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which operates at least 100 Starbucks cafes, would still support its nearly 2,000 staff in Russia \u201cwho depend on Starbucks for their livelihood\u201d.\nMcDonald\u2019s and other western food and drink companies have faced calls to pull out of Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.\nCoca-Cola Co later said it was suspending its business in Russia. Pepsi also followed suit, saying the sale of its brands, capital investments and all advertising would be suspended in Russia and it would support \u201cour 20,000 Russian associates and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain\u201d. It said it would continue to sell daily essentials, such as milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food, in Russia.\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told CNN two days ago that \u201call western companies must withdraw from Russia\u201d on humanitarian grounds. \u201cWe were upset to hear companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s remain in Russia and continue providing their products,\u201d he said.\nMcDonald\u2019s said it could not predict when it may be able to reopen its restaurants in Russia and would \u201ccontinue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required\u201d. It said it would \u201cclosely monitor the humanitarian situation\u201d as well as disruption to its supply chain.\nMcDonald\u2019s is also paying full salaries to its Ukrainian employees and has donated $5m (\u00a33.8m) to an assistance fund for employees as well as supporting relief efforts led by the International Red Cross.\nThe McDonald\u2019s shutdown comes after a host of other consumer brands including Netflix, Levi\u2019s, Burberry, Ikea and Unilever, the owner of Marmite and Ben & Jerry\u2019s, announced they had halted business in the country.\nLeading professional services firms including KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte have also cut off businesses in Russia and Belarus.\nCompanies around the world have been scrambling to assess their links with Russia after the US, EU and UK sought to isolate it economically with sanctions.\nSanctions have also made it illegal for US, EU or UK companies to serve some of the biggest Russian businesses, including banks such as Sberbank, Gazprombank and VTB.",

Potential panelists wound up completing questionnaires hours later.\nDavid said that as he was completing his questionnaire, he heard \u201cpapers being ripped off the questionnaire packets\u201d and people asking questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super distracting,\u201d he said, saying he just skimmed the paperwork in front of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t spend a whole lot of time thinking about it.\u201d\nDavid also said: \u201cWe just sat there for three hours. I didn\u2019t have a phone, I didn\u2019t have a book. I was sitting there, twiddling my thumbs, thinking about the breakup that just happened a few weeks prior and sitting in my feelings and not very focused.\u201d\nNathan asked David if he took her instructions seriously when he returned to court several weeks later for further questioning. When he said yes, the judge asked him to explain why.\n\u201cBecause it was a different situation. I wasn\u2019t distracted. There weren\u2019t things going on. I wasn\u2019t sitting there for hours. It was multiple weeks later,\u201d David said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t distracted.\u201d\n\u201cAt that point, I wasn\u2019t thinking about my ex.\u201d\nHe also said: \u201cI didn\u2019t lie in order to get on this jury and then go to the press and tell them about my abuse.\n\u201cIf I lied deliberately, I wouldn\u2019t have told a soul.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt was an honest mistake and one of the biggest mistakes, and again, I apologize for wasting a lot of people\u2019s time and money, and this is never anything that I intended or did on purpose.\u201d\nMaxwell was convicted on 29 December on sex-trafficking and related charges for procuring girls \u2013 some aged just 14 \u2013 for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell has maintained her innocence.\nEpstein, a convicted sex offender who once counted elite figures such as Prince Andrew among his associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking. He killed himself in a New York federal jail about a month after his arrest.\nMaxwell\u2019s conviction was thrown into potential disarray just days after her trial concluded. David claimed in media interviews he had been sexually abused as a child and said that he told other jurors about this abuse, which helped them see things from a victim\u2019s perspective.\nThe comments prompted controversy because potential jurors were directly asked about past abuse. One question stated: \u201cHave you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault?\u201d\nFollowing David\u2019s comments in the media, prosecutors asked Nathan for an inquiry. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers quickly joined in, and have been pushing for a mistrial, arguing that David\u2019s failure to disclose past abuse deprived Maxwell of a fair and impartial jury.\nDavid\u2019s completed questionnaire was released during legal exchanges. It revealed that he marked the no box in response to the abuse question. In court on Tuesday, Nathan asked if that was an accurate answer.\n\u201cNo it is not,\u201d David said.\n\u201cWhat is an accurate answer to that question?\u201d the judge asked.\nDavid alleged that his former stepbrother and a friend sexually abused him when he was nine and 10, on multiple occasions. David said he told his mother when he was in high school, and that she went to police but no charges resulted.\nDavid said he had not considered himself a victim of crime when completing the questionnaire, saying this mentality is \u201cpart of my healing process\u201d. He answered no on a question about whether a family member had been accused of abuse.\nNathan said he had accused his former stepbrother of abuse. David said he did not consider him family. At several points during Nathan\u2019s questioning, David said his experience did not affect his ability to be a fair juror in Maxwell\u2019s case.\nWhile it is unlikely Maxwell will be retried, it is a possibility. Veteran attorneys told the Guardian that would hinge on David\u2019s explanation for his failure to disclose.\nAn accidental omission poses less of a potential for retrial. However, if David intentionally withheld that information, the possibility is higher.\nFollowing David\u2019s testimony, Nathan asked both sides to submit paperwork. She will rule at a later date.",

She is also a former minister for sport and tourism.\nThe Guardian spoke to Grant in the ticket hall of Lviv station on Saturday as he waited to board a train for Kyiv.\nHe said: \u201cI haven\u2019t been sent, nothing to do with the government, nothing to do with my mother. Just wanna make that clear, completely off my own back, I decided to do this. I didn\u2019t even tell my mum, but it is what it is.\u201d\nGrant said he chose to head for Ukraine after seeing footage of Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said: \u201cI thought, I am a father of three, and if that was my kids I know what I would do, I would go and fight. Then I thought I would want another load of people who might be skilled enough to help me come and help me, come and help me, save my family.\u201d\nGrant said he expects scores more ex-servicemen to join from the UK. He said: \u201cIn total we have another 100 people coming, so this will be really good when they all get here \u2013 different backgrounds, some of them are very, very specialist.\u201d\nLast week the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was criticised after saying she would back Britons going to Ukraine to fight Russia. And on Sunday the chief of the defence staff, Tony Radakin, urged the public not to head to Ukraine. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that it\u2019s unlawful as well as unhelpful for UK military and for the UK population to start going towards Ukraine.\u201d\nThe risk for foreign fighters in Ukraine was underlined last week when Russia threatened to bring \u201ccriminal\u201d prosecution against them.\nRussian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said: \u201cNone of the mercenaries the West is sending to Ukraine to fight for the nationalist regime in Kyiv can be considered as combatants in accordance with international humanitarian law or enjoy the status of prisoners of war.\u201d\nGrant said he knows that Russia army is not sticking to the Geneva convention and is shooting journalists and civilians. He said he would rather take his own life than be taken prisoner. He said: \u201cIf it comes to me being able to end my life before getting captured, I probably would do that. I mentally prepared myself for that, but let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cYes, I am scared but I know it\u2019s the right thing, pretty easy decision to make.\u201d\nAsked about joining the Ukrainian army he said: \u201cThey are strong, they don\u2019t look frightened, they look ready. Will be great to be part of a team that looks ready. They look great, they got fires in their bellies, I want to be part of that to help.\u201d\nGrant also told Reuters that he would wait to see how he and his comrades would be deployed. \u201cWho knows, maybe an independent unit is what gets formed,\u201d he said as Ukrainians thanked him for coming.\nGrant, who has been working as a security contractor in Iraq, described how he broke the news to his family. He said: \u201cI was over in Iraq and was there for few months and then flew home, saw my missus and kids, hadn\u2019t seen them for a while, and basically said: \u2018I\u2019m going to Ukraine.\u2019 So big shock, I feel a bit sorry for them to be fair \u2026 they were pretty upset, but people need me here.\u201d\nOne of Grant\u2019s comrades, who identified himself only as Ash from London, said he wanted to go to Ukraine after seeing a video of a plane firing a missile at a family\u2019s home.\nAnother gave his name as Jax, and like Grant said he had worked in private security in Iraq. He said: \u201cI left \u00a34,500 a month to come here.\u201d\nJax said his family was supportive, and said they know that once he made up his mind, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be budged\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019ll stay to the bitter end, even if I\u2019ll take a bullet to the chest.\u201d\nHelen Grant has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "England are still hoping Tom Curry and Alex Dombrandt will be available to face Ireland after both forwards were included in a 26-man squad for Saturday\u2019s penultimate Six Nations weekend. Wasps\u2019 uncapped forward Alfie Barbeary, though, has been retained as cover with his clubmate Joe Launchbury poised for his first matchday involvement in this year\u2019s tournament at the expense of Saracens\u2019 Nick Isiekwe.\nCurry came off at half-time against Wales after failing a head injury assessment while Dombrandt has been in isolation since testing positive for Covid-19 last Friday. The absence of the fit-again Sam Underhill suggests England remain optimistic about Curry\u2019s prognosis, with Exeter\u2019s Sam Simmonds on hand to join the starting back row if Dombrandt cannot train on Thursday.\nIt is more than possible England will field a mere four starting survivors from last year\u2019s 32-18 defeat in Dublin when Ireland took a firm early grip and never let go. With the Vunipola brothers dropped, Mark Wilson having retired and injury having sidelined five others, it may be that only Curry, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje and Charlie Ewels kick off both games.\nThe hosts are already braced for a seriously physical encounter amid suggestions Twickenham could witness a \u201cbar-room brawl\u201d on Saturday. The former Ireland coach Eddie O\u2019Sullivan believes the home side will be wanting to make a no-nonsense statement and England\u2019s prop Joe Marler also anticipates a \u201cding-dong\u201d contest this weekend.\nScotland will complete their Guinness Six Nations campaign without Duhan van der Merwe [pictured].\nThe 26-year-old has been hit with a three-week ban after he was sent off for reckless or dangerous play during Worcester's defeat at London Irish in the Premiership on Saturday. He will be unavailable for Gregor Townsend's side's remaining games against Italy and Ireland.\n\"[Van der Merwe] accepted that foul play occurred but questioned whether the red card threshold had been met,\" read a statement. \"The panel upheld the red card and Van der Merwe received a three-week ban, however, subject to completing the World Rugby Coaching Intervention programme he will be free again to play against Gloucester on 25 March.\"\nO\u2019Sullivan\u2019s view is that England are potentially dangerous opponents because they will be desperate not to finish in the championship\u2019s bottom half for a second consecutive season. \u201cIf they lose their last two Six Nations games it will be very difficult,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan told BBC Radio Ulster. \u201cThey need a result and for that reason they are very dangerous. This will be a bar-room brawl and we need to be ready for it.\u201d\nMarler, England\u2019s most seasoned forward, does not disagree with him. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a fair assumption. A nice, clean bar brawl, though, none of the dirty stuff. No gouging or glass-throwing, just the clean stuff. They are very aggressive at the breakdown and love chucking numbers in there. So it is going to be a ding-dong.\u201d\nFor that reason, according to the 31-year-old Marler, there has been an extra edge to England training in Bagshot with Eddie Jones\u2019s side facing daunting fixtures against Ireland and France on successive weekends. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bigger sense of \u2018OK, Ireland are very good\u2019. With the greatest respect Wales were missing a fair few names. There was probably a little more expectation on us to win that game whereas Ireland are full bore and have been together for some time now. It was definitely noticeable in training.\u201d\nMarler, though, also says he can barely recall England not being the favourites to win at home, as Jones has been suggesting this week. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt like an underdog at Twickenham \u2026 maybe against New Zealand once. [But] we know how good they are so we have to be right on the money. We\u2019ll have to be sugar-hot in order to get the win. Most games are won by the most physically dominant team. We\u2019ll need to win that battle in order to put them under enough pressure to give us time to put our game on the park.\u201d The Six Nations, meanwhile, is to stage an inaugural Under-18 women\u2019s tournament in Edinburgh next month.",

        "content": "As one of the last western media journalists covering Myanmar I knew danger lurked \u2013 and there would be no James Bond to get me out\nOne hot morning last March I walked into Yangon\u2019s St Mary\u2019s Cathedral as the best man at a wedding. The European-Burmese couple had made a swift decision to tie the knot due to uncertainty about foreign marriage rules under Myanmar\u2019s new military regime that had seized power just weeks earlier. They were also mulling plans to get out of the country as the army embarked on a shoot to kill offensive against peaceful protesters.\nBeing a journalist chasing deadlines into the small hours, I complained about the early morning start to the wedding. \u201cWe want to wrap up the ceremony before we start to hear shooting,\u201d the groom explained. A few pairs of slippers near the altar caught my attention \u2013 if soldiers raided the church the women could change out of their high heels and run, the bride told me. Her mother grimly added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I will make it [if soldiers break in], but hopefully my daughters can.\u201d The risk was real as some religious buildings had provided cover for protesters.\nOpposite the neo-gothic cathedral stood the old and empty offices of the Myanmar Times, formerly the nation\u2019s only private English-language daily. Operations halted a few weeks after the 1 February 2021 coup as staff resigned and readers boycotted the newspaper over its proprietor\u2019s editorial policies, seen as sympathetic to the regime.\nOther media outlets also disappeared, some returning into exile in Thailand or operating underground, as Myanmar ended a decade of relative press freedom. By coincidence I had moved to the independent Frontier Myanmar on the day of the coup. \u201cYou\u2019ve jinxed us all,\u201d a colleague joked by phone as the junta cut off mobile and internet networks.\nDays after the coup I relocated to a hotel beside Yangon\u2019s Kandawgyi Lake and relied on its military-owned wifi network to circumvent restrictions and keep reporting. I covered protests until the bullets rained down, and afterwards stayed in touch with activists, politicians, diplomats and businesspeople. Some of my Burmese colleagues took refuge in border jungle areas. From my room I could see the gilded Shwedagon, the most revered pagoda in Myanmar, under the moonlight as the city was put under a night-time curfew. The hotel bar thankfully stayed open. One foreigner after another held drunken goodbye gatherings around a pool lined with palm trees as the military carried out house-to-house arrests outside.\nYangon turned from one of the safest cities in Asia to its most violent. An employee of the South Korean bank Shinhan was fatally shot in the company van. Bombs exploded across the country, including near my hotel. Over the past year an estimated 1,500-plus people have been killed by the regime. \u201cYou should read A Gentleman in Moscow,\u201d an international non-governmental organisation leader told me over drinks, referring to the story of Count Alexander Rostov, who is ordered to live out the rest of his life under house arrest in the Russian capital\u2019s Metropol hotel.\nI am no Rostov. In late July I returned to my apartment in the outskirts of Yangon amid Covid-19\u2019s third wave and spent the rest of the year splitting my accommodation among various places. Carrying a jute tote bag from Marks & Spencer, my disguise as an innocent Hong Kong businessman paid off when soldiers stopped and searched my taxis. For months, risks of mobile phone searches and criminalisation of free speech made me leave my iPhone behind when going out.\nActivists, employees and even investors were eager to share \u2013 usually via encrypted channels \u2013 leaked information, and their own emotions and pleas to the world. But on the ground there was a genuine sense of despair and despondency, and of betrayal. As friends and colleagues lost loved ones and as Yangon residents remained defiant by the show of citywide strikes as recently as last month, the world has not offered much support beyond statements and words.\nMany businesspeople who spent the last decade courting the reformist administrations of Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi have had no problem shaking hands with the new autocratic regime. Chambers of commerce from China, India, South Korea and Malaysia greeted the regime without a fuss. Comparisons with South Africa\u2019s apartheid era came to mind.\nThe generals responded to the public\u2019s mass opposition with sheer brutality. Entire villages were burnt or terrorised for supporting the resistance. They tried to control internet access, and considered developing their own digital currency while drafting a cybersecurity law to criminalise online gambling and VPN use.\nReminiscent of North Korea, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing opened an underpass and inspected chicken and duck farms during the various crises. The coup leader expressed ambitions for Myanmar to make electric cars, domestic vaccines and an underground metro in the deserted capital Naypyidaw amid growing power outages and economic collapse.\nBeside Yangon\u2019s beautiful Inya Lake I hosted an end-of-year garden party to thank readers and contacts. Diplomats and investors were among those gathering to chat and take stock of a tumultuous year. The sun painted the city sky golden red. Scotch eggs, lobster bisque, welsh rarebit were served. Life in the commercial capital went on \u2013 for some.\nBut there was a constant sense of danger lurking for journalists. If the regime threw me behind bars, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a James Bond to get you out\u201d, one ambassador warned. The junta has killed at least three Burmese journalists since December; my US colleague Danny Fenster spent six months in Insein prison. I was one of the last foreign correspondents for western media outlets left in the country. Feeling the strain after nearly a year of covering the coup and sensing I had ridden my luck as long as possible, I decided to quit. Escorted by diplomats inside the airport, I paid my visa overstay fees and rushed to my plane.\nMany in Myanmar, however, are refusing to give up: journalists work in hiding, young people and formerly peaceful activists have joined new resistance forces in the jungles and ethnic communities have stepped up their decades-long struggles. The regime is inflicting heavy losses \u2013 but also incurring its own.\nThompson Chau is editor-at-large of Burmese media outlet Frontier Myanmar and covers Myanmar for the Economist.

Without the rule changes there is not enough time before the federal election in May to hold branch preselections.\nAfter at least eight attempts at resolving the impasse at state level, it now seems inevitable that the federal executive will take over the process from the troubled branch. Some in the party believe this has been a deliberate strategy by the prime minister\u2019s representative, Alex Hawke, who has delayed the vetting process for candidates by being unavailable until very recently.\nThe only progress made after Wednesday\u2019s vote was a decision to endorse cardiologist, Michael Feneley in the Central Coast seat of Dobell, the sole person to nominate for the Liberals.\nIn Warringah, where there is also only person left standing, the state executive refused to endorse Lincoln Parker. Instead it will reopen nominations for a third time.\nThere is also no resolution in the seat of Hughes, where the Right faction has been seeking to install Alex Dore, a former Young Liberal president, who lives outside the seat, to replace maverick MP Craig Kelly.\nThe proposal to install Dore, who is also the nephew of the Australian newspaper\u2019s editor in chief Chris Dore, has infuriated local Liberals. There are three other local people who have nominated, including the state MP for Holsworthy, Melanie Gibbons.\nThe latest failure to resolve the situation reveals the deep divisions within the NSW Liberal party.\nSome members strongly support implementing what are known as the Warringah rules, which were championed by former prime minister, Tony Abbott, and embedded in the NSW division\u2019s constitution in 2017. They call for much greater involvement of party members in selecting candidates through branch plebiscites.\nBut factional powerbrokers and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, want a much greater say in who becomes a federal member, arguing that electoral success requires the right person for the seat.\nBut the state executive has been unable to agree on this approach either.\nSeveral earlier proposals for the state executive to step in and install candidates across winnable seats according to a deal drawn up between factional organisers failed to win support and helped spark a legal challenge in the NSW supreme court in the past fortnight.\nSome of the steam was taken out of the preselection issue last week after the federal executive of the party took over the NSW division for 72 hours and installed the three sitting members who were under threat from challenges.\nSussan Ley, the environment minister, has been endorsed as the Liberal party candidate for Farrer, immigration minister Alex Hawke has been endorsed as candidate for Mitchell and Trent Zimmerman, a key figure in the moderates, is the candidate for North Sydney.\nThis had been one of Morrison\u2019s key demands.\nThe division has now returned to the control of the NSW state executive, which has until 25 March to complete the candidate selection process.\nBut intervention could come earlier.\nWith the federal election just weeks away, local Liberals are furious at not having candidates in the field to campaign against the ALP and independents who are running on platforms of strong local representation and climate change.\nHowever, more federal intervention raises the prospect of further legal challenges.",

Detective superintendent Peter Read, who is in charge of the investigation, said the images had been reviewed by pathologists who confirmed two sets of remains.\nThe first from the disaster were found in early 2011, using a Lidar scanning machine. In November 2021, just days before the 11th anniversary of the disaster, the police informed families that another two, possibly three, sets of remains had been discovered through borehole imaging. A total of eight have been identified in the mine.\nDetective superintendent Read said the most recent imagery was significant, but left many unanswered questions.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve noted previously, the search for answers over the last 11 years has been a long and painful journey for the families of the 29 men lost at the mine.\u201d\u2019\n\u201cThe drilling operation has provided police with valuable information to inform our investigation into the underground activity that led to the first explosion,\u201d he said.\nAnna Osborne, whose husband, Milton, was killed in the mine, told RNZ the news was difficult to hear, but not surprising.\n\u201cI am looking at it myself as a comfort, knowing that they didn\u2019t suffer for very long at all after the first explosion, if not instantaneously, they died.\u201d\nPolice are still conducting a criminal investigation into the mine explosion. A royal commission in 2012 found safety warnings were ignored at the site, and that government regulators had failed to inspect it effectively. No individual has ever been successfully prosecuted over the disaster.\n\n  New Zealand\u2019s government had spent more than NZ$50m (\u00a326m) on exploring the access tunnel in an attempt to find the remains. In 2021, the government announced it would stop funding that mission, but continue to support the police inquiry.",

        "content": "Offset markets have important role as switching to renewable energy alone not enough, according to thinktank\nRemoving carbon dioxide from the air will now be essential if there is to be any chance of meeting global climate targets, a thinktank has warned.\nCarbon offset markets will need to be tidied up and managed properly, as offsets will form a critical route to limiting global heating to 1.5C in line with scientific warnings, according to the Energy Transitions Commission, as switching to renewable energy alone will not produce enough carbon savings. Other methods, such as tree planting and carbon capture and storage, will also be critical.\nLord Adair Turner, the former head of the CBI and ex-chair of the UK government\u2019s Committee on Climate Change and now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, said carbon offsets and carbon markets were viewed with suspicion as they had been subject to mismanagement and abuse, but that well-functioning markets were possible.\n\u201cWe would encourage the tidying up of what has been an area with loose standards and loose claims,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt would be very unfortunate to take the past problems of the carbon markets and use that to say we should not use them at all. This is potentially a very large flow of money. So we should try to make sure that financial flow, which is valuable, is provided.\u201d\nThe Guardian and others have uncovered numerous instances of questionable benefits from carbon offsets offered for sale on the voluntary carbon markets, so-called because they are not formally regulated by governments.\nThe Energy Transitions Commission report, entitled Mind the Gap: How Carbon Dioxide Removals Must Complement Deep Decarbonisation to Keep 1.5\u00b0C Alive, examined ways of removing carbon from the air after it is emitted, in contrast to renewable energy which removes the need to emit carbon dioxide in the first place. Technologies to remove carbon dioxide, such as carbon capture and storage which requires liquefying the gas and pumping it into underground caverns, and direct air capture, using chemicals to suck carbon from the air, are still expensive.\nTurner warned that these technologies should not be seen as a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d, which companies and others could rely on to avoid having to switch to renewable energy or finding other ways of cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon removal could not be enough on its own, but would be needed to supplement green energy, he said.\nAn alternative to using these technologies is to grow trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, and which scientists have said must form a key part of any strategy to tackle the climate crisis. Funding to grow forests will be hard to achieve without the use of carbon offsets, Turner said.\nThe ETC report found that more than $200bn (\u00a3183bn) a year in total funding would be needed to remove enough carbon to stay within 1.5C, which over the next three decades would amount to about 0.25% of global GDP.\nThe markets for carbon offsets today reduce global emissions by only about 0.1%, according to the ETC. Companies alone would be unlikely to fund the removals needed, and government assistance would also be needed, the report found.\nTurner said carbon markets should be better regulated, to ensure that the cash they can generate is directed towards projects that provide genuine reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. That could be achieved by modelling the markets on existing financial trading, and by using modern monitoring techniques such as satellites to verify that emissions reductions have taken place, or that trees and forests were still standing.\nThe next instalment of the landmark four-part report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, is to be published next month. That section of the sixth assessment report, the latest comprehensive update of human knowledge of the climate crisis, drawing on the work of thousands of scientists over the past eight years, will contain sections examining carbon removal technologies and the potential for all carbon-cutting methods, from renewable energy to tree-planting.",

They don\u2019t care what they destroy,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t met Hitler. I think Putin is worse. He\u2019s a devil, not a human,\u201d she added, standing in the historic centre of one of Europe\u2019s most culturally important cities.\nBehind her, construction workers were busy erecting scaffolding around a Renaissance chapel. The friezes showing Jesus \u2013 in the garden of Gethsemane, being arrested by Roman soldiers \u2013 were about to be wrapped up. Around the corner a team perched on a giant crane were boarding up the cathedral\u2019s stain-glass windows.\n\u201cIf we lose our culture we lose our identity,\u201d said Onyschenko, the head of Lviv\u2019s city council heritage protection office. \u201cLviv has always been multicultural. Poles, Germans, Jews, Armenians and Hungarians built it. It\u2019s Unesco listed.\u201d She said she and her colleagues were working their way through a long list of objects that needed to be protected.\nRussia\u2019s war on Ukraine has been an all-round disaster. Its army has shelled densely populated cities, killing hundreds. More than 2 million refugees have fled abroad in Europe\u2019s biggest exodus since the second world war. In besieged Mariupol, families have spent more than a week living in desperate conditions without heat, water or power.\nAlongside this humanitarian catastrophe, cultural assets have been bombed and damaged. They include a museum in the city of Ivankiv, north-west of Kyiv, which housed dozens of works by the Ukrainian folk artist Maria Prymachenko, some now lost forever. Last week Russian forces shelled the assumption cathedral in Kharkiv, hurling debris into its nave.\nIn a video recorded early on Tuesday Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Moscow had flattened a 19th-century wooden church in the village of Viazivka, in the western Zhytomyr region. \u201cAn act of genocide against the Ukrainian nation,\u201d Olha Rutkovska, a member of the association for the protection of monuments, posted on Facebook.\nMany Ukrainians believe this vandalism is no accident. In an essay last summer Putin claimed Ukraine and Russia were \u201cone people\u201d and Zelenskiy has argued the Kremlin\u2019s ultimate goal is the \u201cerasure\u201d of Ukraine as an independent sovereign state. That includes its language, people and culture, suppressed during previous eras of Russification.\n\u201cThe USSR was one big totalitarian regime,\u201d Lviv museum director Olha Honchar told the Guardian. \u201cThey tried to make everything the same. They had one kind of monument, and one kind of artistic style with socialist realism. Moscow wants to eradicate Ukrainian culture. It\u2019s what defines us and our identity. It\u2019s a memory of who we are.\u201d\nHonchar \u2013 who runs the city\u2019s memorial museum of totalitarian regimes \u2013 said Ukrainian artists had resisted domination by Moscow, during communist times and today. Singers, actors and musicians had joined Ukraine\u2019s self-defence forces and were fighting against Russia. The film star Pasha Lee was killed on Sunday in shelling in Irpin, outside Kyiv.\nA group of museum directors had launched an initiative to send funds to cultural workers across the country. They included museum and library staff living in southern cities such as Kherson, now under Russian occupation. None had been paid, with the stipends from the European Commission and other donors used to buy food, Honchar said.\n\u201cRussians are used to living in a totalitarian system. They\u2019ve been zombified. We Ukrainians value critical thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that Russia and Ukraine are the same is a totalitarian myth dreamed up in Moscow. Lenin didn\u2019t invent us. We are different.\u201d Her museum built on the site of Lviv\u2019s Jewish ghetto is closed to visitors, with artefacts tucked away.\nThis week several of the city\u2019s other treasures were hidden. They included a precious wooden alter-piece showing Jesus, Mary and Mary Magdalene. It was removed from Lviv\u2019s 14th century Armenian church and transported to a bunker. The sculpture was last removed from its courtyard spot shortly before the Nazis swept into the city in 1941. Remarkably, Lviv\u2019s historic architecture survived the second world war.\nOn Tuesday city council workers in blue boiler suits rescued four limestone fountains adorned with mythical sculptures. Each occupies a corner of Lviv\u2019s old market square. Neptune and his trident vanished under fire resistant cladding. So did Amphitrite, Neptune\u2019s wife, and Diana and Adonis \u2013 the work of neo-classical German sculptor Hartman Witwer.\nIn Kyiv, the situation is more perilous. In the weeks before the war the culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, took few steps to preserve the capital\u2019s heritage. The Zelenskiy government was reluctant to remove exhibits, fearing this would contribute to a mood of panic. Some works are now being withdrawn from galleries, including Kyiv\u2019s art museum with its 19th century Russian masterpieces.\nMaria Glazunova who works at Kyiv\u2019s national film archive, said the city authorities had started showing some of its collection in metro stations, used by locals as shelter from Russian artillery. They were screening silent films and cartoons, including a popular animation starring the character Petryk Pyatochkin, put on in Dorohozhychi station.\nElsewhere in the country the picture is bleak. Concerns have been raised about the fate of a small museum devoted to Anton Chekhov in Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, where the Russian playwright spent time as a youth in the late 1880s. Fighting has been reported close to the museum. An airstrike killed several civilians on Tuesday, including children.\nLazare Eloundou, head of Unesco\u2019s World Heritage Centre, said the UN\u2019s cultural body was receiving \u201cmore and more reports of the destruction of cultural heritage in several cities\u201d.\nOf particular concern was Kharkiv, which is designated a Unesco creative city \u201cwith a vibrant cultural life\u201d and Chernihiv, where the 11th century city centre had been damaged. \u201cThere are many others. The whole of cultural life has been affected, and we have grave concerns about what will happen next,\u201d Eloundou said.\nUnesco officials were in contact with cultural professionals in Ukraine, he added. \u201cPeople are taking action to protect cultural heritage. We are providing what assistance we can. We are working with our international partners to monitor damage using satellite imagery. We will continue to bring together cultural heritage professionals to put together an action plan,\u201d he said.\nElondou described Ukraine\u2019s heritage as \u201cimportant for the entire world\u201d. It is the responsibility of the international community to do what it can to protect world heritage sites. As well as protecting cultural heritage for its own sake, it will also help the people of Ukraine to recover from the trauma after this conflict,\u201d he said.\nVolunteers are identifying and archiving material from Ukrainian cultural institutions to save it for future generations. More than 1,000 librarians, archivists and researchers are involved in Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online, using a combination of technologies to crawl and archive sites and content.\nBack at the Latin cathedral, the sound of praying could be heard from several side-chapels \u2013 together with banging and the whirr of a drill from workers outside. The lavish rococo interior with its gilt and magenta colours is intact \u2013 for now. \u201cThe world won\u2019t protect our air space. In the meantime we will protect our cultural monuments,\u201d Onyshchenko said.",

As its name suggests, this colourful species is found nowhere else on the planet.\nMy guide, Willow, and I had been hearing the parrots\u2019 calls for the past hour but the birds were always hidden in the thick canopy above. Now, at last, we reached a viewpoint overlooking the forest, where we had a real chance of seeing them.\nOn brief excursions during our family holiday, I had already caught up with three of St Lucia\u2019s five endemic species: the brightly coloured warbler, the elusive black finch, and the perky pewee, a type of flycatcher. Later I would also see the island\u2019s eponymous oriole, an apparition in black and orange. But like most visiting birders, the one I really wanted to see was the parrot.\nWe patiently scanned the tree canopy below. Eventually, with a raucous volley of calls, two stocky birds flew over the treetops: pea-green with a blue head, flashes of yellow and bright crimson wing-patches. It was well worth the wait.\nIn 1979, when St Lucia won independence from the UK, there were fewer than 100 parrots. Today, thanks to conservationists, there are more than three times as many. So, exactly 43 years after the island finally achieved freedom, we could celebrate the comeback of this very special bird.",

Chinese construction support will also take place at nine other facilities across the city.\nAs Hong Kong struggles with a devastating fifth wave, authorities have heavily relied on Beijing for support. Doctors and nurses from the mainland have also been allowed to work in the city, while Beijing has provided 29m rapid antigen tests and 54m masks as of Tuesday.\nThe city reported 28,466 local infections and 291 more deaths on Tuesday. The Omicron-fuelled outbreak pushed the city\u2019s daily community infections to a record of 56,827 last Thursday. Hong Kong has been recording about 150 deaths each day, giving it the world\u2019s highest death rate per 1 million people, according to the Our World in Data.\nThe outbreak has inundated the city\u2019s hospitals, with some seeing patients in hospital beds moved into car parks. At least one hospital has temporarily stored bodies in its corridors, while the city\u2019s morgues have also hit capacity. Supermarkets and pharmacies have experienced shortages as residents stockpile supplies. Schools have also been forced to close until April.\nThe majority of Covid deaths have been among the unvaccinated elderly. Around 70% of Hong Kong\u2019s population has been fully vaccinated against the virus, although the percentage is lower among seniors despite consistent government efforts to raise vaccination levels.\nDespite the record infections, a top Chinese health official in Hong Kong on Tuesday urged city authorities to persevere its \u201cdynamic zero approach\u201d to drive infections down to as close to zero as possible.\n\u201cReducing infection, severe cases and deaths is Hong Kong\u2019s most urgent and top priority at the current stage,\u201d said China\u2019s national health Commission\u2019s Liang Wannian told Chinese state media Xinhua.\nThe latest wave may have however reached its peak, according to new modelling data from researchers at the University of Hong Kong on Tuesday. The new estimates suggest the city\u2019s daily infections will drop down to the hundreds by late April.\nThe new figures also suggest that up to 2 million people have been infected with the virus since the latest outbreak began in February, almost a third of the city\u2019s population.\nHong Kong has also rolled back on previous plans for city-wide mandatory testing, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Wednesday saying it was no longer a priority, though may still be conducted.\nOfficials had previously floated plans to test the city\u2019s entire population - similar to operations on mainland China in a bid to curb infections \u2013 although not date had been set.\nAdditional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu.",

S&P was \u201ccomfortable broadly with the credit ratings where they are\u201d.\nVictoria\u2019s debt load was higher than NSW as a proportion of the population, gross state product, and as a proportion of revenues, he said.\nState debt, though, had risen 90% since the 2019-20 fiscal year, representing an \u201cextraordinary change in political sentiment\u201d, the report said.\nAnd it's worth remembering that our 'fastest GDP growth rate\" in decades has been largely debt-fuelled, particularly as the federal level. According the mid-year forecasts from last November, the $1 trillion net debt 'landmark' is not that far down the track. pic.twitter.com/PzkaFTg9fE\nS&P described the shift as an \u201conly Nixon could go to China\u201d moment, with centre right governments leading the spending growth.\n\u201cIntervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) provided political cover for states to go large,\u201d it said.\nFoo said \u201cconservative governments who might have once been very concerned about debt and deficits are probably less concerned or have eased some of that concern over the past three years\u201d.\nThe NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said his state had spent $45bn in health and economic programs to get through the pandemic.\nMuch of that had gone to protect \u201cthe fabric of the economy\u201d, such as ensuring workers remained connected to their companies, allowing them to rebound as Covid restrictions eased.\n\u201cWe will always put people before the budget,\u201d Kean said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we invested to keep our community safe through the pandemic.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nStill, the government would have to make way for businesses to drive growth in the future. \u201cThe private sector will be able to take over and fill the gap,\u201d he said.\nThe large-scale floods that have hit eastern Australia will probably bring another call on the state\u2019s coffers.\nThe government\u2019s flood disaster recovery small business grants \u2013 that offer support up to $50,000, as announced on Wednesday \u2013 would cost as much as $200m, Kean said.\nThe Guardian has also approached the Victorian government for comment.\nS&P excluded debt issued by the Northern Territory as they do not provide a rating for it.",

        "content": "As anglophone separatists continue their conflict with the government, women\u2019s voices must be heard to find a solution\nYoung girls should never be forced to have sex to get through a security checkpoint. Female activists or rebels should not be relegated to side discussions because of their gender. And women should be able to advocate for peace without fear of reprisals. Yet in Cameroon\u2019s conflict between English-speaking separatists and the government, this is the reality for many women and girls.\nComing to grips with this reality is critical to move beyond the simplistic view that it\u2019s only men who play an active role in the conflict. Women are involved as peace or political activists. Others have joined separatist militias or are key community influencers. But whatever side of the divide they are on, anglophone women in Cameroon have one thing in common: the government and separatists have largely ignored their concerns.\nThis is a mistake.\nIgnoring women\u2019s views means overlooking key constituencies and new perspectives on the conflict. Despite the deeply patriarchal nature of Cameroon\u2019s society, some women command considerable influence, especially at grassroots level and within families. Further, the different harms suffered by women require special attention from the government, separatists and international partners.\nThe crisis in Cameroon\u2019s two English-speaking regions began in 2017 when peaceful protests aimed at preserving their distinct legal and educational systems degenerated into armed rebellion. The conflict has killed about 6,000 people and displaced more than half a million. Military operations in the regions have failed to subdue the separatists, who increasingly use improvised explosive devices and military-grade weaponry.\nWomen and girls make up most of the displaced. Most have to fend for themselves, forced to negotiate access to basic services, housing and employment. Sexual abuse by the warring parties is rampant, with some using rape to punish women they see as supporting their opponents.\nBut women are not just victims, and understanding their roles in the insurgency helps explain its tenacity. Maternal validation carries significant cultural weight in the English-speaking regions, and men who joined militias were often encouraged to do so by women. Women engage in combat, gather intelligence, nurse the injured or cook. Some joined the separatists for political reasons; others are seeking revenge for abuses by security forces or are coerced.\nWomen are also active as peacemakers. Paradoxically, the patriarchal perception that women are naturally inclined to peace initially allowed women to organise undisturbed. But as their prominence grew, women\u2019s groups successfully pressed for relief measures and the government and separatists became more intolerant of their activism. Despite the space they have managed to carve out for themselves, female activists largely remain excluded from the political debate or see their concerns relegated to the margins.\nIt is time the government and separatists stop overlooking the role of women in the war. With the help of international partners, they should protect women from sexual violence, primarily by ending impunity for those responsible. The health ministry should also offer medical and psychological treatment to rape survivors.\nThe government should also step up efforts to help the displaced by providing economic support and reissuing identity documents, as without them displaced women cannot get jobs, open a bank account, start a formal business or marry, and are harassed at security checkpoints.\nAlthough there is no peace process at present, women will need to be included in negotiations when the sides are ready to talk: their buy-in is critical to building sustainable peace. Women not only provide useful perspectives on the conflict, they can also serve as advocates for a political settlement.\nThis is not wishful thinking. We have both worked for peace in Liberia and have seen first-hand how women\u2019s empowerment can move a country toward reconciliation. In Cameroon, preparations for women\u2019s involvement in a peace process should start now.\n Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is a Nobel peace prize laureate, former president of Liberia and a member of the International Crisis Group\u2019s board of trustees.

Both were wearing body cameras at the time of the incident.\n\u201cAt this stage, we\u2019re not sure how many shots struck the person in hospital,\u201d White said.\n\u201cIt will form a major part of the investigation as would the distance between the man and the officer at the time the shots were fired.\u201d\nThe man was taken to Darwin hospital where he underwent surgery. A hospital spokesperson said he remained in a critical condition on Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201cWe certainly know today that his condition has improved from his injuries and the work that the hospital has done to provide all the care necessary to him is nothing but exceptional,\u201d White said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re providing all assistance available to all members involved in the shooting \u2013 all members who responded to it and more broadly we\u2019ve reached out to the family and are doing everything we can to engage with them \u2026 to ensure they have a full appreciation of what occurred.\u201d\nWhite said a critical incident investigation had been launched into why the man was allegedly armed and the response of the officers. All oversight bodies had been briefed.\nThe investigation will examine the use of force by officers, including what other options were considered or deployed. Investigators will liaise with the injured man\u2019s family and the wider Indigenous community.\nWhite said at least 45 detectives were currently working on the investigation, door knocking and examining the scene of the incident with forensic analysis.\nRoads were closed around the scene of the shooting on Tuesday night, while on Wednesday morning the immediate area was cordoned off.\nWhite said police also worked with a school nearby to ensure all students returned home safely amid ongoing activity at the scene.\n\u201cWhat occurred yesterday was a critical event where police used potentially lethal force to subdue a person,\u201d White said.\n\u201cClearly that can cause angst in the community and we\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure officer safety, the safety of our families and the community more broadly.\n\u201cPolice are doing everything they can to investigate it and get to the bottom of what occurred so we can assure the community this isn\u2019t going to happen again.\u201d\nA report released by the Australian Institute of Criminology last year found fatal police shootings were at a record high since documentation began in 1989-1990.\nThe data showed there had been a 78% increase in fatal police shootings Australia-wide between 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.\nOf the 164 police shootings since 1989-1990, 10 victims were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peeopl, representing 6.1% of incidents despite Indigenous people accounting for 3.3% of the Australian population.\nThere have been 500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody in Australia since a royal commission aimed at preventing Indigenous deaths in the justice system was handed down in 1991.",

He said that is entirely the discretion of the prime minister but there remains uncertainty around when it will be held, making it harder to wrap a \u201cpolitical event\u201d in with religious or cultural events which have a set date known well in advance.\nEvans noted that writs for the election can be issued with as little as 33 days notice, meaning if the council\u2019s interpretation of the law holds, the Daniel campaign would only be able to put up signs for 47 days, giving the incumbent \u2013 who they argue is better known in the electorate \u2013 an advantage.\nCounsel for Bayside council, Emrys Nekvapil, argued the rules were designed to protect the \u201cvisual amenity\u201d of the area.\n\u201cSigns have a particular capacity to change the visual landscape. And so it\u2019s not surprising in that sense that they are regulated by the planning law of this state,\u201d he said.\nNekvapil argued the signs were promoting an event, that is, the upcoming election for the federal seat of Goldstein.\nDixon reserved his judgment, and the council took an undertaking not to enforce the current rule in the meantime.",

        "content": "The British property tycoon Nick Candy is working on a \u00a32.5bn bid to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, who has received an offer from a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly and Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss.\nAbramovich put Chelsea up for sale last week and interest in the club is growing. Candy, a Chelsea fan, wants to submit a bid and the 49-year-old is talking to American investors as he tries to build a consortium capable of rivalling Boehly\u2019s and Wyss\u2019s group.\nSources have said that Candy, whose proposal would include a plan to redevelop Stamford Bridge, will be unable to bid on his own. The success of any offer he puts to Abramovich will depend on who he can bring on board.\nIt has been reported that Abramovich, who has faced calls in parliament for him to be sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine, is looking for as much as \u00a34bn for Chelsea. It remains to be seen whether the Russian will accept a significantly lower fee.\nA source noted that Abramovich\u2019s desire for a quick sale could lower his leverage in negotiations. However the 55-year-old is understood to want prospective buyers to show that they have a viable plan and funds to ensure Chelsea remain successful. Abramovich does not want the legacy he has built at Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 to go to waste.\nCandy, worth a reported 1.5bn, could boost his chances by committing to rebuild Stamford Bridge. Chelsea\u2019s ground is smaller than their rivals\u2019. There have been suggestions that the cost of a redevelopment could put off bidders.\nAbramovich is considering how to proceed after receiving an opening proposal from the consortium fronted by Boehly and Wyss. The size of the offer remains unknown but it is unlikely to be significantly higher than \u00a32bn. Wyss, an 86-year-old Swiss billionaire, has gone on the record to say that Abramovich\u2019s asking price is too high.\nBorn in Bern, Switzerland, 19 September 1935. He studied engineering, earned an MBA from Harvard, then worked in textiles in Asia and Europe. As a sideline he sold planes \u2013 with one sale introducing him to the co-founder of the Swiss medical device manufacturer Synthes. Wyss went on to found Synthes USA in 1977 and, in 2012, he sold it to Johnson & Johnson for $19.7bn (\u00a314.8bn).\nWhat is he worth now?\u00a0A more modest $5.8bn (\u00a34.3bn), having, in 2013, signed the Giving Pledge set up by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, committing to give away most of his fortune. His Wyss Foundation \u2013 focused on environmentalism and progressive, anti-Trump politics \u2013 holds over $2bn in assets. In 2018 he pledged to donate $1bn (\u00a3751m) to environmental causes.\u00a0\nAny controversies?\u00a0His financial influence on US politics, as a non-US citizen, has drawn criticism \u2013 but he remains focused on pushing an anti-populist agenda. Asked about Brexit in 2019, Wyss told Swiss paper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung how voters had been \u201cdeceived by populist statements... For the British people\u2019s sake, I hope that there will be another vote when all the facts are on the table.\u201d\u00a0\nSo why Chelsea?\u00a0He hasn\u2019t shared his vision, but the 86-year-old Wyoming resident isn\u2019t going it alone, with the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, forming part of a consortium. Boehly, an\u00a0investor, billionaire and fellow philanthropist,\u00a0had a solo takeover bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and has previously been linked with Tottenham. He told Bloomberg at the time: \"One of the great things the Premier League has is that it\u2019s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. When I was growing up, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn\u2019t know about Manchester United, I didn\u2019t know about Chelsea, I didn\u2019t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what\u2019s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is a global opportunity for the best clubs.\u201d David Hills\nBeyond the finances, Wyss and Boehly must convince Abramovich that they are the right people to take the club forward. One well-placed figure suggested that Abramovich is unsure about selling to them.\nWyss and Boehly, who part-owns the LA Dodgers, are sitting tight as they await a response. The identities of the other figures who have formed their consortium remain unknown.\nAbramovich, who vehemently denies allegations linking him to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state or that he has done anything to merit sanctions, has appointed the New York-based bank Raine to oversee the sale. Interested parties have been given until 15 March to submit bids. It is unlikely Abramovich would be permitted to sell Chelsea if the UK government imposed sanctions on him.\nThere has been speculation that Chelsea\u2019s next owners will come from America. Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, is reportedly readying a bid. The Chicago Cubs chairman, Thomas Ricketts, has been mentioned and there is reported interest from Josh Harris, although his stake in Crystal Palace could be a complicating factor.\nMuhsin Bayrak, a Turkish businessman, last week signalled his interest in buying Chelsea and on Tuesday said he would hold further talks with Abramovich\u2019s representatives on Thursday.\nThe uncertainty at Chelsea could have an impact on contract negotiations with Antonio R\u00fcdiger, Andreas Christensen and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta. Barcelona are close to signing Christensen on a free, although Bayern Munich have not pulled out of the race for the Denmark defender. Bar\u00e7a are also confident Azpilicueta will strengthen their defence on a free.",

The decision drew widespread condemnation from academics, \u200b\u200bwriters and intellectuals in Australia and internationally.\nThe vice-chancellor of the Australian National University and a Nobel prize winner for physics, Prof Brian Schmidt, told a Senate inquiry into the issue that the \u201cindependence of the research grant process is a core part of how liberal democracies work\u201d.\nHe said humanities and social science research helped \u201cbuild cultural awareness and an understanding of our society, which is clearly in the national interest\u201d.\n\u201cElected politicians must of course be accountable for the use of public money, but we believe ministers\u2019 decision making should in most cases stop at the point of deciding how much money Australia will invest in research and in what area,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is more fundamental than issues of parliamentary process. It is about the health of Australia\u2019s democracy and the vibrancy and resilience of our research system.\u201d\nSchmidt said the ministerial veto powers had become a problem for recruiting talented international researchers, with some having \u201cexpressed their concerns to the point of saying: \u2018I am not going to come to Australia until you sort this out.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThose are conversations I\u2019m having with people at the highest level of institutions globally,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIt is literally affecting my ability to attract talent to Australia.\u201d\nThe inquiry was initiated by Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, who has introduced a bill that would remove ministerial right to veto ARC grants that had been recommended for funding via peer-review processes.\nFaruqi noted that of the 80 submissions received by the Senate education and employment legislation committee, only three organisations opposed the bill: the ARC, the federal department of education and rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs.\nThose expressing support for the bill included Universities Australia, the peak body for Australia\u2019s 39 universities, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia, the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering and the National Tertiary Education Union.\nFour Coalition ministers have vetoed research grants that were selected for funding after a competitive review process led by the ARC\u2019s college of experts. In 2020, the then education minister Dan Tehan vetoed five grants on national security grounds; 11 were vetoed by Simon Birmingham in 2017 and 2018. Brendan Nelson was the first to exercise the ministerial veto power in 2005.\nMany who spoke at a public hearing on Wednesday described the \u201cchilling effect\u201d ministerial vetoes had on academic independence.\nThe chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, said: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask the captain of Australia\u2019s netball team to make a decision about the people who should be on the cricket team.\n\u201cWe respect the \u2013 in some cases, decades-long \u2013 expertise of those people in the college of experts to make very fine judgments about matters of \u2026 very complex research.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe deputy vice-chancellor for research at the University of Melbourne, Prof James McCluskey, said: \u201cIt can be bitterly demoralising and utterly bewildering when a grant recommended for funding by the college of experts is rejected apparently on the basis of a 150-word national interest test.\u201d\nMcCluskey and several others made reference to the Haldane principle, which suggests researchers rather than politicians should decide where research funds are best spent. \u201cThe Haldane principle was enshrined in the UK legislation, whereby research councils are autonomous and there is no ministerial power of veto,\u201d McCluskey said.\nThe president of the Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Prof Dan Woodman, said: \u201cThe best defence for our record of research excellence and academic freedom we think is something like this Haldane principle.\u201d\n\u201cIt recognises the absolute need for ministerial input into the higher-level decisions about where money is allocated and under what criteria, but it states that the granular decisions about individual research proposals \u2026 should be taken by researchers themselves through peer review.\u201d\nWoodman said that ministers had only deployed their veto powers in relation to applications from humanities and social sciences.\nThe acting chief executive of the ARC, Judi Zielke, told the inquiry: \u201cPeer review is the backbone of identifying quality research and robust research assessment.\u201d\n\u201cNonetheless, as the ARC is spending public money, we also have other considerations which we must take into account,\u201d she said.\nAsked by Faruqi whether she accepted that the ARC appeared to be out of step with the research community, Zielke \u2013 who has been in the role for five weeks \u2013 said she understood researchers\u2019 concerns that a ministerial \u201cresponse in this way does lead to a lack of credibility\u201d.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something that the ARC needs to step up and improve its communication in relation to,\u201d Zielke said.\nA public petition in support of the proposed legislative amendments has gained thousands of signatures.",

        "content": "Unemployment and inflation in Africa\u2019s largest economy is driving the desperate to unscrupulous loan companies\nShayo Adebayo, 28, an unemployed medical physiology graduate from south-west Nigeria, read from scores of abusive WhatsAapp messages and voice notes sent to her by debt collectors from quick loan companies.\n\u201cI will destroy your life,\u201d said one. \u201cI want to see your payment or else all hell will be let loose,\u201d said another. And another, which simply said \u201cenjoy your shame\u201d, arrived after a message calling her a fraud and thief was sent to her family, friends and everyone in her contacts, attached to a photo lifted from her Facebook page.\nAdebayo said the messages had been arriving on her phone almost every day since October, driving her to suicidal thoughts.\nShe is not alone in her anguish. Unemployment, inflation and the cost of living have all risen sharply in recent years in Africa\u2019s largest economy, fuelling a burgeoning quick \u2013 or payday \u2013 loan industry. Adverts for quick loans have appeared at bus stops and street corners and been broadcast on the radio.\nMessages like those sent to Adebayo\u2019s contacts have gone viral on social media, bringing the companies\u2019 attempts to harass and shame people who are struggling with debts into focus.\nFor months Adebayo had been relying on regular 40,000 naira (\u00a370) loans from a loan company based in Lagos, to pay for transport and food until payday. In October she lost her job and her debt spiralled.\nBetween October and December Adebayo downloaded 32 quick loan application forms to her phone as she struggled to cover her debts.\n\u201cFirst I was borrowing just to make it to the end of the month,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I was borrowing to pay back the loan, then borrowing more to pay that one and on and on. By the end of it, I had taken loans from so many apps.\u201d\nAdebayo said that as she began to struggle to pay off her debts, payment reminders quickly turned into sinister threats, first sent to her and then to almost everyone important in her life.\nAs a condition for a loan, the application process required access to her contacts, social media accounts, and details of family and friends, where she worked, worshipped and lived.\n\u201cBy the time you take the loan, you\u2019re basically naked. They know everything about you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when you\u2019re not able to pay, they start working on those contacts.\u201d\nDebt collectors constantly called and sent texts and WhatsApp broadcast messages to her phone contacts. \u201cTheir weapon is your shame,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they do it. They use that to get to you.\u201d\nCalls for the government to clamp down on the companies have grown. Many are accused of operating without registration, and of warning employees against revealing details about their operations, according to former staff.\nSome of the loan companies enforce illegal conditions, paying below the minimum wage and incentivising abusive behaviour, according to several former staff.\nSophie Olubode worked as a debt collector for months last year at a quick loans company that employs more than 150 people and is based in an unmarked office building in Lagos.\nShe described the work environment as \u201ctoxic\u201d. Olubode said many staff were paid a basic salary below Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage of just 30,000 naira a month, and received bonuses based on debt collection targets. Each collector was incentivised to take extreme measures, she said.\n\u201cI remember a colleague of mine called one girl\u2019s dad and told him that his daughter was in the police station and that until the father pays the debt amount, they\u2019re not going to release the girl,\u201d she said.\nIn typical cases, people were requesting loans for as low as 2,000 naira, she said, often to cover things like food and transport costs and medical bills. The application process, she said, worked \u201clike a trap\u201d, and for many people outstanding debts of as little as 500 naira quickly ran to thousands.\nMost of Adebayo\u2019s debts remain unpaid, but she said she turned a corner when she found support on a Facebook group used by 19,000 thousand people, many in similar or even worse situations. Stories of abuse and harassment are reported daily.\nPeople on the group encourage others to pay back their debts but not to be overwhelmed by the threats. Documents produced by loan company agents purporting to be from police are debunked, and people share messages where they have responded to threats with jokes or taunts.\n\u201cSome of the chats are actually funny,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cThey joke about it. It makes you feel like: OK, I can deal with this, they can\u2019t kill me.\u201d\nThe Facebook group was founded by 32-year-old Willis Osunde, an unemployed economics graduate, after his own ongoing experiences with fast loan companies began.\n\u201cWhen they defamed me, messaging my contacts, I lost almost everything,\u201d Osunde said. \u201cMy marriage, my family, my job, all at the same time. It started from 2019, right up until last year \u2026 It occurred to me that I may not be alone.\u201d Osunde is still paying back.\nIn November, Nigerian financial crime and central bank authorities created a \u201clenders taskforce\u201d to investigate the rise of loan sharks, with regulators becoming increasingly active at pursuing companies accused of harassment and abuse. Victims of illegal practices have been encouraged to contact the taskforce, though many in the Facebook group felt more urgent action was needed.\n\u201cPeople are still vulnerable to these companies,\u201d said Osunde. \u201cIn this economy, a lot of people are desperate.\u201d",

        "content": "British bus operator makes U-turn on \u00a31.9bn proposal and agrees deal with fund managed by German firm DWS\nThe British bus operator Stagecoach has dropped its support for a \u00a31.9bn merger with National Express, instead agreeing to be taken over by a big German infrastructure fund in a \u00a3595m deal.\nIn a sudden U-turn, Stagecoach said it was recommending a sale to the fund managed by DWS Infrastructure for 105p a share in cash, and has withdrawn support for the National Express bid.\nThe announcement came just hours before Stagecoach suffered a strategic blow in its attempt to halt bus franchising around England. Last year Stagecoach and its fellow operator Rotala were granted a judicial review of Greater Manchester\u2019s plans to introduce franchising, but in a judgment on Wednesday, the plans were upheld as lawful.\nStagecoach has fought bitterly against plans to reverse the deregulation that enabled its initial growth in the 1980s. Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said the verdict was \u201ctruly fantastic news for everyone outside London who wishes to see a return to a bus service that puts people ahead of profit\u201d and \u201ca green light for the north to retake control of its bus and public transport system\u201d.\nShares in Stagecoach ended 36% up on the day despite the verdict, with shareholders set to profit from the DWS bid replacing the all-share deal apparently sealed in December, that would have brought Stagecoach\u2019s UK local bus operations together with National Express\u2019s intercity coach network.\n  That tie-up was being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority, which served an initial enforcement order in January to stop the firms from combining operations or selling any UK businesses while it looked into the deal.\nDWS, spun out from Deutsche Bank in 2018 via a flotation on the Frankfurt stock exchange, has a number of other investments in the UK, including Corelink Rail Infrastructure; Kelda, the owner of Yorkshire Water; and Peel Ports.\nStagecoach said the DWS bid offered greater certainty for investors and its 24,000 employees, with the overall headcount of bus drivers expected to remain the same, while Stagecoach\u2019s headquarters in Perth, central Scotland, will be retained along with its staff. It added that the new deal, which is expected to be completed in the first half of this year, would also provide continuity at the top, with the chief executive, finance director and UK managing director staying on.\nMartin Griffiths, the chief executive of Stagecoach, said: \u201cThe proposed offer presents a major opportunity to maximise the significant growth potential ahead as governments seek to deliver economic recovery, level up communities, provide better health outcomes for citizens, and transition to a net zero future.\n\u201cWe believe it will open a new and exciting chapter for Stagecoach, backed by a team who share our vision for a more sustainable future.\u201d\nStagecoach was launched in 1980 by a Scottish businessman, Sir Brian Souter, and his sister, Dame Ann Gloag. The DWS takeover will mark the end of the Souter family\u2019s long interest in the sector, having grown from buying out a small local bus company to one of the main players in Britain\u2019s privatised bus and rail industries.\nUnder the terms of the DWS takeover, Souter\u2019s 14.5% stake in Stagecoach is worth \u00a386.2m, while Gloag\u2019s 10.5% holding is worth \u00a362.5m.\nIn recent years, Stagecoach has shrunk, after selling its US operations and being squeezed out of UK rail. National Express also left UK rail after selling its last franchise in 2017 but still runs trains in Germany and buses in the US, Canada, Morocco and Spain.",

        "content": "Uncanny tale finds a wealthy single-parent family thrown into disarray when teenager Betsey stops eating but mysteriously stays the same weight\nScots film-maker Ruth Paxton makes a very smart feature debut with this genuinely uncanny psychological horror-satire written by Justin Bull, about body image and the eating disorder from hell. Sienna Guillory is excellent as the stylish and well-to-do Holly, a single mum who cares deeply about her two teen daughters Betsey (Jessica Alexander) and Izzy (Ruby Stokes). Holly is maybe a little too caring and controlling: she spends ages creating beautiful meals for the girls and has a slightly cringe-making habit of making sure the loo rolls are laid out neatly, with the end of one folded into a cutesy \u201csailboat\u201d design.\nJust when the family\u2019s life seems entirely picture perfect, a strange, self-questioning malaise sets in: Betsey\u2019s teacher asks her about university plans and what really interests her \u2013 a question that Betsey finds insidiously discomfiting. Meanwhile, Holly is watching Izzy ice-skating and out of the blue, up there in the bleachers, wonders to herself: \u201cWhat is the point of it all?\u201d Betsey has a nasty experience with drugs at a party, wanders out into some surrounding woodland where she appears to have an epiphany under a blood-red moon and from then on, she never eats another thing \u2013 but stays at exactly the same weight. Holly yells at her: \u201cYou have anorexia! And do you know who gets it? Entitled middle-class white girls!\u201d\nBut Betsey\u2019s shrewdly unsentimental gran (a nice performance from Lindsay Duncan) compares Betsey to the Japanese mythic monster, the Futakuchi-onna, the woman with a second mouth hidden under her hair at the back of her head. Is Betsey a vampiric daemon, secretly consuming her family\u2019s psychic happiness to keep her own weight up? Or is there another, more rational explanation connected with Holly\u2019s relationship with food and with her mother? Paxton\u2019s movie sketches out the sinister dread just under the happy-family surface; she is in expert control of her film, achieving her effects with economy and force. It is really unnerving.\n A Banquet is released on 11 March in cinemas and on digital platforms.",

        "content": "Analysis: the public spat over planes is a setback and the upshot of this mini-debacle is that Russia retains air superiority\nThe buck-passing between Poland and the US over the possible use of elderly MiG-29s to hit Russian forces inside Ukraine is one of the west\u2019s few diplomatic failures of the past month. It also raises questions about how far European countries are prepared to escalate militarily before they believe they will touch a dangerous Russian tripwire.\nThe US and Europe have worked hard to keep their differences over sanctions and oil embargos to a public minimum, and tried to accommodate each other\u2019s national interests. So it was striking on Tuesday when first the Pentagon described a Polish offer to send planes to the US airbase in Ramstein as \u201cuntenable\u201d, and then the deputy US secretary of state said the US had not been consulted about the plan.\nPart of the problem was that the Polish proposal was subtly but critically different to a scheme that had previously been discussed in private. Against the backdrop of highly charged diplomatic tensions, presentation matters.\nIn essence, Poland said it would cooperate in strengthening the Ukrainian air force so long as this would be seen in Moscow as a US, Nato or EU scheme but not a Polish one.\nIn its original, US-conceived iteration, the proposal was a trilateral deal whereby Poland would hand over the MiGs to Ukrainian pilots to fly into their homeland, and the US would then provide some substitute planes. Boris Johnson, an enthusiast, described the plan as \u201crent a MiG\u201d.\nThat proposal, arguably, was not qualitatively different to Nato members providing Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. In return, Poland would eventually fill the hole in its air force with 28 F-16s being provided by the US.\nBut under private pressure from the US, Poland felt the plan unduly exposed its citizens to Putin\u2019s ire. So instead, in a game of diplomatic pass the parcel, Poland tweaked the proposals so the planes would be sent free of charge to the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany, rather than being flown out of Poland into Ukraine. The move would literally take Poland out of the line of Russia\u2019s fire since the plan could be labelled as that of the US, Nato or the EU.\nPoland also suggested other frontline Nato countries with MiG planes should match its plan, a proposal directed at Slovakia and Romania. If executed it would mean Ukraine had 70 extra planes at its disposal.\nThe Pentagon\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cit is simply not clear to us that there is a tangible justification for this\u201d \u2013 was swift. Passing the parcel back, it said any decision to hand over planes ultimately rested with the Polish government, although it did not kill off the proposal altogether.\nIt is possible that Poland\u2019s nationalist government launched its plan with the aim of relieving pressure from the US Congress and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, knowing full well it would be rejected.\nEither way the public spat is a setback. Over the weekend the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said a plan involving planes was under active consideration.\nThe upshot after this mini-debacle is Russia retains air superiority. Ukrainian pilots who were being trained in Poland to fly the planes are now grounded with no machines with which to defend their country. An opportunity has been squandered.\nThe episode may have lessons for both sides. The possibility of making the MiG-29s available first appeared publicly on 27 February, when the EU made the unprecedented decision to provide military aid to a country outside the bloc. The first tranche of equipment for Ukraine is expected to amount to \u20ac500m (\u00a3417m), but up to \u20ac5bn is to be spent under the European Peace Initiative.\nIt was then that the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that aid for Kyiv would also include offensive weapons, including planes. At that point it became clear that the planes would only be MIG-29 and Su-25, because Ukrainian pilots only have experience with these machines. Poland, it would seem, did not appreciate the issue being disclosed. \nHowever, the country has emerged strengthened in another way from the past 24 hours. The US has provided Poland with two Patriot defence missile batteries. Each battery consists of two firing platoons with two launchers. This means there will be 16 launchers in Poland. They can have either four or six missiles. The latest Pac-3 MSE missiles are capable of shooting down the Russian Iskander ballistic and manoeuvring missiles.\nUnfortunately, they are also the anti-aircraft defence that Ukraine lacks. Nato, as its constitution requires, looks after its own.",

It is visited by Hans, to whom 36-year-old German actor Franz Rogowski brings his typically intense, coiled and opaque personality. It is 1969, just after the West German government has decriminalised gay sex. Hans, recently out of jail for this crime, wanders the subterranean sex-filled corridors with an unfathomable smile. Perhaps he sees their resemblance to prison, whose interiors themselves resemble the public lavatories where Hans broke the law, that prison to which lifer Hans had an institutionalised loyalty, part of the lost generations of gay men whose entire lives were pointlessly consumed.\nGreat Freedom is a formidably intelligent and well-acted prison movie and also a love story \u2013 or perhaps a paradoxically platonic bromance, stretching from the end of the second world war to the moon landing. Hans had been sent to the concentration camps in wartime and in 1945 finds himself back in prison with his number tattooed on his arm. Throughout the film, his civilian existence \u2013 his non-prison life \u2013 is mostly a mystery. We don\u2019t know about his family or whatever jobs he\u2019s been (briefly) doing. But we do know that he had a love affair with Oskar (Thomas Prenn) who is in prison with him in the 1950s. In the 60s, Hans has a prison moment with Leo (Anton von Lucke), the young teacher arrested with him in the toilet, and for whom Hans makes a self-sacrificial gesture to secure his freedom.\nHans\u2019s real relationship is with his cellmate, a stolid straight man called Viktor (Georg Friedrich), like Hans a recidivist veteran of the system who is initially overwhelmed with homophobic disgust at Hans, but then feels compassion on seeing his tattoo. As their friendship develops, Viktor (after glumly pondering his collection of straight porn) gruffly asks if Hans might, on what both men understand to be a strictly prison basis, attend to his personal needs. Poignantly, in fact tragically, both Viktor and Hans have a sense of themselves which is frozen in the 1940s: prison is for them their only life, certainly their only erotic life. Yet freedom, of a kind, has been available from within.\n Great Freedom is released on 11 March in cinemas.",

It warned the scale of funding cuts would affect the majority of social protection programmes designed to help \u201cthe poorest and most marginalised\u201d.\nSarah Champion, chair of the International Development Committee (IDC), said it was \u201cappalling\u201d that she had to use parliamentary privilege to make the report public. She said the government had blocked the committee from scrutinising the report for close to a year.\n\u201cOur committee was denied access to the equalities assessment seemingly for ministers to dodge the humiliation of admitting their own aid cuts undermined the government\u2019s key development objective: to support women and girls,\u201d said Champion.\nBefore posting it on the IDC website on Tuesday, which was International Women\u2019s Day, Champion made a final plea in parliament for the report to be published.\nThe foreign secretary, Liz Truss, refused.\n\u201cWe are restoring the aid budget for women and girls back to previous levels and we\u2019re also restoring the humanitarian aid budget, but it is a matter of policy that we don\u2019t publicly report equality impact assessments because it has a chilling effect and people can\u2019t be honest internally,\u201d said Truss.\nChampion responded that this was untrue, as the government had published similar reports into Covid policy.\nStephanie Draper, CEO at Bond, a UK international development network, said the government had put lives at risk by not publishing the report.\n\u201cIt\u2019s saddening that the harmful impact of the aid cuts on women and girls was known before it happened \u2013 and that nothing was done,\u201d said Draper.\n\u201cIf this assessment had been made public a year ago, NGOs and our partners could have mitigated risks to programmes protecting women and girls from gender-based violence and delivering clean water to marginalised communities.\u201d\nRose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK, called the government\u2019s actions shameful.\n\u201cThis is nothing less than a betrayal of women and girls around the world,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTo add insult to injury, we are only now learning about this through the legal immunity of an MP, and not in response to numerous letters and asks by MPs, peers, and civil society. This lack of transparency is unacceptable and suggests the government intended to bury these findings.\u201d",

It said on Wednesday it had started enforcement cases against all five companies.\nIn 2020 the Guardian revealed that water firms had discharged raw sewage into England\u2019s rivers 200,000 times the previous year. And last year Ofwat and the Environment Agency announced an investigation into potentially illegal dumping of raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters by water companies.\nThe inquiry came after evidence that the scale of illegal discharges of raw sewage could be 10 times higher than disclosed by the firms. As part of the inquiry, water companies had to disclose information about the way they operated their treatment works, including details of potentially illegal discharges into waterways.\n\u201cThe data that emerged at the end of last year suggested widespread shortcomings in how water companies were running sewage treatment works. The first phase of our investigation suggests those concerns are credible,\u201d said Ofwat\u2019s interim head, David Black.\n\u201cWe have identified shortcomings in most water and wastewater companies and are continuing to investigate. But we have already seen enough in five companies to cause serious concern and warrant us taking further action.\u201d\nOfwat said companies either reported a large number of wastewater treatment works that may not be meeting environmental rules, or failed to show how they were operating their works, or it had concerns about how companies met environmental obligations.\n\u201cWe will now dig deeper into what these five companies have been doing, with the prospect of formal enforcement against them if we find they are failing on obligations Ofwat enforces,\u201d Black said.\n\u201cWe will have further questions for all companies on this. In the meantime, we expect them to make quick progress in addressing any potential non-compliance they might have, whilst strengthening how they manage their environmental obligations as a whole.\u201d\nEarlier this year MPs on the environmental audit committee called for more assertive regulation of water companies as they said England\u2019s rivers had become a \u201cchemical cocktail\u201d of sewage, agricultural waste and plastics.\nMPs want to see an urgent review of the way water companies are allowed to self-report pollution, and are alarmed at the extent of sewage discharge, large spills by water companies and misreporting.\nSouthern Water was given a record \u00a390m fine last year for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into coastal waters off Kent and Hampshire over a five-year period.",

        "content": "Pakistan\u2019s captain is back playing in the Women\u2019s World Cup, having brought her six-month-old daughter Fatima with her\nIt is more than 33 years ago since Neneh Cherry swaggered around the Top of the Pops stage in big white trainers performing Buffalo Stance with the fierce energy of a woman who was having a fine old time and wanted everyone to know about it. Around her neck hung a huge medallion and she wore a golden bustier and matching jacket. But it wasn\u2019t her outfit that was the talking point at secondary school the next day \u2013 but the seven-month pregnancy bump that stuck proudly out of her Lycra miniskirt as she lip-synched along.\nIt was the first time many of us had seen a pregnant woman being, well, visible and certainly the only time we\u2019d seen one looking so sensationally cool. Allegedly, a journalist was daft enough to check with Cherry that it was safe for her to go on stage in her state of pregnancy, to which she sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s not an illness.\u201d\nIt was footage of the Pakistan captain, Bismah Maroof, holding her six-month-old daughter Fatima at the Women\u2019s World Cup in New Zealand that instantly brought back memories of that Thursday night watching Cherry. Although Maroof was dressed in her pine-green Pakistan tracksuit and had her hair pulled back in a sportswoman\u2019s ponytail, she radiated the same power to inspire change.\nSeeing female cricketers with their children is not unknown, and there are eight mothers playing in the current World Cup \u2013 Maroof, New Zealand\u2019s Amy Satterthwaite and her wife, Lea Tahuhu, West Indies\u2019 Afy Fletcher, Australia\u2019s Megan Schutt and Rachael Haynes, and Lizelle Lee and Masabata Klaas of South Africa \u2013 but it is practically unheard of on the subcontinent, where marriage and/or childbirth is usually the end for a cricketing career.\nA fantastic article by Annesha Ghosh in The Cricket Monthly, looking at motherhood and cricket, summarises that only three of the 81 female cricketers contracted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are married. Maroof, then, is an outlier, not only leading her country but showing that motherhood does not have to spell the end to sporting ambition.\nMaroof tells Ghosh that even during her own career, some of her teammates have had to give up the game: \u201cBatool [Fatima], Nain [Abidi], Asmavia [Iqbal], Qanita [Jalil] and several others \u2013 they were all Pakistan teammates of mine who either couldn\u2019t resume cricket for a long time after marriage or had to leave it altogether for good.\u201d\nHowever, the increased professionalism of the game over the past few years, and Maroof\u2019s own pregnancy, nudged the Pakistan Cricket Board, during Wasim Khan\u2019s spell as chief executive, into a maternity leave policy. This gives women a year\u2019s paid leave (and men a month) plus shared costs of a support person to help with childcare \u2013 in this case Maroof\u2019s mother, who has been seen cuddling Fatima in the stands.\nThe standout photos of Maroof and her baby came after the World Cup game between India and Pakistan on Sunday, won by India (therefore cementing their 100% record against Pakistan in one-day internationals). In them, members of the Indian team surround Maroof who is holding Fatima, cooing over the altogether cuteness of the baby in her red headband, playing peek-a-boo and trying to get her to look at the camera.\nThe sheer delight shared between the two teams is not something that is usually demonstrated between the Pakistan and Indian men\u2019s teams, whose matches in international tournaments are often hijacked by politicians and fans and turned into some kind of ridiculous proxy war, often ending in violence, either in the stands or on the streets. The lower profile of the women\u2019s matches, and the friendship between the players, has led to a far happier conclusion.\n\u201cComing back post-pregnancy in six months and playing international cricket is so inspiring,\u201d wrote Smriti Mandhana on Instagram. \u201cBismah Maroof setting an example for sportswomen across the globe. Lots of love to baby Fatima from India and I hope she picks the bat just like you because lefties are special.\u201d\nDespite the disparity in achievement between the two teams \u2013 India are ranked four and Pakistan eight \u2013 it is actually Pakistan who have taken the lead in franchise cricket, with Ramiz Raja, the Pakistan Cricket Board\u2019s player-chairman, announcing a women\u2019s branch of the Pakistan Super League to be played next year. Meanwhile the BCCI continues to stonewall on the possibility of a women\u2019s Indian Premier League, with the secretary, Jay Shah, saying it would happen \u201csoon\u201d, despite the obvious talent pool of female cricketers and a ready supply of foreign players desperate to be part of the story.\nBut, in the hours after International Women\u2019s Day, our thoughts should rest most with cricket-loving girls in Afghanistan, where the future of the women\u2019s cricket team is still unclear, and most teenage girls have now gone 173 days without returning to school after the Taliban took over.\nIn November, the Afghanistan Cricket Board\u2019s chair, Mirwais Ashraf, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s cricket is one of the major requirements of the ICC. Therefore it is committed to obtaining it.\u201d\nHowever, most of Afghanistan women\u2019s team are believed to have fled the country and on the ACB website there are no photographs of any female players, no details of any upcoming women\u2019s fixtures. In fact, no details on women\u2019s cricket at all.\n This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

        "content": "Denver picked up a new franchise quarterback in a blockbuster trade with Seattle on Tuesday. He will enter a division stacked with talent\nFor a while, this NFL\u2019s offseason\u2019s quarterback carousel barely moved. Tom Brady retired. So did Ben Roethlisberger. And despite a much-analyzed Instagram post from Aaron Rodgers that could have doubled as a retirement statement, the back-to-back MVP is staying put in Green Bay. This came after weeks of speculation that Rodgers might be headed to the very quarterback-needy Denver Broncos. Much to the dismay of Broncos fans and players, Rodgers took the sensible route on Tuesday and stayed in the city where he\u2019s had nothing but success. And his favorite teammate is sticking around too.\nSo all appeared to be pleasantly boring on the quarterback front until shortly after Rodgers confirmed he was staying in Wisconsin. And then Seattle dropped a BOOM louder than any produced by their storied defenses of the mid-2010s. The Seahawks traded Russell Wilson and a fourth-round pick to the Broncos for two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick, plus quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, and defensive lineman Shelby Harris. That, folks, is what we call a blockbuster.\nThere is much to dissect about the trade. Will Wilson follow in the footsteps of Peyton Manning and Brady and win a Super Bowl ring with a second franchise? Who will be Seattle\u2019s starting quarterback? Because surely it can\u2019t be Lock, even for one season. Will they use their newly acquired ninth overall selection on a quarterback or trade away draft picks for the rights to Deshaun Watson? Watson is clearly the biggest quarterback talent pining for a new team, but he\u2019s also mired in serious legal troubles. Grading a trade of this magnitude is a fun exercise but, in this case, highly irrelevant given the number of draft picks involved. Just because Seattle have a recent history of mostly whiffing in the draft (see: first-rounders LJ Collier, Rashaad Penny, and Germain Ifedi), doesn\u2019t mean that trend will continue. In truth, we may not know this trade\u2019s \u201cwinner\u201d for years.\nWhat we do know is with Wilson\u2019s migration to Denver, the AFC West has instantly become the NFL\u2019s splashiest division. Franchise quarterbacks are gold and Wilson joins Patrick Mahomes, Derek Carr, and Justin Herbert for a foursome that would be hard to refute as the best divisional group in NFL history. There have been divisions stacked with star quarterbacks before \u2013 for example, the 1993 AFC East featured Jim Kelly (Buffalo), Boomer Esiason (New York), Drew Bledsoe (New England), and Dan Marino (Miami) \u2013 but not one where everyone was a star quarterback. (Jeff George, Indianapolis\u2019s starting quarterback, was also in the AFC East that year.)\nIn Wilson, Mahomes, Carr, and Herbert, the division has quarterbacks that have won MVPs and Super Bowls, been in the MVP conversation, or are expected to be soon enough. The quartet has three of the top-five passing yard leaders from last season: Mahomes, Carr and Herbert combined for a whopping 14,657 passing yards in 2021. Add in Wilson, who has never had a playbook designed to let him air it out for an entire season yet has made his mark as one of the greatest magicians the NFL has ever seen. Except for Herbert, who is just getting started, these are all quarterbacks in their prime. If the NFL doesn\u2019t douse its 2022 primetime slate with AFC West games, the league needs new schedule makers.\nHow Wilson adapts to the Broncos, and how they react to having their first bonafide franchise quarter since Manning retired in 2015 will be fascinating enough. But Seattle without Wilson is an unfathomable reality to grasp. Wilson has been synonymous with the city since he was drafted by the Seahawks in the third-round a decade ago.\nSoon after news of the trade was made public, the Seahawks posted a now deleted tweet of the famous scene from Castaway in which Tom Hanks\u2019s character cries out for his friend, a volleyball named Wilson, as it floats away into the deep blue ocean.\nLooks like Russell Wilson isn\u2019t the only person who no longer works for the @Seahawks Fairly certain they just fired their social media manager too \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/oYA5GALWI5\nIt was an awkward clip to post given the rawness of the news. But also because the scene perfectly encapsulates how Wilson\u2019s departure (the quarterback not the volleyball) will affect the city of Seattle. The release of eight-time Pro Bowl linebacker Bobby Wagner hours after the Wilson trade confirmed the obvious. The Seahawks are officially in rebuild mode.\nUsually, we let the dust settle before determining where a player ranks in the NFL\u2019s pantheon. It\u2019s one reason players are not eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for five seasons once they retire.\nBut when it comes to the Russell Wilson Era in Seattle, the narrative is clear. Few quarterbacks have done more with less. Sure, Seattle were led by the Legion of Boom for a nice chunk of Wilson\u2019s tenure \u2013 the Seahawks led the league in scoring defense between 2012-2015. But it was after the \u201cboom\u201d faded that Wilson really made his mark. He kept up his wizardry on a freakishly consistent basis, all with a perennial low-end offensive line. Doug Baldwin and DK Metcalf have been big playmakers for the Seahawks, but Wilson is the reason Seattle had been a playoff mainstay, no matter the roster or challenges. Everything fell on Wilson\u2019s shoulders in recent years.\nNow he will bring his bag of tricks to Denver. The expectations will be high but the burden will be less considering the Broncos\u2019 solid defense and collection of young playmakers on offense. This new chapter in Wilson\u2019s career will be rooted in comparisons to his AFC West quarterbacking brethren. And rightly so. If all four quarterbacks stay on their current trajectory, the NFL is going to need as much AFC West as possible.",

They assisted the party until emergency and mountain rescue services were able to reach them.\u201d\nTwenty-three people, including about a dozen military personnel, either were airlifted off the 1,345-metre-high mountain by coastguard search and rescue helicopters from Prestwick and Inverness or were walked off the hill by some of the almost 40 rescuers who went to their aid.\nThe climber is the sixth person to have died in the Scottish mountains in the last two weeks, according to Police Scotland, with the search for a missing hill walker in Glencoe stood down on Wednesday because of weather conditions.\nMembers of Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams and a police mountain rescue team were sent to Ben Nevis after the alarm was raised at about 2.15pm on Tuesday.\nDonald Paterson, the deputy leader of the Lochaber team, said the conditions on the mountain were \u201cclassic alpine: springlike in the glen but above the snow line everything is solid and an ice axe and crampons are essential, and knowing how to use them\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThis chap had fallen, conservatively, about 300 metres. Then others went to help him and they, too, ended up in trouble. One had a broken ankle and another multiple abrasions.

With the result still too close to call, the identity of the leader of Asia\u2019s fourth biggest economy will not be made official until around midnight.\nA Yoon victory would end liberal hopes of securing another five years in the presidential Blue House as the successor to Moon Jae-in, a left-leaning former human rights lawyer.\nA record 37% of South Korea\u2019s 44 million eligible voters cast early ballots during a two-day period last week, the highest number since the system was introduced in 2013.\nThe polls closed at 6pm for most people but polling stations remained open for another 90 minutes to enable people with Covid-19 to vote.\nIn echoes of the 2020 national assembly elections, voters wore masks and used hand sanitiser, casting their ballots on the same day South Korea reported a record 342,446 new Covid-19 cases.\nMore than a million people are isolating at home after testing positive, health authorities say. The country amended its electoral laws last month to ensure they would be able to vote.\nYoon, who was hoping to benefit from public anger over rising house prices in Seoul, income inequality and youth unemployment, said during the campaign that he would address mounting economic problems with a dose of fiscal conservatism, including a cut in the minimum wage and the removal of limits on working hours.\nHe vowed to address the housing crisis with tax relief, pledged support for small businesses and self-employed people, and encouraged the private sector to create jobs and builds millions of new homes.\nPark Ki-tae, a 38-year-old resident of the capital, said after casting his vote: \u201cI\u2019m really worried about housing prices in Seoul and I hope the new president will focus on making people\u2019s lives easier and better.\u201d\nWhile North Korea\u2019s recent return to ballistic missile tests was lower down the list of voter priorities, Yoon\u2019s team has said he would restart talks with the regime in Pyongyang, while boosting South Korea\u2019s deterrent capabilities.\nThat could include buying an additional US missile defence system, despite criticism from China that its powerful radar can penetrate its territory. South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy the system, known as Thaad, in 2017 triggered economic retaliation from Beijing.\nA longtime member of Moon\u2019s Democratic party, Lee rose to prominence with an aggressive pandemic response, a populist economic agenda, and by touting his outsider image.\nLee has called for an expansionary fiscal policy and universal basic income of 1m won (\u00a3600) a year to every individual, as well as cash handouts to all people to soften the financial blow dealt by Covid-19.\nThe rest of the world will look for signs of a new approach to North Korea under South Korea\u2019s new president, after Moon\u2019s policy of engagement paved the way for summits with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, but made no progress on the key issue of nuclear weapons.\nYoon has said he supports a pre-emptive strike against North Korea if an attack appears imminent, but has promised \u201csignificant and immediate\u201d benefits if the regime takes verifiable steps towards denuclearisation.\nLee has said he would send special envoys to the US, China, Japan and North Korea as soon as he is elected in an attempt to revive negotiations and end the standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme. Controversially, he has called for exemptions to UN sanctions so that dormant inter-Korean economic projects can be revived.\nHaving appealed to young male voters who are unhappy about attempts under Moon to address gender inequality, Yoon could add fuel to the national debate over women\u2019s rights if, as president, he honours a campaign promise to abolish the gender equality ministry.\nHe has claimed that South Korean women do not suffer from \u201csystemic gender discrimination\u201d, even though the country performs poorly in international comparisons of the gender pay gap and female representation in senior management.\n\u201cThe widespread support Yoon enjoys from young men is frankly absolutely terrifying from a woman\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Keung Yoon Bae, an academic who voted on Wednesday.\nLee would keep the ministry, but in an apparent sop to anti-feminist voters he has said he would drop the word \u201cwomen\u201d from its official Korean-language title.\nThe winner, who like other South Korean presidents can serve only a single five-year term, will take office on 9 May.",

        "content": "Call comes as G7 agriculture ministers prepare to discuss food price volatility as war rages in Ukraine\nIrish dairy and beef farmers are being urged to start growing crops, as agriculture ministers from G7 countries including Britain\u2019s George Eustice prepare to meet on Friday to discuss grain shortages and food price volatility amid the war in Ukraine.\nThere are rising fears that consumers will face price hikes on staples such as bread in addition to rises in fuel, with grain supplies disrupted by the conflict.\nUkraine, once known as the breadbasket of Europe, said on Wednesday it was banning exports of rye, barley, buckwheat, millet, sugar, salt and meat for the rest of the year.\nTogether with Russia it supplies 30% of global wheat and barley, fuelling fears of shortages not seen since the second world war when consumers in Britain were encouraged to plant vegetables in gardens, yards and on rooftops.\nGovernment data shows Ukraine supplies 20% of the UK\u2019s cereals. Vikki Campbell, a market specialist at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), said the price of wheat futures \u2013 grain to be bought on 22 May \u2013 had gone up on six consecutive days.\nOn 18 February, days before war, wheat was trading in London at \u00a3220 a tonne, but had surged to \u00a3289.50 when the market closed on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe do know that supply chains are going to be facing extra costs. Fuel is going up for everyone and processing costs. If we look at a load of bread, wheat makes up 10% of the cost of a loaf you get in the supermarket with 90% coming from other parts of the supply chain, and we know other parts of the supply chain, such as fuel, have not been shielded,\u201d she said.\nRonald Kers, the chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, the UK\u2019s biggest chicken producer, said the cost of raising a chicken had increased by 50% since last January and he forecast food inflation would exceed predictions.\nKers said: \u201cBefore this war began, 4-5% food inflation was being forecast by mid-2022. But we now could see a hyper-inflationary environment at closer to 10-15% - more than it\u2019s been for 50 years - if this conflict isn\u2019t resolved quickly.\u201d\nCampbell said the market was already squeezed by shortages caused by drought in the US and Canada last year. The AHDB said the price of fertiliser had also shot up as it relied on natural gas.\nThe Irish agriculture minister, Charlie McConalogue, asked farmers to grow more crops to offset food supply issues caused by the Russian invasion. Farmers are urging the government to issue \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,670) vouchers to help them fertilise the land for crops and winter fodder.\nIrish farming is dominated by beef and dairy producers, with 60% of grain imported.\n\u201cFood security is really important over the next number of weeks and months and it is something we have to work together on,\u201d he told RT\u00c9.\nPressed on weekend reports that farmers would be instructed to grow grain \u2013 the first time this would have happened since the second world war \u2013 McConalogue said: \u201cI think one of the most economical things that any farm can do is consider planting some grain this year and they should look at that and consider their options.\u201d",

        "content": "Son of a champion stonelifter and brother of a pelota player on feeling like a kid, his messy Spain exit and Europa League hopes\nI came out twisted,\u201d Julen Lopetegui says. His father, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, was a harrijasotzailea, a champion Basque stonelifter who competed under the name Aguerre II, held the record for raising 22 100-kilo cylinders in a minute and rejected proposals from a promoter linked to Al Capone to become a heavyweight boxer. His uncle Luis, Aguerre I, had been a harrijasotzailea too, known throughout the land. And his brother Joxean was a professional pelotari. But then something went wrong.\nJulen could play Basque pelota too, a basket for a hand, the ball travelling faster than any sport on earth. \u201cI had a chance to be professional but my passion was football,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the black sheep of the family, hooked on football from the start. My dad was well known in an era when stonelifting was big, a living. My brother was a pelotari at a high level. But when I did the typical psychoanalyses, the \u2018what will you be?\u2019 tests at school, the first answer to come out was footballer. The second \u2013 get this \u2013 was football journalist. If I didn\u2019t play, at least I could see games for free.\u201d\nIf the world lost a byline, it gained a goalkeeper and eventually a coach, guided by lessons learned at home even if he chose the wrong sport. \u201cMy father was a great sportsman, an outstanding athlete, but he didn\u2019t do football at all,\u201d Lopetegui says. \u201cYet growing up with the values he instilled \u2013 effort, sacrifice, never seeking excuses \u2013 helped forge my character.\u201d He came out twisted but turned out all right. When Joxean was pelota champion in 1986, Julen was joining Castilla from Real Sociedad\u2019s academy \u2013 the start of a 17-year career that passed through Real Madrid and Barcelona and the 1994 World Cup.\nThen came coaching, a transition towards a profession, a calling, he dissects with fascinating depth: the methods applied, the price exacted, the ideals. \u201cI remember Luis Aragon\u00e9s telling me: \u2018Kid, listen, the first thing is: take off the shirt.\u2019 What\u2019s he talking about? Of course I\u2019ve taken it off. But I hadn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the same, like looking at the same river from two banks. Sometimes it\u2019s like giving a pill: you have to deliver it the right way.\u201d\nLopetegui nearly went to Wolves and held the most high-pressure jobs in Spain: Madrid and the selecci\u00f3n. On Thursday, his Sevilla team face West Ham in the Europa League.\nSevilla\u2019s captain, Ivan Rakitic, asked to describe his coach, says: \u201cWhen he gets home I\u2019m sure he explains [tactics] to his wife and daughter.\u201d Lopetegui protests: \u201cIf something football-related comes up, it\u2019s not because I mention it but because they ask.\u201d But then he adds, laughing: \u201cI\u2019m fortunate that for now my family accept me as I am.\u201d Intense is one word for a man who can end games looking as exhausted as his players.\n\u201cYou see yourself and sometimes you like what you see more than others,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut the conclusion I\u2019ve reached is I am what I am. There\u2019s no escaping that coaching takes a lot out of you. You have to learn to live with that craziness; if not you die. You have to overcome the biggest obstacle, which is being able to take the pressure and take it off your players. Your passion and energy aren\u2019t governed by age; you adapt, improve daily, change. That\u2019s what enables you to keep going.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause, a smile: \u201cFor as long as they want you. When they don\u2019t want you \u2026 \u201d\nCan you actually enjoy it? \u201cLike a little kid. Even the most difficult moments because that\u2019s when a coach\u2019s intervention has to be at its best. And the hard moments make the character.\u201d\nThere have been plenty. After a 10-game spell at Rayo, Lopetegui started with youth football, leading Spain to European titles at Under-19 and Under-21 level, in 2012 and 2013 respectively. There is a fulfilment and fondness in seeing \u201chis\u201d kids succeed \u2013 David de Gea, Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, Koke, \u00c1lvaro Morata and Dani Carvajal head a long list \u2013 but he sought something else. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the same pressure. It\u2019s not a \u2018hard drug\u2019; senior, elite football is the hard drug. My passion was always to coach at elite level.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t come much more elite, more pressured than this. Lopetegui was sacked from the Spain job on the eve of the 2018 World Cup, the RFEF president Jos\u00e9 Luis Rubiales reacting furiously to Real Madrid announcing him as their new manager. Forced to leave the training camp and return alone, there was something cruel and crushingly inevitable about his Bernab\u00e9u spell then not lasting long. The hurt, on the other hand, does.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I feel far removed from now,\u201d Lopetegui insists. \u201cEverything could have been handled better. We played the best teams in the world, except Brazil: England in England, Italy in Italy, Belgium in Belgium, Germany in Germany, France in France. Argentina at home. And as well as being unbeaten, we built a clear identity. We were ready to achieve very, very big things and it hurt because they took us out at the moment when hope was highest. Many coaches have gone to a club after a World Cup or Euros: it could have been handled far more naturally. But the chapter\u2019s closed.\u201d\nThe best revenge is to live well, they say. \u201cBut I\u2019d be a mediocre man if I took motivation from that, wanting to prove people wrong,\u201d Lopetegui responds. \u201cMotivation is inside you. You don\u2019t face the day thinking: \u2018Two years ago.\u2019 Your passion drives you. That\u2019s the good energy; the other kind, quite honestly, I really don\u2019t like it. You learn from bad experiences but the energy that drives you is intrinsic not extrinsic. It\u2019s hope I feed off, not the past.\u201d\nHe has certainly lived well. If there was some reticence when Lopetegui arrived in Seville, a hangover from the Spain fallout, it is long gone. When they won the derby recently, he stood before fans, holding his heart as they chanted his name. In his first season he had returned them to the Champions League and won the Europa League. Last season, they reached week 36 in the title race. This season, there\u2019s the Europa League again, the competition no one embraces like Sevilla and one Lopetegui insists \u201cbig teams really want to win; it has gained weight and prestige\u201d. Sevilla are also the only side aspiring to catch Madrid.\nThe gap is eight points but they\u2019re still fighting. It\u2019s a miracle they\u2019re even standing, the absentees in double figures most weeks. As he talks, the phone rings. It\u2019s the sporting director, Monchi. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s ringing to say he\u2019s signed Haaland,\u201d Lopetegui laughs. \u201cI\u2019d just like 11 [fit players].\u201d He glances at the whiteboard. \u201cSome days we trained with eight or nine,\u201d he says.\nRespite came in the winter window, Sevilla standing firm as Newcastle courted Diego Carlos and signing Tecatito Corona and Anthony Martial. In the summer, they had resisted Chelsea\u2019s \u00a342m bid for Jules Kound\u00e9, ambition expressed.\n\u201cThere were players who could have left but the offers didn\u2019t meet the valuation. It\u2019s important the players are then happy to continue. [Diego] is committed, there are no doubts \u2026 Anthony and Corona\u2019s arrivals help us improve. We\u2019re excited about Anthony. He can give us things others can\u2019t: a very good player technically and physically, powerful and versatile, playing wide or centrally. He gives that touch of quality at the end of a move and makes us a bit more vertical. We\u2019ll help him translate those qualities into performance as soon as possible.\u201d\nNo point imagining a Seville derby in Sevilla\u2019s stadium for the final? \u201cYou can imagine \u2026 but what happens in football is usually way beyond anything you imagined. There are a thousand examples.\u201d And, besides, West Ham are first.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s that you can\u2019t say: \u2018This will happen.\u2019 The future has twisted horns. All you can think about is today, and with the same enthusiasm as when you were a kid. The day I don\u2019t feel that, I won\u2019t be able to transmit it to my players: they have to feel the joy, the excitement. And there\u2019s something magical about football: every day something happens you weren\u2019t expecting. I walk in each morning and say: \u2018What have we got today?\u2019 Because there\u2019s always something.\u201d",

        "content": "The film-maker\u2019s follow-up to Tangerine and The Florida Project is another lo-fi comedy about lives at the margin of US society\nWith Red Rocket, Sean Baker has given us an adult American pastoral, essentially a comedy, and another study of tough lives at the margin, close in spirit to his lo-fi breakthrough Tangerine.\nActor, rapper, comedian and one-time porn performer Simon Rex gives an amusing performance as a washed-up adult movie actor with the unsubtle professional name of Mikey Saber. Mikey\u2019s career in LA has gone south, chiefly because he had regular work in the spoof sex franchise The Fast and Fury Ass \u2013 but as the porn version of the character played by Paul Walker, whose death put a catastrophic downer on Mikey\u2019s career.\nNow, with no money and sporting cuts and bruises from unexplained disputes with various business associates, Mikey is sheepishly returning to his home town of Texas City, Texas, where he infuriates and astonishes his abandoned wife and former leading lady in the local porn scene, Lexi (Bree Elrod), by asking if he can crash with her for a couple of days.\nAfter an unconvincing attempt to get a respectable job in one of the city\u2019s various fast-food outlets, Mikey starts dealing weed, while resuming conjugal relations with Lexi and regaling everyone with stories about the glamorous porn career he intends shortly to resume. But then Mikey finds himself falling in love with Strawberry (Suzanna Son), a young woman who works at the doughnut store. He is convinced she is a porn natural and his ticket back to the triple-X big time.\nThe year happens to be 2016, when Hillary Clinton is facing off with Donald Trump for the US presidency, but it is tempting to read Mikey as the embodiment of Trump right now in 2021, in retreat from a disaster, brooding on his imminent return.\nThis is vivid, real-life film-making, without the need of an epic budget. Amusingly, when the plot calls for a multi-vehicle pileup, Baker shows us Mikey\u2019s car going out of control, then cuts to the aftermath and reuses what appears to be genuine TV news footage of mangled cars on the freeway.\nMikey is a fast-talking hustler who has the predator-parasite\u2019s instinct for drawing other people into his orbit, and convincing them that his interests are their interests. However, he is often far from successful in this, and there is an awful moment when he is savagely beaten up by the parents of Strawberry\u2019s ex-boyfriend. But for all this, there is something poignant and even sympathetic about Mikey and Strawberry, and Baker lets us see that it would be sad if they wound up back in Texas City, but also just as sad if they made it to Los Angeles. You can picture Mikey growing old like the local people in Texas City, who are so very unimpressed to see him back.\n Red Rocket screened at the Cannes film festival, and is released in UK cinemas on 11 March.",

RT will remain on BitChute as long as we can legally host them.\u201d\nOfcom has launched 27 investigations into allegations of bias against RT\u2019s news coverage, which the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has called \u201cpoisonous propaganda\u201d, and it has the power to go as far as revoking RT\u2019s licence to broadcast in the UK.\nRT\u2019s UK TV channel has been unavailable in the UK since last Wednesday after it was removed from Sky, Freeview and Freesat as part of wider EU sanctions against Russia.\nLast week Google-owned YouTube, which is not regulated in the UK, moved to block channels related to RT and the Russian state news agency Sputnik across Europe owing to the war in Ukraine. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has restricted the pages of the two companies across Europe.\nUnder rules implemented two years ago, \u201cUK-established VSPs\u201d must protect users from harmful content, including to \u201cprotect the general public from criminal content and material likely to incite violence or hatred\u201d.\nBitChute is one of 20 companies on Ofcom\u2019s list of VSPs it monitors, but unlike its role in broadcasting regulation, the watchdog does not adjudicate complaints about content on VSPs. In addition, the VSP regime does not cover legal disinformation or propaganda and there are no standards of accuracy, impartiality or offence that VSPs must meet.\n\u201cUK video platforms must take measures to protect their users from illegal content, but our role is not to assess individual online videos,\u201d said an Ofcom spokesperson. \u201cWe have strict rules to ensure that TV channels are duly accurate and impartial.\u201d\nThe VSP regulations, which are to be superseded by much more stringent rules under the online safety bill, focus on providing guidance only and give companies flexibility to effectively police their own operations.\nChris Elmore, the shadow media minister, said: \u201cWhile the government goes at a glacial pace to regulate online spaces, lots of high-harm platforms operate with seeming impunity, spreading fake news.\n\u201cWe need tough action to take down RT, Putin\u2019s propaganda factory. While it is off air here due to action in Europe, ministers must press Ofcom to expedite their investigations into the channel and any platforms hosting their content. BitChute should not host RT\u2019s lies and misinformation anywhere.\u201d",

But I am talking to neither a cousin nor a colleague. Instead, I am talking to Will Smith.\nSo, Will, I say, just about resisting breaking into \u201cIn west Philadelphia, born and raised \u2026\u201d Have you been practising your Oscars speech since you were 12?\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he begins, then notices me writing his God-like words in my notebook. \u201cWait now, this isn\u2019t an interview! We\u2019re just chilling, OK?\u201d\nOK, Will, I say. And so, the Fresh Prince and I chill.\nWell, for five seconds anyway, until someone else comes along demanding the sunbeam of his attention. Just behind him, Javier Bardem and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz whisper and giggle to one another. Behind them, Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Garfield, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Paul Thomas Anderson stand in a cluster, talking intensely. As I walk back to my seat, film producer David Dinerstein comes up to me and asks, \u201cExcuse me, have you seen my director?\u201d I have, as it happens \u2013 it\u2019s Questlove, and he\u2019s two tables away from us, sitting next to Denzel Washington.\nThis is the Oscar nominees luncheon, the official moment the Oscars meat machine really grinds into action. The usual reason for the annual lunch is the big photo, in which all the nominees are photographed together, school picture-style. But this year, the Academy has decided that while it\u2019s now safe for more than 200 people to eat lunch next to one another in a basement for four hours, it\u2019s not yet safe for them to pose for a photo together. Instead, this year, they will pose in socially distanced batches of a dozen or so. No one ever came to Hollywood for sensible ideas.\nEvents kick off in what I guess could be described as the foyer, but is really little more than a carpeted corridor next to an underground car park. This is where the nominees mill around before the lunch itself. The first person I spot is Kenneth Branagh, who has three nominations this year (best original screenplay, best director and best picture, all for Belfast), surely making him a super-nominee. Is this the least glamorous film event he\u2019s ever been at?\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty knockabout, isn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s defiantly anti-anti-Covid,\u201d he says, looking at all the unmasked people spraying canap\u00e9s on one another. \u201cBut this is a very nice event because there are no prizes, so you can just say \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018well done\u2019 to people you admire. Plus, they mix everyone up so you\u2019re sat with so many new people.\u201d\nBranagh\u2019s last point, about being sat with people from other films, comes up a lot when I talk to the nominees, suggesting, perhaps, an understandable exhaustion some feel by the end of awards season, after travelling around for months with the people from their film.\n\u201cThe first time I came, I was sat with an animator and a makeup artist. It\u2019s eclectic, which I like,\u201d says JK Simmons (best supporting actor nominee for Being the Ricardos.) Not that he\u2019s entirely thrilled about being here this year: \u201cI\u2019m filled with Covid dread, as usual, but other than that it\u2019s delightful,\u201d he says, with a wary look around what could be the biggest celebrity super-spreader event in history. Simmons keeps his mask on for the entire event.\nMost people bring their partner as their plus one \u2013 Maggie Gyllenhaal (best adapted screenplay, The Lost Daughter) is accompanied by Peter Sarsgaard, who somehow actually looks good in a bright yellow suit; young Kodi Smit-McPhee (best supporting actor, The Power of the Dog) grips the hand of his girlfriend, Rebecca Phillipou, looking for all the world as if they were en route to the prom. But Lin-Manuel Miranda (best original song, Encanto) brings his most excellent father, the political strategist, Luis A Miranda Jr.\nAre the two of them excited about Lin-Manuel\u2019s imminent membership of the EGOT club, for people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony?\nLin-Manuel winces: \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a fait accompli! It hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it would be a pretty cool club to join.\u201d\nI tell him that the Uber driver who drove me to the lunch had We Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno on the stereo, the ubiquitous song he wrote for Encanto.\n\u201cMy kids are really into that song!\u201d he says, looking genuinely astonished.\n Your kids and everyone else\u2019s, Lin, I say.\n\u201cAnd that makes me very happy,\u201d he grins.\nAny discussion about winning is the one big faux pas at this lunch. For some, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a potential jinx. For others, it\u2019s because, they insist, they\u2019re \u201cjust enjoying the ride\u201d (Andrew Garfield, best actor, tick tick\u2026 BOOM!) Everyone is, of course, ludicrously overdressed for a Monday lunchtime, and the big trend at this lunch is showing your stomach, as modelled by Kristen Stewart (best actress, Spencer), Coda\u2019s Emilia Jones and Gyllenhaal. Someone who is very much not modelling this trend is Guillermo del Toro (best picture, Nightmare Alley), who is the nominee everyone wants to talk to, and he greets them all with an anti-anti-Covid smooch on the cheek.\nAt last, we are ushered into the ballroom, which is filled with circular tables, each with chairs for 10 or so people. Everyone is assigned to a table and Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are sat with Jessica Chastain (best actress, The Eyes of Tammy Faye), Stewart is sat a stone\u2019s throw away from Billie Eilish (best original Song, No Time to Die). I am seated back to back with Stewart and next to the delightful Bob Morgan (best costume design, Dune) and his partner, Philip Schurer, an actor. This is Morgan\u2019s first nomination and, for the occasion, Schurer accessorised his tux with a pin of the Ukrainian flag.\n\u201cIt was pretty surreal getting ready for this while watching the news. Now here we are, drinking champagne while people are running for their lives,\u201d Morgan says. In fact, we are drinking Coppola chardonnay at this point while waiters bring our three course gluten-free meal.\nIn recent years, the Oscars have felt like an exercise in self-flagellation, with politically charged acceptance speeches far outnumbering the jokes. At first, it looks like this lunch will maintain the tradition when a slide appears on the large screen at the front of the room: \u201cWe gather to celebrate your nomination on the ancestral lands of the Tongva people.\u201d But perhaps it\u2019s because the news is so unremittingly terrible, or maybe it\u2019s that the Oscars have been leaching viewers, but someone has decided that people need laughs rather than lectures. So we next get a short satirical film from Saturday Night Live\u2019s Kate McKinnon about how to accept awards, which is far too funny to only be seen by 200-or-so people.\nThen the Oscars\u2019 very enthusiastic producer, Will Packer, takes to the stage. \u201c[After Covid], we are all survivors. And the people in this room are thrivers,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cWe are part of an industry that makes people feel something. In that sense, you are all essential!\u201d This, unsurprisingly, gets big applause.\nAcademy president David Rubin sums up the mood in his speech, which begins with an announcement that the Academy \u201cvoices unconditional support for the people of Ukraine. What a time. OK, welcome to the great tradition of celebrating the Oscars!\u201d he says, and then thanks the 10 zillion sponsors. What a time \u2026 but as long as there are advertisers, the show must go on.\nThere are some notable no-shows \u2013 most notably, The Lost Daughter\u2019s Olivia Colman and The Power of the Dog\u2019s Jane Campion, Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons. Despite that, when Alfred Molina reads out all the nominees\u2019 names to call them up for the mini-group photos, each one getting enthusiastic applause, it takes so long that Stewart turns around to me and asks, massaging her palms, \u201cDon\u2019t your hands hurt?\u201d They do, but I don\u2019t follow her lead in resolving the problem by smacking the backs of my hands together.\nIf one were to predict winners by which nominees get the biggest applause in the room, a betting man would put money on Eilish, Questlove (best documentary feature, Summer of Soul), Aunjanue Ellis (best supporting actress, King Richard) and, most of all, Will Smith (best actor, King Richard). And Smith knows it, pumped with excitement as he jogs up to the photographer, bumping fists with Chastain. Looking at his kingdom, he was finally there, to sit on his throne as the Prince of Bel Air (and Hollywood). Photos done, the lunch finishes, and there is a rush for the door, as everyone frantically seeks out their car and driver to go on to the next event.",

        "content": "From imperial decrees to Sappho\u2019s poems, Ithaca system can find word patterns and suggest age of text\nArtificial intelligence could bring to life lost texts, from imperial decrees to the poems of Sappho, researchers have revealed, after developing a system that can fill in the gaps in ancient Greek inscriptions and pinpoint when and where they are from.\nDr Thea Sommerschield, a co-author of the research at Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice and Harvard University, said inscriptions were important as they were written directly by ancient people and were evidence of the thought, language, society and history of past civilisations.\n\u201cBut most surviving inscriptions have been damaged over the centuries. So their texts are now fragmentary or illegible,\u201d she said, adding that they may also have been moved from their original location, while methods such as radiocarbon dating were unusable on materials such as stone.\nWriting in the journal Nature, Sommerschield and colleagues report how they built an AI system that they nicknamed Ithaca, after the Greek island that was home to the legendary King Odysseus.\nThe team fed Ithaca more than 63,000 transcribed ancient Greek inscriptions, enabling it to pick out patterns in the order of letters and words, as well as associations between words and phrases and the age and provenance of the text.\nThe team then tuned the system before exploring whether it could accurately suggest when and where another 7,811 inscriptions were from, and propose a selection of letters and words to fill in artificially created gaps in the inscriptions, ranked by probability.\nThe results reveal that Ithaca achieved 62% accuracy when used alone to fill in the gaps in inscriptions, and 72% accuracy when the system\u2019s suggestions were interpreted by a historian \u2013 about three times higher than when historians worked alone. The team said Ithaca was able to date the inscriptions to within 30 years of their established date and correctly identified their provenance 71% of the time.\n\u201cJust as microscopes and telescopes have extended the range of what scientists can do today, Ithaca aims to singularly augment and expand the capabilities to study one of the most significant periods of human history,\u201d said Dr Yannis Assael, a co-author of the work from the AI company DeepMind.\nThe team said the approach could be used for any medium and any ancient written language, from Latin to Cuneiform, and it might be possible to train the system on Greek literary texts written on fragments of papyrus \u2013 an approach that could shed light on the writings of poets such as Sappho. There is also the potential to develop AI systems that could provide insights into the authorship of texts.\nThe researchers said Ithaca had already been used on a set of decrees most of which were found on the Acropolis of Athens,suggesting one \u2013 relating to the collection of tributes across the Athenian empire \u2013 dated to 424BC rather than 448-7BC as was long thought, chiming with recent dating breakthroughs.\n\u201cAlthough it might seem like a small difference, this 30-year shift has momentous repercussions for our understanding of the political history of classical Athens, and helps us better align literary sources \u2013 such as Thucydides\u2019 account of these years and events\u2013 with the epigraphic record,\u201d said Sommerschield.\nProf Peter Liddel, an expert in Greek history and epigraphy at the University of Manchester who was not involved in the research, said even the provenance of many of the marbles brought back by Lord Elgin was unclear.\n\u201cThe application of AI through Ithaca certainly has the potential to contribute to the toolbox of historians involved in analysing ancient texts and using them to understand processes like the development of imperialism or the nature of cult activity,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Liddel warned that, like scholars, AI was limited by gaps in the ancient record. \u201cAI is only powerful as a tool to help us ask questions about, and make comparisons to, the existing evidence,\u201d he said.\nProf Melissa Terras, an expert in digital cultural heritage at the University of Edinburgh, said it was important to keep training scholars in traditional approaches to be able to develop AI systems such as Ithaca, and to interpret the suggestions they generate. But she said there was huge potential for AI to assist with interpretation of the past and its cultures given ancient texts were often fragmented yet followed structured formats.\n\u201cThis means they require a lot of cross-referencing for the human brain to solve the puzzle \u2013 but this is the type of repetitive calculation that [AI systems such as] deep neural nets excel at,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Defence secretary says Ukraine desperately seeking more arms as Russian forces try to circle Kyiv\nBritain is planning to supply Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons and \u201ca small consignment\u201d of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine as Russian forces close in on Kyiv to the east, the defence secretary has said.\nThe UK would also continue to supply NLAW short-range anti-tank weapons, Ben Wallace told the Commons, and has already given Ukraine 3,615 of the portable missile systems \u2013 nearly double the 2,000 figure previously disclosed.\nWallace said Ukraine had already received \u201c900 man-portable anti-air missiles\u201d \u2013 a reference to Stingers supplied by other Nato countries \u2013 but was desperately seeking more arms as Russian forces attempted to encircle Kyiv.\n\u201cThe capability needs strengthening,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cSo in response to Ukrainian requests, the government has taken a decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles.\u201d\nLater, in response to questions from MPs as to how long the supply decision would take, Wallace said: \u201cWe are in principle going to do it.\u201d He acknowledged Ukrainian soldiers would need to be trained in how to use the missiles. \u201cHow we are doing it [training] is sensitive,\u201d he added.\nStarstreak is the British army\u2019s equivalent to the better known US-made Stinger ground-to-air missiles that have been supplied to Ukraine by the US, Germany and the Netherlands among others since the Russian invasion. They are laser-guided with a range of 7km (unlike Stingers, which rely on infrared) and are designed to be harder to jam.\nBoth Labour and the SNP urged Wallace to send the Starstreak and other missiles promptly. John Healey, Labour\u2019s shadow defence secretary, called for the supply decision to be made \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. A near identical plea followed from the SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald.\n\u201cThis is only still week two,\u201d Healey said. \u201cRussia has such crushing firepower. Putin has such utter ruthlessness that we must expect more than one of his military objectives to be taken over the next few weeks.\u201d\nWallace told MPs that \u201cthe estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured now stands at over 1,000\u201d and that \u201cthe true figure is expected to be much higher\u201d. British funding to Ukraine would increase to \u00a3220m, of which \u00a3120m would be humanitarian aid, the minister said.\nPeople had been \u201cwithout power and water for almost a week\u201d in the south-eastern city of Mariupol, while unguided bombs had been dropped on Chernihiv, to the north-east of Kyiv, Wallace added. Russian forces were trying to encircle Kyiv, moving troops into the capital\u2019s eastern Brovary suburb.\nThe minister was also pressed on if he would support Poland supplying its 28 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the Conservative bankbencher John Baron asking whether such an agreement would not represent a dangerous escalation of western involvement against Russia. \u201cA wider war would not serve the interests of any population,\u201d the MP said.\nIn reply, Wallace said the decision was a matter for Poland, it was up to Warsaw to consider if it was a calibrated response to the crisis: \u201cIf the Polish government feels the security threat is so acute that it requires itself to do that, then I would fully understand their decision and stand by them.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, an apparent deal to send the MiGs to Ukraine via the US collapsed when the Pentagon said: \u201cWe do not believe Poland\u2019s proposal is a tenable one.\u201d Poland had not wanted to send the jets directly for fear of provoking the Kremlin.\nDiscussions about a possible supply of the fighter jets continued, the US said, although Wallace said in an earlier answer to McDonald he was not directly involved in those talks.",

I can\u2019t really articulate it, it just feels awful. We\u2019ve had this date ahead of us, everyone\u2019s lives are on hold and we\u2019re holding our breath to finally get this report,\u201d said Rhiannon Davies, whose daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died under the care of the trust shortly after she was born in 2009.\n\u201cPeople have booked time off work because emotionally it\u2019s a huge thing. Treating the families like this, and treating Donna like this after all the work she\u2019s done, it\u2019s just disrespectful.\u201d\nDavies and her partner Richard Stanton have campaigned for the review for years alongside Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths, whose daughter Pippa died in 2016 after contracting an infection during birth.\nIn a written statement to parliament on Tuesday, the patient safety minister, Maria Caulfield, said the NHS is in the process of securing indemnity cover for potential legal action following the publication of the report.\nDavies said many families were sceptical about the reasons behind the delay. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to be a very damning report and there are a lot of people squirming in positions of power at the moment. This delay will not prevent the truth from coming out, no matter what the reason is behind it,\u201d Davies said.\n\u201cAll the families have been, in effect, psyching ourselves up for what we would finally hear on that day,\u201d said Charlotte Cheshire, whose 10-year-old son Adam was left with severe disabilities after staff failed to administer antibiotics for seven hours when he caught an infection during birth.\n\u201cAll the families involved in this inquiry, either their children have died or they\u2019ve been dreadfully injured and left disabled. These are big, emotional situations that we\u2019re dealing with. This report has been years in the making, everyone has had time to make the arrangements that needed to be made.\n\u201cThis delay leaves us angry, disappointed, upset and triggers the grief all over again.\u201d\nThe review was commissioned by health secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2017 to examine an initial 23 cases. Ockenden\u2019s interim report, published in December 2020, uncovered a pattern of failures at the trust, including a lethal reluctance to conduct caesarean sections and a tendency to blame mothers for problems.\n\u201cMy son\u2019s birthday is next week, he would have been seven. That\u2019s seven years without a sorry from the hospital,\u201d said Hayley Matthews, whose son Jack Burn died 11 hours after he was born in 2015.\n\u201cYou want justice for your own, but you also want change. I can\u2019t bring my son back, but hopefully this review will help other families, stop it from happening again. But until we see this report, everyone is in the dark.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Ockenden review said: \u201cWe have been informed that a number of parliamentary processes are required before the final report can be published in parliament. The Department of Health and Social Care are working to have these arrangements in place so we can publish the report at the earliest opportunity. These parliamentary processes are completely beyond the control of the review team.\u201d\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to getting the families the answers they deserve and our sympathies remain with all those affected. \u201cWe continue to work with the Ockenden review team and NHS England and NHS Improvement to ensure the final report is published at the earliest opportunity.\u201d",

        "content": "Scott Morrison brings his signature crisis characteristics \u2013 passivity and blame-shifting \u2013 to Lismore\nScott Morrison was prepared to acknowledge some realities when he arrived in Lismore on Wednesday.\nAustralia was becoming a harder country to live in because of natural disasters, like the black summer bushfires, and the latest catastrophic floods that have killed more than 20 people. \u201cWe are dealing with a different climate to the one we are dealing with before,\u201d the prime minister said.\nMorrison turned up with practical support. Cash. Promises of more defence personnel to clear out the rubbish (although that might take a month). He also opened the door on a conversation about what might need to be done locally to mitigate risk, with commonwealth funds on standby.\nBut there was also plenty of passivity and blame-shifting, which are Morrison\u2019s core crisis characteristics.\nWe\u2019ve seen these same instincts flare during the bushfires, during the pandemic and now during the floods. These qualities are now very familiar. It\u2019s part of the reason the prime minister has lost standing with voters.\nOn Wednesday, Morrison thought any inquiry into the quality of the disaster response in the northern rivers was a matter for the New South Wales government \u2013 not him.\nMorrison also thought a failure to scramble significant defence resources into the disaster zone was not actually a failure. The problem was people had unrealistic expectations about what governments could do. The prime minister noted people would always need to rely on their neighbours when catastrophe struck as opposed to a functioning triple zero emergency service (that the Morrison government most decidedly did not run \u2013 that was Dominic Perrottet\u2019s responsibility).\nThere was also the odd business of the emergency declaration. Morrison\u2019s office made it known earlier in the day he was going to make the declaration, but it later emerged he couldn\u2019t until the states were formally on board, because that\u2019s how the legislation (that his own government drafted and passed) actually worked.\nBut all of this was warm-up laps for peak passivity.\nAs might have been predicted, Morrison hit peak passivity when pressed about his government\u2019s record on the climate crisis.\nMorrison pretended the Coalition had always been on board with climate change despite the voluminous evidence to the contrary (including, but not limited to, the repeal of a functioning carbon price, Tony Abbott\u2019s serious attempt to gut the renewable energy target, and, more recently, Morrison\u2019s own hyper-partisan masterstroke, the entirely bogus \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d).\nMorrison suggested his government had been so forward leaning on climate action it had been \u201cthe first government to commit by net zero by 2050\u201d.\nGiven Australia was one of the last countries in the developed world to actually make that commitment, and almost didn\u2019t because of trenchant opposition from the National party \u2013 this first-cab-off-the-rank data point was perplexing to say the least.\nBut in any case, lest all this forward leaning seem too forward, Morrison wrenched his bus into reverse. The prime minister proceeded to treat onlookers to one of his favourite tutorials: Australia makes bugger all difference when it comes to global climate action.\nWe need to remind ourselves that this self-serving pontification by Morrison was occurring at the site of an actual disaster zone on the frontline of the climate crisis, while the traumatised residents of Lismore were milling outside still trying to process what the hell just happened.\nCarry on Lismore. Truly. Don\u2019t mind us.\nSure, global heating was real enough, but Morrison reminded people Australia was an emissions minnow, and nothing would stop global emissions rising until countries with rising emissions profiles were given access to technology enabling them to cut pollution. Anything else was just \u201cwarm fuzzy feelings\u201d.\nThis version of events \u2013 one that pretends demonstrable public policy failure has no costs or consequences \u2013 glosses over inconvenient truths like if runaway heating is a global problem (and it is), it can only be solved by rich countries like Australia pulling their weight. If every country acted with the abject derangement that Australia has exhibited for a decade, then the planet will most decidedly cook.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAnother fact. Australia continues to export emissions that contribute to heating to the rest of the world like that ain\u2019t no thing. One last fact. While Morrison was acknowledging the reality of the changing climate in Lismore, his energy minister, Angus Taylor, was out making the case for a further expansion of fossil fuels, and taunting European countries for not pursuing a \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d.\nThis leads us to the nub of the problem.\nAustralia has struggled to get its disaster response right in part because federations are always complicated and imperfect beasts, and in part, because the Morrison government refuses to pull hard on the thread that will unravel the Coalition\u2019s whole climate culture war.\nGetting the national disaster response right requires something radical.\nIt requires the Coalition to be honest about the past, and about the future.\nTo give Australians the tools they need to manage the existential threat of a heating climate, this government needs to be honest, first with itself, and then with the Australian public, about the nature of the threat. It needs to end a decade of excuses, evasions and obfuscations, and set about atoning for them.\nUntil this government understands the magnitude of its own policy failures, until it can permit the most basic truth telling, this group of people will not be able to summon the imagination or the resolve, let alone the monumental whole-of-federation resources required to mitigate the risks and adapt to the new realities.\nThat\u2019s the truth.",

It\u2019s like a war zone.\u201d\nWhan described the joint state and commonwealth response as a \u201cbig monster with no heads\u201d.\n\u201cThe disorganisation and lack of communication and coordination is beyond belief let alone the financial side of things,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s causing a lot of emotional stress \u2026 people are homeless. Right now, people need cash in their pocket, they\u2019ve literally got nothing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a morale boost more than anything. They had the 2017 record breaking flood, the drought, bushfires, the pandemic, border closures, now this. They don\u2019t have anything left.\u201d\nThe additional weekly disaster recovery payments will be automatically paid for individuals in the \u201ccatastrophe zones\u201d that have already received initial funding. They will be made from 15 and 22 March.\nEligible adults will receive $3,000 in total with children to get $1,200.\nThe federal MP for Richmond, Justine Elliot, said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201castounding\u201d the prime minister had excluded three nearby shires still reeling after devastating floods.\nHer electorate covers Tweed and Richmond in the north and Byron and parts of Ballina in the south.\nThe electorate of Page covers the rest of Ballina, Lismore and the Richmond Valley, and has been held by Nationals MP Kevin Hogan since 2013.\nElliot said \u201cthousands\u201d of people in her electorate lacked access to a home, food or money.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big humanitarian crisis,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really insulting we don\u2019t get that [extra money], we definitely need \u2026 much more than what they\u2019ve put forward, it is really dire and it\u2019s been a complete failure of the state and federal government.\n\u201cWe have people here with nowhere to live. It\u2019s quite frankly disgusting.\u201d\nElliot said the floods had destroyed homes and businesses from Tweed heads down to Ballina, yet some of her constituents still hadn\u2019t received the initial disaster payment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people that have had difficulties if they don\u2019t have identification, which is just crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government is making it so hard. Our most urgent need is housing, food and money. A lot of people have been very distressed.\u201d\nJUST IN: Scott Morrison has announced that Ballina, Byron and Tweed Shire residents will NOT be able to access the federal government\u2019s additional disaster payments.This is an outrage and I am calling for this to be extended to ALL of us.#auspol #Floods2022\nThe deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, told ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Wednesday evening he didn\u2019t think \u201cfor one second\u201d payments were being withheld from certain electorates because of the way they voted.\n\u201cObviously Lismore, from media reports alone, has been an epicentre, not just for the area, but for the nation,\u201d Joyce said.\n\u201cI find it obnoxious people would infer \u2026 a Labor person would not look after a National seat or Nationals would not look after a Labor seat.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t die because of grants. People are not homeless because of grants. This is about an emergency and we don\u2019t go through and say we\u2019ll save this person\u2019s life but not that person\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe Byron shire council mayor, Michael Lyon, said he hadn\u2019t seen the details of the funding, but the shire was facing \u201cmajor infrastructure issues\u201d that would cost upwards of $100m to repair.\n\u201cMany of our community have lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe initial package isn\u2019t enough so I\u2019m surprised we aren\u2019t included in this.\u201d\nFlood ruined carpet, bedding, clothing, carpet, white goods and cars line our streets. Mullumbimby pic.twitter.com/EXhCJkezqK\nThe Tweed council mayor, Chris Cherry, said leaving out Tweed and neighbouring Byron and Ballina from additional support could only be \u201can honest mistake\u201d.\n\u201cWe look forward to the prime minister visiting our affected communities as soon as he can to see the sheer devastation of our shire for himself,\u201d Cherry said.\n\u201cWe may not have received the national coverage other regions have, but many thousands of homes were inundated and we have lost two community members in the disaster.\n\u201cThe damage to our roads and infrastructure is catastrophic and will take years to recover with an excessive damage bill.\u201d\nLocals took to social media to express their outrage at missing out despite losing their homes and livelihoods.\n\u201cThere are still so many waiting for the original payment to be processed, so far it\u2019s a lot of empty promises,\u201d one person wrote on Facebook. \u201cAbsolutely a kick in the guts for these people who have lost everything,\u201d another said.\nOn Wednesday Morrison declared a national emergency covering the severe weather and flooding across New South Wales and Queensland.\nThe power to make the declaration was introduced after the Black Summer bushfires to minimise bureaucracy when recovering from an extreme event.\nThe federal government has paid out $385.2m in disaster payments to 330,900 people in NSW and Queensland during the current floods crisis.\nOne Lismore resident who talked with the prime minister when he visited the flood-stricken area said people had been too harsh regarding the government response.\nMorrison, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, Senator Bridget McKenzie and local member Kevin Hogan visited Paul Weir and his family who lost about 150 cows in the floods. Reporters were not invited.\nOther locals were angry they didn\u2019t get to see the PM but Weir said many were \u201cunjustifiable critics\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go against my community but realistically it was beyond any other flood we had in history. There\u2019s nothing we could have done or could have prepared, realistically, for what\u2019s happened,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nSome in the community have questioned why it took nine days for Morrison to declare the situation a national emergency. Many had to be rescued by local volunteers.\nBut Weir said his meeting with Morrison \u201cwas actually really good\u201d.\n\u201cThe first thing he asked was how I was going as a person, at times like this it is tough,\u201d Weir said.\n\u201cThere was no media, just a private meeting with them and my immediate family. We could have a good discussion to put our views to them and say what happened to us and what we can see in our community.\n\u201cI certainly did feel heard. I really did appreciate them taking their time out of their busy schedule with myself and my family.\u201d",

        "content": "Rapid rise in Covid cases in Western Australia recorded over past week but experts say lack of severity means vaccination is effective\nCovid cases are rising again in several Australian states, most rapidly in Western Australia, though the spike there has not been accompanied by a rise in severe disease.\nWA has recorded 29,839 total cases over the pandemic, but 17,641 of those were recorded in just the last seven days. Meanwhile New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory have also reported a rise in cases over the past week, though much less steep.\nDr Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller and epidemiologist with Monash University in Melbourne, said the rises were unsurprising. In WA, testing rates are strong. But despite the rising case numbers, no one is in intensive care.\n\u201cThere is data that says infection-inquired immunity is strong in places like NSW and Victoria, and that exposure gives you protection,\u201d Lydeamore said.\n\u201cThere were certainly stories of people in NSW getting 15 close contact notifications a week from the check-in app. WA hasn\u2019t had that level of exposure to the virus. They\u2019re relying only on vaccine protection which is good, but they\u2019re also slightly behind on their general vaccine program, including the rollout of boosters.\n\u201cThere is also no lockdown in WA. I\u2019m not suggesting they should have one, but most other places had strict restrictions when cases took off.\n\u201cSo I am not surprised by the spike in numbers, but the important thing is that these cases aren\u2019t translating into a big increase in people getting severe disease [and] requiring hospital care or worse. That speaks to vaccine success.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAs for rises in other states, Lydeamore said a combination of factors were working together such as: a return to school; the growing prevalence of BA.2, a more infectious sub-variant of Omicron which is also increasing in WA; and more movement generally as restrictions ease and people return to offices.\nAcross the country, there has also been a sharp rise of 10 to 19-year-olds with Covid-19, with cases in this age group comprising over 20% of all infections in recent days. The return to schools was driving this, not just in terms of spread, but because states and territories have rapid-antigen testing programs and other requirements in place for schools, which mean more cases in young people are being detected.\nWhile the compulsory RAT program in NSW has been dropped, RAT testing kits are still being offered to families who want them.\n\u201cThe probability of detecting cases in children is now much higher,\u201d Lydeamore said.\nThere have also been rises in cases in specific local government areas in Melbourne, bucking the trend of declining case numbers in most areas.\nMelbourne reported 485 cases in the last seven days compared with 311 in the previous seven. Eastern and south-eastern suburbs reported similar trends, including Boroondara, which rose to 538 cases in the past seven days compared with 401 cases the week prior, Stonnington which jumped to 281 cases from 194, and Glen Eira where cases jumped to 581 from 443.\n\u201cAll of those areas are fairly affluent, which is associated with more travel and movement,\u201d Lydeamore said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible now that travel overseas is available people are also bringing Covid back. The other thing, of course, is that there are also a large number of people who were working from home in those suburbs, and now they\u2019re not. And workplaces are a great place for transmission.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Victorian department of health said case numbers fluctuate for a variety of reasons including increased movement associated with more people returning to work and attending school.\n\u201cThis is the first time the number of Covid-19 cases in hospital in Victoria has been below 200 since 16 September last year,\u201d they said.\nNSW recorded 13,179 positive test results on Wednesday, with the Western Sydney and Northern Sydney local health districts recording the highest number of cases.",

        "content": "Teams with true designs on lifting the premiership trophy probably number six at best and likely just three \nThe philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once said that hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man. Nietzsche would not have coped well in rugby league and certainly not on the eve of a new season where hope is at its high watermark.\nIn a game whose narrative is often beset by negativity and narkiness, the last days before a new campaign kicks off are often the last days of optimism and, arguably, the NRL has never been more optimistic about a season.\nRugby league playing states seem to be moving towards the new norm of Covid. Restrictions are gone. Teams \u2013 the Warriors are the only exception at this stage \u2013 will play at home in front of fans. Financial figures released show the NRL in the most secure, stable position in its history with revenue up 37% and cash reserves up by $45m. Rule tinkering has been kept at a minimum and the one notable change \u2013 awarding a penalty rather than a six-again for a deliberate penalty on an attacker coming out of their own half \u2013 has been met with near-universal relief.\nWith all teams level on the ladder and an entire season to play out, it is not just the increase in club grants by 5% that has even the least realistic of clubs clinging to even the flimsiest reed of hope.\nThe Broncos have put their faith in Ben Ikin to rebuild the club\u2019s list and with Adam Reynolds, Kurt Capewell and Ryan James in his first class there is a belief their leadership should lift the club back into the top eight after going 10-34 for two bottom three finishes the last two years.\nThe Bulldogs, fresh out of a half-decade of salary cap hell, have made it rain for a long list of recruits headed by premiership winner Matt Burton and rep star Josh Addo-Carr. Reputations held little sway with the likes of Paul Vaughan, Tevita Pangai Jnr and Brent Naden all looking for some kind of redemption after off-field incidents. Trent Barrett will need to meld together the team quickly though to get off the hottest of coaching seats.\nThe Raiders look to be ushering in a new generation. The Cowboys are on bended knee hoping their halves investment pays off. The Dragons are up-and-about on the back of a dominant Charity Shield win. The Titans project as big improvers as the club continues to build under highly promising coach Justin Holbrook.\nNo team from the bottom half of the ladder has more reason for hope though than Cronulla. The Sharks made huge waves when they snagged highly-rated assistant Craig Fitzgibbon early last season and it certainly resonated with those off-contract with big names Nicho Hynes and Dale Finucane both joining the club. Cronulla view themselves as genuine title contenders with not only the talent but the cultural changes the former Storm duo bring.\nThe genuine title contenders probably number at best six and likely just three. The hope at South Sydney, Parramatta and Manly is certainly there but where will they find the lift to elevate them that next step or three? None of the trio have improved their rosters. Souths have lost the most successful coach the game has ever known as well as their organising half and now rookie halfback Lachlan Ilias shoulders the burden. The Eels have a roster very similar to that of recent years that has thrived in the regular season and shot blanks in the finals. Manly are hoping for a repeat of Tom Trbojevic\u2019s magical 2021.\nWhen it comes to true designs on lifting that premiership trophy, the three teams that hold the aces are Penrith, Melbourne and the Sydney Roosters \u2013 coached by the three best mentors in the game.\nThe Panthers will need to defy nearly all recent history to go back-to-back and ride their golden generation to another title. Penrith\u2019s depth has taken a hit and they will start their season with star Nathan Cleary on the sidelines but there is no questioning the talent on their list.\nThe Roosters were arguably the unluckiest \u2013 and most courageous \u2013 team of 2021 and with even a fair injury run in 2022 will be right in contention. Trent Robinson is among the game\u2019s best thinkers and with decent health combined with the experience gained from so much young talent last year it is more than conceivable to see the Tricolours back in the grand final for the third time in five years.\nNo team enters the season more stung than the Storm. Craig Bellamy\u2019s team were historic in their brilliance in 2021, breaking a tremendous number of attacking records while maintaining their classic defensive fortress. It all slipped away though during a forgettable 80-minute semi-final showing against Penrith. Redemption has historically been a major driver for the Storm and will be at the crux of their push for another title.\nCome Monday, it will all be different. As it sits though, with the first match still yet to be played, hope washes over all and the unusual feeling of optimism looms large over the game.",

        "content": "Norway\u2019s largest pension fund KLP also excludes Israeli defence contractor, Elbit, from its portfolio\nThe Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems has denied producing cluster munitions after two big investment funds banned investment in the company, saying it was involved with the weapons.\nCluster munitions are outlawed under Australian law and an international treaty because of their devastating effect on civilians.\nBoth Australia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the $200bn Future Fund, and Norway\u2019s largest pension fund, the $136bn KLP, have banned investment in Elbit over its alleged association with certain weapons.\nCluster munitions, which were allegedly used by Russian forces during the invasion of Ukraine, are bombs that contain smaller bomblets that scatter as they drop from the air.\nUnder an international convention they are banned by 110 states, including Australia, because they kill and maim civilians and because, like landminesthey can remain a deadly hazard years after a conflict is over. Israel is not a signatory.\nGovernment tender data shows that Elbit, which employs the former minister for defence Christopher Pyne as a lobbyist, is a major supplier to the Australian defence force, winning more than $1.8bn of work since 2007. This includes a controversial battle management system, designed to keep commanders in touch with troops in the field. The army last year ordered troops to stop using the system amid reports of security fears among soldiers. Elbit has consistently denied there are any security issues with its system.\n\u201cThe June 2021 Senate Estimates, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee heard from the Department of Defence and Australian Signals Directorate there have been no security issues with our software,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nElbit has also repeatedly denied making cluster munitions since 2018, when it took over IMI Systems, formerly known as Israeli Military Industries, which previously produced the weapons.\nIn its public declaration of excluded companies, the Future Fund lists Elbit Systems as one of eight firms barred from investment because of \u201cexclusions related to military weapons-related Conventions or Treaties ratified by Australia\u201d.\nThe Future Fund declined to explain in detail why it last year excluded Elbit from investment, with a spokesperson saying the decision was based on data that could not be passed on to Guardian Australia because it was the intellectual property of a third-party information provider company.\nBut in a report released in November, KLP said it was excluding Elbit Systems from its investments because \u201cit is clear that the company produces cluster munitions\u201d.\nIn its report, KLP provided details, including model numbers of the cluster munitions it claims Elbit produces through IMI Systems. These include \u201cminiature intelligent multipurpose submunitions\u201d, which are \u201ca smart cluster munitions system equipped with sensors to program and identify targets\u201d, as well as conventional munitions that each contain dozens of bomblets, KLP said.\nKLP\u2019s head of responsible investments, Kiran Aziz, told Guardian Australia the fund got much of its information about Elbit from MSCI, an American financial information provider. \u201cIn addition, we use publicly available information from NGOs and what a company reports,\u201d she said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nAsked why KLP did not believe Elbit\u2019s denials of involvement in cluster munitions, she said: \u201cWe relied on information we have from MSCI as our data provider which is quite updated.\u201d\nHowever, she said KLP did not claim that Elbit produced the bomblet that sits inside the cluster munitions systems it allegedly produces.\n\u201cElbit was already excluded due to a violation of our criterion of human rights violations for their involvement in the occupied Palestinian territory,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey have now also been excluded under our criterion of involvement in controversial weapons. The reason why we exclude companies with reference to several criteria when they have already been excluded, is that all the reasons are important to state, and that we do not want to risk the companies being included in the portfolio again if the first exclusion basis ceases.\u201d\nIn a 15 February letter, provided by Elbit to Guardian Australia, the company\u2019s chief legal officer and executive vice president, Jonathan Ariel, said Elbit \u201chas never been engaged in the production or sale of cluster munitions\u201d.\n\u201cFollowing the acquisition of IMI Systems Ltd in 2018, Elbit Systems discontinued all activities of IMI relating to IMI\u2019s legacy cluster munitions,\u201d he said.\nHe said the company, including IMI, complied with the international convention banning cluster munitions.\nRawan Arraf, executive director of Australian Centre for International Justice, said the Future Fund was right to be concerned about Elbit\u2019s alleged association with cluster munitions but that it should also be concerned about its supply of the surveillance systems and other products and services used by Israeli authorities, which she says amounts to aiding and abetting serious human rights abuses against the Palestinian people.\n\u201cThere is a major incongruity when an Australian public agency rightly excludes Elbit Systems, yet Australian state and federal governments happily enter into lucrative contractual agreements with it.\u201d\nThe defence department did not respond to detailed questions about its dealings with Elbit.\nPyne and his lobbying company, Pyne & Partners, declined to comment.",

It\u2019s going great guns.\u201d\nFor only \u00a35, customers can own an A4-sized slice of the 19-year-old fabric. Big spenders can take home a framed and engraved piece for \u00a350.\nBuyers can even order a piece of carpet from a specific place in the club, including outside the toilet, below the bar or the well-worn fray at the edge of the dancefloor.\nProceeds from the sale will go to the local Street Angels charity, which carries out night-time patrols in Halifax to check on the welfare of drinkers.\nJackson, 55, said he had been inundated with emails from patrons who have a special connection to a specific part of the Acca.\nOne person got in touch to say they had scattered their grandmother\u2019s ashes in the club, he said, while others have pointed to the exact spot where they first met their partner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got some history there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the oldest club in the country and it\u2019s probably the oldest carpet in the country. The carpet is probably older than some of our customers.\u201d\nThe Acca has enjoyed a loyal fanbase in West Yorkshire for decades, remaining popular when competition from superclubs, festivals and cheap foreign holidays have seen hundreds of other nightclubs go to the wall.\nWhile many are no doubt drawn to its special offers \u2013 75p drinks before 11pm and free entry for the first 200 revellers \u2013 its popularity is also due to its place in local history.\nJackson, who first worked at the club in the 1980s and became its owner in 1995, said he hoped the carpet sale would raise \u00a33,000 for charity and put a spring in people\u2019s step: \u201cI suppose with the rest of the news going on it will just make people smile.\u201d",

While your editorial (6 March) is correct, it highlights issues that have been around since I started. Regularly, improvements and revisions made in children\u2019s homes are overturned as the next round of spending cuts arrives. From the passing of the Children Act in 1989 until the early 2000s, there was some progress. We now seem to be reversing many of the strides that have been made, taking money from young people looked after by the state to assist in cutting taxes for the more fortunate.\nYou also highlight the scandals that have covered a range of issues from child abuse to financial abuse, all of which mean that children in care suffer more neglect rather than compensation for that which they have already suffered. This is often reflected in the behaviour of these young people, who then gain a negative public image which many politicians feel justifies not investing in them. Some young people cared for by the state may now receive little support beyond ages 15 or 16.\nIt is not a system that needs tweaking or simply more money, but restructuring in such a way that reflects normal family care and support as much as possible, and then, as you say, tough regulation to ensure it is happening.Roy GrimwoodMarket Drayton, Shropshire\n That most children\u2019s homes are run by profit-seeking companies is scandalous. Numerous inquiries have highlighted the failures of our care system for children, and in 2015 David Cameron called for a \u201croot and branch\u201d review, but still there\u2019s been no real improvement.\nResidential care continues to be an amateur service. If you appear to be reasonably caring and unlikely to abuse your charges, you can get a job. GPs have to complete at least four years of training, a solicitor six years, and the vet who treats your dog has a five-year qualification. Yet our most vulnerable children are cared for by people who are not required to have any previous relevant training.\nKindness and common sense alone cannot address the distressing problems that children in homes exhibit. Few have a plan to treat the reasons they are in the home, and, if they do, it is unlikely to be fully implemented. Few even receive regular sessions with a qualified counsellor. The annual cost for one child averages up to \u00a3200,000, yet half of prisoners under the age of 25 have been in care. Figures for mental illness and homelessness are equally grim. Ownership and regulation of homes needs to be addressed, but will not solve their continuing failure to meet the needs of the children they exist to serve. I still await \u201croot and branch\u201d reform. Mel WoodSwords, County Dublin, Ireland\n Yes, care standards must be raised, but the systemic failures of England\u2019s care system are much deeper than just the role of private providers. The alarming example of Robert McGuinness (Report, 3 March) is one symptom of a care system in crisis. And it\u2019s in crisis partly because of decades of underinvestment in children\u2019s social care, which has enabled unacceptable levels of instability for children in and leaving care (7,230 children moved placement more than three times in 2021).\nThe Independent Review of Children\u2019s Social Care must tackle these root issues boldly in its incoming recommendations. And the government must commit to funding that enables the seismic change that\u2019s desperately needed.Katharine Sacks-JonesCEO, Become \n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

The charges also relate to further works which are alleged to have been carried out by the landowner in December 2021.\nOliver Harmar, the chief operating officer at Natural England, said: \u201cThe decimation of this section of the River Lugg has been devastating to the local environment and to local people, destroying the habitats of iconic wildlife such as otters, kingfisher and salmon. It was heartbreaking to see this beautiful riverside illegally damaged.\u201d\nThe area is protected as an SSSI owing to its importance for nature.

In addition, the devices usually contain charcoal, which is normally not sustainably sourced, leading to deforestation, as well as single-use plastic. They cannot be recycled or composted, meaning that for each one sold in the UK \u2013 where sales are estimated at more than a million each year \u2013 new waste is committed to landfill.\nAldi has stopped selling them, which will save approximately 35 tonnes of single-use waste packaging a year. Liz Fox, corporate responsibility director at Aldi UK, said: \u201cWe are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and know that many of our shoppers are increasingly looking to do the same.\n\u201cWe hope customers can embrace our latest move and still want them to enjoy their summer picnics and barbecues. As an alternative, we would encourage customers to opt for more environmentally friendly and sustainable options such as mini portable barbecues, ensuring they are used responsibly.\u201d\nAll Waitrose stores will stop selling the disposable grills before summer. They estimate this will save about 70,000 disposable barbecues from being sold a year, saving 7.4 tonnes of foil and 1.1 tonnes of shrink-wrap plastic being produced a year.\nLucy Comer, buying assistant at Waitrose, said: \u201cDisposable barbecues present a risk to our natural habitats and this is why we\u2019ve committed to removing them from our shelves this year. This is the right thing to do to preserve our local ecosystems and another example of the work we\u2019re doing to protect the planet. We applaud Aldi for standing with us to make this happen and we hope other retailers will follow.\u201d\nThe government has welcomed the decision. Amanda Craig, director of people and nature at Natural England, said: \u201cWe welcome any step that helps people act more responsibly while enjoying the countryside, and encourage everyone to follow the countryside code when spending time outdoors. This includes only using barbecues in places where signs specify they are permitted, to better protect people, property and wildlife\u201d.\n This article was amended on 10 March 2022. Waitrose estimates that not selling 70,000 disposable barbecues a year would save 7.4 tonnes of foil and 1.1 tonnes of shrink-wrap plastic being produced, not 73.5 and 11.2 tonnes respectively as an earlier version said due to information provided by the company.",

How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?\u201d said Zelenskiy on Telegram.\n\u201cHospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children\u2019s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.\u201d\nAmid western warnings that Moscow\u2019s invasion was about to become even more brutal as the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, seeks to regain stalled momentum, local authorities described the damage to the hospital \u2013 a combined 600-bed complex with children\u2019s and maternity wards \u2013 as \u201ccolossal\u201d and said at least 17 people had been wounded, including women in labour.\nThe deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said the city was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s medieval,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure genocide. The attack isn\u2019t simply treacherous. It\u2019s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.\u201d\nThe Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials\u2019 accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack.\nThe Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as \u201capocalyptic\u201d, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis.\nJournalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food and melting snow for water, while thousands sheltered in basements.\nThe Russian army had also \u201cshot and bombed\u201d a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to.\nUkrainian authorities said earlier the corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an \u201cofficial public commitment\u201d to cease fire.\nThe governor of Sumy, from which 7,000 civilians \u2013 including 1,700 foreign students \u2013 managed to flee on Tuesday, said civilian cars were driving out of the north-eastern city along the same safe route to Poltava, further to the west, with priority for pregnant women, women with children, and elderly and disabled people.\nBut while the mayor of Enerhodar in the north-west said a convoy of mainly vulnerable civilians had been evacuated from the city, and Kyiv\u2019s deputy mayor said authorities hoped to help some more people escape from Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, there was little evidence the corridors were working elsewhere.\nCivilians were unable to evacuate from Izyum because of continued Russian shelling in the eastern Kharkiv region, said the regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, adding that buses intended to evacuate them were still waiting at the entrance to the town.\nZelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was \u201cat the maximum\u201d and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d if it did not.\nHe called the Russians \u201cNazis\u201d in an interview with Sky News, saying: \u201cIf you are united against the Nazis and this terror, you have to close. Don\u2019t wait for me ask you several times, a million times. Close the sky.\u201d He warned that otherwise \u201cmillions\u201d of people could die.\nSpeaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia.\nThe head of the UN\u2019s refugee agency UNHCR, Filippo Grandi, said on Wednesday that up to 2.2 million people had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The head of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme said it expects to have to help more than 3 million refugees from Ukraine with food donations.\nWith food becoming an increasingly urgent concern inside the country, Ukraine\u2019s government on Wednesday banned wheat exports that are critical to global food supplies in an attempt to ward off food shortages and hunger.\nAmid international alarm over the safety of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear plants, several of which are now in Russian hands, Kyiv called for a ceasefire to allow the electricity supply to be restored to Chernobyl, saying the defunct plant had been disconnected from the grid. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had attacked power lines in a \u201cdangerous provocation\u201d.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), however, said the loss of power at the plant did not have an imminent impact on safety \u2013 although it said it was very concerned about the lack of staff rotation at the plant, which requires constant management to prevent another nuclear disaster.\nAs fighting continued across the country, Ukraine\u2019s general staff said on Wednesday its armed forces were building up defences in cities in the north, south and east, and that forces around Kyiv were \u201cholding the line\u201d and resisting an apparently stalled Russian offensive with unspecified strikes.\nThe British Ministry of Defence said in its latest assessment of the military situation that fighting north-west of Kyiv was \u201congoing\u201d and Russian forces were \u201cfailing to make any significant breakthroughs\u201d.\nThe ministry\u2019s assessment said the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol \u201cremain encircled and continue to suffer heavy Russian shelling\u201d. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Russia\u2019s assault was about to become \u201cmore brutal and more indiscriminate\u201d.\nThe UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion.\nThree rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must \u201cdemilitarise\u201d and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at ensuring Russia\u2019s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation.\nThe foreign ministry in Moscow repeated allegations the US was supporting a military biological programme in Ukraine involving deadly pathogens including plague, cholera and anthrax, claiming Russian forces had uncovered evidence of the alleged programme. Washington and Kyiv have strongly denied the claims, which the US has previously described as \u201cabsurd\u201d misinformation.\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, and the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, on the sidelines of a summit being hosted on Wednesday in the resort city of Antalya by Turkey, a Nato member.\nRussia said on Wednesday that it was working on a \u201cbroad response\u201d to an unprecedented range of international financial and economic sanctions that appear certain to plunge Russia\u2019s economy into its gravest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.",

However, he added by that time \u201c60% of the money had already gone out of the door\u201d.\nHe recalled: \u201cI was writing letters of congratulations to Border Force staff for picking up suitcases of cash leaving the country. It was happy days if you were a crook in those first few months.\u201d\nOut of a potential 100,000 fraud cases, Agnew said just 49 had resulted in arrest \u2013 a figure he branded a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\nHe claimed the economic crime bill, passed by MPs on Monday, was a \u201cstart\u201d but only fixed around a quarter of the problems that needed solving in tackling serious offences, such as money laundering.\nAgnew admitted he was \u201cvery worried\u201d that ministers would claim the bill would solve all the issues and warned that would be an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d.\nIn a direct attack on the most senior civil servant in the Treasury \u2013 the department in which Agnew used to be a minister \u2013 he also said that a letter he received from Tom Scholar \u201cembodies everything about the complacency that grips the civil service\u201d.\nIt comes two months after the Treasury confirmed it had written off \u00a34.3bn worth of the \u00a35.8bn of fraud witnessed across its Covid business loan schemes.\nAgnew said he quit because he was asked to defend the move, but decided he \u201ccould not stand up with any great integrity and say that we\u2019d done a great job, because we hadn\u2019t\u201d.\nSpeaking to the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, Agnew said the Back Bounce Loan Scheme was an \u201cimportant intervention\u201d to help keep small and medium-sized firms afloat when tough restrictions were in place that forced them to close.\n\u201cWe had to get the money out quickly to legitimate businesses and give them the support they needed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the fraud side it was just a Dad\u2019s Army operation.\u201d\nAgnew said the economic crime bill \u2013 heralded by the government as a key move to help tackle dirty money being laundered in the UK \u2013 was a start, but added: \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t really be called an economic crime bill, because it\u2019s about tightening up some Land Registry disclosures \u2026\n\u201cThis only deals with probably 25% of what needs to be done. The Companies House situation is simply terrifying \u2013 the gaping holes that exist there in terms of their inability to carry out any proper anti-money-laundering checks on people applying for a company.\u201d\nAgnew also said the head of fraud at the British Business Bank had recently \u201cresigned out of frustration because she was not getting supported\u201d in bids to ensure \u201ca much harder set of reporting standards from the banks\u201d.\nHe also dismissed as \u201ctotal drivel\u201d and a \u201cclassic fob off\u201d explanations by the government about why it would not publish a list of the businesses that received loans.\nThe Treasury has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "Deputy mayor of southern Ukrainian city says people living in \u2018medieval conditions\u2019 after week of continuous shelling\nSpeaking via a blurry video connection, the deputy mayor of Mariupol painted a grim picture of life and death on Wednesday inside his besieged city.\nRussian forces surrounded Mariupol a week ago. They have been shelling it \u201ccontinuously\u201d ever since, Sergiy Orlov said, in a call with the Guardian and other foreign media.\n\u201cThey have used aviation, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, grads and other types of weapons we don\u2019t even know about. This isn\u2019t simply treacherous. It\u2019s a war crime and pure genocide,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cVladimir Putin means to capture Mariupol whatever the human cost.\u201d\nBy way of evidence, Orlov reeled off a list of civilian targets he said had so far been \u201cannihilated\u201d. They included numerous residential houses, Mariupol\u2019s 600-bed maternity hospital No 9, the main administration service building, and the city\u2019s giant Avostal metallurgical factory \u2013 once the workplace for 11,000 people.\nHe said 1,170 people had been killed. On Wednesday, municipal workers buried 47 victims in a mass grave.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t identify all of them,\u201d Orlov said. The message from Moscow was chillingly clear, he suggested: \u201cPutin intends to destroy Ukraine so he can have Ukraine without Ukrainians.\u201d\nPutin\u2019s goals, he said, were proceeding at a terrifying pace. The city has spent the last eight days without heat, power, gas, or electricity. Russians parked up in tanks and armoured vehicles on Mariupol\u2019s coastal outskirts had bombed all 15 power lines, Orlov said. On Monday, they blew up the gas connection.\n\u201cWe sent a team of workers to repair the line. The Russians immediately shelled them. They had to leave,\u201d he said.\nConsequently, the city\u2019s 400,000 residents were living in freezing \u201cmedieval conditions\u201d, unthinkable in what was until two weeks ago a modern and \u201cflourishing\u201d city, with busy cafes and restaurants.\n\u201cThe only way civilians can cook now is on open fires. People are fighting over firewood. They are happy that it\u2019s cold and snowing. Snow means they have something to drink.\u201d\n\u201cA six-year-old girl died of dehydration,\u201d Orlov continued bitterly. \u201cThis is Europe, in 2022. How can that happen?\u201d He added: \u201cA lot of districts are devastated. They are dropping half-tonne bombs from the sky.\u201d\nMariupol is one of several Ukrainian cities where Russia has promised to open so-called humanitarian corridors. The reality was the reverse, Orlov said. For the past five days Russia had shelled the agreed route and had even mined the road. It had set up a new checkpoint, he claimed, making evacuation to Zaporizhzhia \u2013 a city to the west under Ukrainian control \u2013 impossible.\nThe deputy mayor estimated about 200,000 people wanted to get out of Mariupol. The authorities were only able to take out about 2,000 to 3,000 residents a day, he said, on a battered fleet of 21 municipal buses. The Russians had flattened the others. They targeted the assembly evacuation points, with citizens understandably reluctant to leave their shelters.\nPutin\u2019s apparent dream of a \u201cRussian world\u201d minus Ukrainians was the product of a \u201csick imagination\u201d, he said.\nHe pointed out that Mariupol had always been a diverse multicultural city, home to Ukrainian and Russian speakers as well as ethnic Greeks and Armenians. All were Ukrainian citizens, he said, adding that nobody cared what language you spoke.\n\u201cHalf of those killed by Russian bombing are Russian-origin Ukrainians. This is Putin\u2019s \u2018peace\u2019,\u201d he said sardonically. The Ukrainian army would defend Mariupol until the last man, he said. If it did ultimately fall it would become a \u201cghost place\u201d, he predicted, adding: \u201cThere is no Russian Mariupol. It\u2019s going to be a desert.\u201d\nFrom Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted photos of the airstrike on Wednesday at Mariupol\u2019s maternity hospital and said people and children lay buried under the wreckage. The Guardian was unable to verify the allegation, but video published by the Associated Press showed several injured people at the site of the hospital attack.\nZelenskiy renewed his call \u2013 so far denied by Nato \u2013 for an immediate no-fly zone over Ukraine\u2019s skies. The world was \u201closing its humanity\u201d, he wrote.\nMariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital.  People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity. pic.twitter.com/FoaNdbKH5k\nOther photos taken from inside Mariupol over the past two days confirm a humanitarian disaster is taking place, with the EU, the US and the UK seemingly able to do nothing.\nThey show blackened and destroyed apartment buildings, several still smouldering; burnt-out cars; and streets filled with debris. Bodies lay on pavements covered by rugs or sheets.\nLocal authorities still control the city centre. The worst shelling has taken place in western districts closest to Russian troops including Primorskiy and the port area, once home to Ukraine\u2019s small Sea of Azov naval fleet. With little food left, desperate civilians have started looting shops, smashing glass and clambering through windows.\nThe city has distributed bottled water to women and children. Orlov said supplies of formula milk had run out, with about 3,000 babies unfed. Families are sleeping in freezing cellars. A few residents are able to charge mobile phones on city council generators. But for most, contact with the outside world has stopped.\nWriting on Facebook, Mariupol resident Angela Timchenko said there was \u201cno electricity, no communication, no gas, no medical care and no food. Looting is on the rise. There are crazy mums looking for food and nappies. Let\u2019s help each other whenever possible.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cYesterday I was in the city. There were bonfires burning near all the houses and food was being prepared \u2026 to all who left our children to die, burn in hell. I heard a little boy ask his mum: \u2018Will the rockets spark today?\u2019\u201d\nTimchenko said she had lost 3.5kg and was running back and forth from her apartment on the eighth floor of a Mariupol block, where she lived with her family. \u201cThe baby understands if you raise your voice a little we need to run for cover,\u201d she wrote poignantly.\nA few days ago, an activist Anatoliy Lozar had described conditions in Mariupol as \u201chell\u201d. The city had become a new Stalingrad, he said. On Wednesday, calls to his two phones failed to connect. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, said Mariupol was \u201cbesieged by Russian invaders\u201d and in dire need of help.\nRussia continues holding hostage over 400.000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues. Almost 3.000 newborn babies lack medicine and food. I urge the world to act! Force Russia to stop its barbaric war on civilians and babies!\n\u201cMariupol is on the edge of humanitarian catastrophe. No humanitarian convoy can get to the city left without water, heating & electricity,\u201d he tweeted.\nThe humanitarian corridor did function in the north-eastern city of Sumy, where civilians were able to leave for a second day in a row. They were able to exit in private cars. Several hundred international students trapped by the fighting left on Tuesday in buses for Poltava, west of Kharkiv.\nFor those who remained in Sumy conditions were grim. Its mayor Oleksandr Lysenko said since Monday Russia had carried out four indiscriminate bombing raids, which killed civilians and children.\nThe latest attack in the darkness of Wednesday morning targeted a downtown residential area. \u201cWe managed to dig six people out, still alive, and a dog,\u201d Lysenko said.\nTwo convoys had managed to leave on Tuesday and were allowed to go through an enemy cordon. But the Russians used the second convoy as a human shield in order to advance their tanks, he said.\n\u201cThey shoot at civilian cars. Some cars get through, others don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of luck.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThey shoot at civilians trying to flee. The Russians have no humanity.\u201d",

        "content": "Change would mean Ukrainians with temporary visas would be able to bring their relatives to Britain\nMinisters are considering a climbdown to allow Ukrainians with temporary visas to bring relatives to the UK after Ukraine\u2019s ambassador called for an easing of restrictions.\nAmid scenes of chaos and despair at a visa application centre in Poland, government insiders said Ukrainians in the UK on work and student visas might also be allowed to bring their relatives to the UK.\nThe development came hours after Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine\u2019s representative in London, told MPs he planned to ask Priti Patel why Ukrainians on temporary visas were not allowed to invite their family members to join them.\nAt prime minister\u2019s questions, Boris Johnson faced further demands for the government to speed up the system. So far, just 760 UK visas have been granted from a total of 2 million Ukrainians who have fled their homeland.\nAccording to a Whitehall source, the ambassador\u2019s comments prompted a rethink. \u201cThere is movement on people with temporary visas, and the new plans should be released soon,\u201d the Guardian was told.\nIt emerged as police were called on Wednesday to calm \u201cangry\u201d crowds standing in freezing temperatures at a UK application centre in south-east Poland. People trying to apply for visas in Rzesz\u00f3w were seen banging on the centre\u2019s windows after children and elderly people were forced to queue in freezing temperatures.\nPolice were called after staff told the crowds they were only able to process 100 applications a day.\nIn Westminster, Prystaiko told MPs that 100,000 of his citizens could come to Britain to escape the Russian war machine and said he would be \u201chappy\u201d if visa requirements for Ukrainians were lifted.\nIn a damning assessment of the UK\u2019s immigration system, he called for a \u201csimplified\u201d process for refugees fleeing to the UK and disclosed that his own wife had struggled to get a visa before the Russia conflict.\nAsked by members of the home affairs select committee if he would like visa requirements to be waived altogether, in line with moves in the EU, he said: \u201cThat would definitely resolve all the issues, but how reasonable, how justified it is with your own system, that\u2019s frankly for you to decide.\n\u201cWe will be happy if all the barriers are dropped for some period of time when we can get maximum [numbers] of people, then we will deal with that.\u201d\nPrystaiko also called for an easing of the \u201cbureaucratic\u201d processes that were hampering asylum seekers\u2019 attempts to come to the UK.\nHe also addressed the allegations of racism at the borders, as black and Asian students attempted to flee the country.\n\u201cIt has been raised many times. Ukraine is a very homogenic society and not many people with different races on the streets. Foreigners do stick out of the crowd [but] it doesn\u2019t mean we are racist,\u201d he said.\nOn Wednesday evening, David Cameron said the UK should be more generous in allowing Ukrainian refugees to come to Britain. The former prime minister told LBC\u2019s Tonight with Andrew Marr: \u201cLet\u2019s find a way to get it done.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, Johnson was criticised by members of his own party, with one senior Tory calling for a \u201creset\u201d on the government\u2019s approach to the refugee crisis.\nJulian Smith, a Conservative former chief whip, said: \u201cI think people across the country are genuinely concerned about our response on refugees, on the bureaucracy, on the tone of our response.\u201d\nHis comments follow a string of Tory MPs attacking Patel on Tuesday over the government\u2019s chaotic response to the crisis. Thousands of refugees have struggled to book appointments at British visa centres across Europe, with hundreds in Calais unable to cross the border.\nA visa centre being set up 75 miles away in Lille, northern France, to assist Ukrainian refugees will not offer appointments or walk-in access.\nIt has emerged that Patel called Ireland\u2019s justice minister, Helen McEntee, last week to raise concerns that the common travel area could prove to be a back door to Ukrainians and others who wanted to go to the UK.\nIreland, in line with the EU protection programme, has lifted visa requirements for Ukrainians and offered them the right to work and live in the country for up to three years.\nThe taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, told the Irish parliament that McEntee had \u201cpointed out\u201d that Ireland was acting in concert with the EU and that meant waiving visa requirements.\nReacting to the U-turn, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThe government is constantly moving the goalposts for a visa scheme that is simply not suited to respond to an urgent humanitarian crisis. It must adopt an approach that first and foremost treats them as refugees. This means immediately waiving visa requirements.\u201d\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine and we have taken urgent action to process visas at speed for all those eligible to the Ukraine family scheme, while carrying out vital security checks.\n\u201cWe have protected appointments at all of our visa application centres to ensure there is sufficient capacity and deployed extra staff to help people through the process as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cWe are increasing our capacity to meet this demand and will keep it under continuous review and increase further if needed. We have protected appointments for Ukrainians at Rzesz\u00f3w and these are available to book \u2013 so people should book online rather than attempt a walk-in appointment.\u201d",

The Commanders will be taking on the entirety of his deal for the 2022 season, including a $5m roster bonus due next week, according to ESPN.\nIt was not immediately clear what the Commanders sent to the Colts in their latest attempt to find a franchise quarterback. ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter said the teams will exchange second-round picks in this year\u2019s draft, while the Colts will acquire Washington\u2019s third-round selection and a third-rounder in 2023 that can become a second if Wentz plays 70% of the Commanders\u2019 offensive snaps.\nWentz spent one season as the Colts\u2019 quarterback after Indianapolis traded a first- and third-round pick to acquire him in a February 2021 trade with the Philadelphia Eagles.\nHe threw 27 touchdowns, matched a career low in interceptions with seven and appeared to have the Colts in line for a third playoff appearance in four years. But Indianapolis stumbled to back-to-back defeats in their final two regular-season games \u2013 needing only one of them to punch their postseason ticket \u2013 including a dismal 26-11 loss to the lowly Jacksonville Jaguars in their season finale.\nThis will be the sixth consecutive year the Colts will have a different opening day starter, though Jacoby Brissett took over when Andrew Luck missed the entire season in 2017 and again in 2019 when Luck abruptly announced his retirement in August.\nWhile coach Frank Reich urged the Colts to acquire his former Eagles pupil 13 months ago and continued to support Wentz throughout the season and offseason, general manager Chris Ballard was less committed. Last week, Reich told reporters at the NFL scouting combine he needed a quarterback he believed could be a long-term solution \u2013 before quickly explaining that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t believe in Wentz.\nCommanders coach Ron Rivera evidently does believe in Wentz. The move to acquire a former face of an NFC East rival is the once-storied franchise\u2019s latest attempt to shore up a quarterback situation that has been in flux for decades.\nThe move, which cannot be finalized until the start of the new league year next week, came one day after the NFL offseason got into full swing with Aaron Rodgers reportedly agreeing to stay with the Green Bay Packers and longtime Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson heading to the Denver Broncos in a trade.",

News of Kaepernick\u2019s protest ripples through the locker room and on to the field. Still, Chicano star running back Luis Moreno (Sebasti\u00e1n Capit\u00e1n Viveros) is more bothered by his growing fame and fortune than engaging with a \u201cwokeness fashion statement\u201d. That is until the popularity of Donald Trump\u2019s electoral campaign results in his mother\u2019s taco shop being graffitied with the slur \u201cBuild the wall\u201d, when he, too, feels compelled to make a public revolt in support of his community.\nWilkins\u2019 play morphs into a nuanced analysis of different ethnic minorities\u2019 experiences of racism. As Luis\u2019 anger spills out in a camera-flashing press conference, the team\u2019s politically minded defender Ezekiel (Joseph Black) wonders why it has taken him so long to find his voice. \u201cThis protest has been going on for months,\u201d Ezekiel presses, \u201cnow you want to insert yourself right in the middle?\u201d Questions are raised over the right time and space to make a stand, and astute perspective comes as Ezekiel considers how to get \u201cmythical conscientious white folk\u201d on side.\nBut it takes a while to get here. The play\u2019s first half is bloated by marathon set-up scenes that do little to push the pace. Much of the early drama feels like filler and the attempted stylised execution doesn\u2019t come off. There is a sense of stagnation to Nancy Medina\u2019s direction, too. Long pauses are favoured as a technique to build tension. An initially comical moment where the youngest team member, Cre\u2019von (Hayden Mclean), frustratingly packs his bag is stretched so far the audience\u2019s laughs mutate into silence. A pity, as it sucks the vitality that is needed to keep the script moving.\nNevertheless, this is a commendable debut. Carried by a sprightly cast, Wilkins\u2019 writing feels fresh in its focus on racism in sport. He is an emerging talent we can expect to climb the ranks.\nMoreno is at Theatre503, London, until 26 March",

Global outrage rises as Russian military targets civilians in Mariupol, while western officials are warning of \u201cserious concern\u201d that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In Australia, major flooding is continuing in some parts of NSW, and frustrations grow as flood victims miss out on relief payments.\nRussian shelling has \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d a children\u2019s and maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukrainian authorities have said. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called the bombing of the 600-bed complex an \u201catrocity\u201d, and says countless children remain trapped under the rubble. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmitryo Kuleba, accused Russia of \u201cholding 400,000 people hostage\u201d in Mariupol, a city in which continuous shelling has killed more than 1,170 residents in recent days.

Western officials said at a briefing on Wednesday \u201cwe\u2019ve got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons\u201d by Russia, reflecting the experience of chemical weapon use during the Syrian civil war.

International Women\u2019s Day events have attracted significant opposition in recent years, with organisers facing death threats and abuse.\nVenezuela has released two American citizens held on terrorism charges.

Conservative Yoon Suk-yeol battles Democratic party opponent Lee Jae-myung to succeed former human rights lawyer Moon Jae-in.\nIt\u2019s a common prejudice that art is regarded \u201cas heterosexual until proven otherwise\u201d. The exhibition, Queer: Stories from the NGV Collection, is keen to dispel this, through a sensory explosion of classical paintings, video works and objects of striking juxtaposition, Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen writes. \u201cIt\u2019s a dazzling and sometimes overwhelming kaleidoscope of the myriad ways in which sexuality and gender can be experienced and expressed.\u201d\n\u201cIf the community had not gone in there with their private boats, hundreds of people would have died.\u201d As the extensive cleanup from flooding in northern NSW begins, so too does the debate about who is best resourced to act as \u201cfirst responder\u201d in major natural disasters, Calla Wahlquist writes. And while there are \u201ccultural, practical and constitutional issues\u201d surrounding the deployment of the army in instances of flooding or fires, is the Australian defence force the answer?\n\u201cHow can I help my child worry less about all that\u2019s happening in the world?\u201d It\u2019s a common concern for many parents, amid wars, natural disasters and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

        "content": "Insipid with the new ball but at least determined thereafter, England began life on the road without Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad and on a stop-start second day of this first Test they required the generosity of their hosts for the incisions that came their way.\nWhen the latest in a succession of squally showers brought the close, West Indies were 202 for four from 66.5 overs, 109 runs behind after Jonny Bairstow\u2019s eventual 140 had helped England stick 311 on the board first up. Nkrumah Bonner, the late-blooming Jamaican No 4, was 34 not out from 103 balls, while Jason Holder responded to his elevation to No 6 with typical diligence and an unbeaten 43 from 104.\nThough Anderson and Broad operating in tandem away from home may be one veteran too many these days, England\u2019s decision to omit both from this tour has cast a long shadow over their replacements. It has also left Joe Root, a captain in desperate need of results after just one win from his last 14 matches, with no bankers.\nIt would be too soon to draw hard conclusions but against weaker opposition than the Australia side that forced this drastic change, this was a disappointing start. Chris Woakes, now the leader of the attack, found a consistent line elusive and went at four and a half runs an over for his one wicket, while Craig Overton is hardworking but not as skilful as Ollie Robinson, whose back spasms opened up the spot.\nInstead it was the Durham pairing of Mark Wood and Ben Stokes who looked likeliest, enjoying reverse and conventional swing respectively. That said, the latter\u2019s deployment for nine overs raised eyebrows after the pre-match chat that his return from a side strain would need him to be used sparingly. Root had little choice.\nBoth did manage to stem the flow. So too Jack Leach, who looks to have a first-innings plan and drift from the Caribbean breeze. In Bonner and Holder they met stiff, orthodox resistance. The latter\u2019s double century in Barbados three years ago remains burned on English retina but West Indies (in theory) have a long tail and also bat last. As such, day three will begin pregnant with possibilities.\nThe names of Anderson and Broad cannot have been far from the lips of the travelling supporters at lunch as they made their way to the various bars and jerk shacks that line the grass banks on either side of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. West Indies had won the first session, knocking over the final four English wickets for a cost of 43 runs \u2013 Bairstow was the last man out to a fine swirling catch from Holder before rightly lapping up the applause \u2013 with the openers Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell then cruising to 44 for no loss in the space of 10 overs.\nEngland had at least passed 300 for the first time in 10 innings this winter. That said, this slightly meagre milestone was achieved thanks to Holder putting down a much simpler chance off his own bowling when Bairstow had 126 after Jayden Seales had removed Woakes (28) and Overton (0) in the space of three deliveries.\nBut the response that followed was not inspiring, Root forced to use four bowlers before the interval as Woakes and Overton struggled to replicate their decorated forebears. The analysts at CricViz had this down as England\u2019s third least threatening new-ball burst in the past decade but good old eyesight was enough here.\nNeedless to say Anderson and Broad were in situ for the two ranked lower but on a couple of heartbreaking pitches at the MCG and the SCG during the 2017-18 Ashes tour; this surface, though slow, did offer a bit of nibble with the harder ball when West Indies bowled and the Dukes ball, though different to that in England, does swing.\nThis creeping dread continued into the early afternoon, Brathwaite shedding his barnacle tag with the fastest of his 33 scores above 50 in Test cricket. Last year one of the horses he owns, War Eagle, claimed victory in the 81st Barbados Derby and the West Indies captain flew out of the traps himself here, drilling seven fours and one booming straight six off Leach that shocked all who have followed his career.\nEngland had hit the session with fresh energy, at least, and though not every move from Root made sense \u2013 such as Woakes bowling from the Sir Curtly Ambrose End, when the breeze was going against his outswinger \u2013 they went on to take four precious wickets through some limp batting from their hosts. First came a gift from Campbell, the aggressive Jamaican left-hander who had the temerity to ramp Anderson three years ago. He had just pulled Overton for a thundering four to reach 35, only to then glove a slightly shorter delivery from the Somerset man down leg. Then went Brathwaite, reaching for a wide, albeit 91mph, delivery from Wood that was almost guided to Overton at gully like it was catching practice.\nStokes then teased an edge to slip off Shamarh Brooks on 18, getting away swing from the Sir Andy Roberts End and meeting a loose drive. And though Ben Foakes had put down Jermaine Blackwood off Wood on nought \u2013 a tough one-handed chance down to his left from an inside edge \u2013 Woakes soon ended a personally chastening session with an inside edge off the Jamaican that flew to gully off the thigh pad. West Indies were 127 for four at tea and still 184 runs in arrears.\nBut in between cloudbursts during the evening session, Bonner and Holder gutsed it out and the ball went soft. No chance was offered in their unbroken stand of 75 that was mindful of Leach in particular; along with an economy under two, the left-armer got the odd one to grip in a way that augurs well for England come the fourth innings.",

Reports suggest he is close to joining Barcelona but Tuchel cannot comprehend why the centre-back would depart and thinks he should blossom at the club he joined as an academy player at 16.\n\u201cThere is no need to go now because he is right at the edge to finally take the next one, two, three steps at Chelsea,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is done here.\n\u201cThat is why I strongly recommended him not to go before it is done. And it is clearly not done. He now has a situation given the formation, given the partners at his side, given his status, given his age: this is his moment. And I cannot understand if he leaves exactly at this moment.\u201d\nTuchel sounded resigned to Christensen\u2019s departure, saying the 25-year-old\u2019s future was \u201cin doubt, we hear the rumours\u201d and Chelsea are \u201cnot happy about it\u201d. He continued: \u201cFor Andreas we have unbelievably much to offer. It is the club where he came through the academy and I think he has a lot, also, to appreciate where he is right now. He profited a lot from the support, the structure. Now is the crucial moment to step up and be a huge player with this history.\u201d\nAsked whether historical giants such as Barcelona and Bayern Munich offered better prospects for footballers than Chelsea, Tuchel said: \u201cThere cannot be a big improvement in any other club in terms of organisation, the supporting level for the players, the mentality, the competition in which you play: I don\u2019t see an upgrade in any other club. Of course if you want to have the challenge of a new league and maybe also in money there are some possibilities always available if you\u2019re a top, top player. But you can fulfil any dream here: I think we should not hide from that and we should not be too humble in that.\u201d\nChelsea travel to the Premier League\u2019s bottom club, Norwich, who they beat 7-0 in October, on Thursday as they seek a fourth straight league win. Reece James is doubtful with what Tuchel described as \u201cmuscular problems\u201d and could face a spell out. \u201cWe are worried,\u201d he said. \u201cA setback for sure \u2013 I hope not a big one.\u201d",

        "content": "Australia has been through worse, Chris Kenny contends, while Andrew Bolt suggests global heating is \u2018brilliant for farmers\u2019\nFloods and their causes are complicated and there has been a clamour for answers from Australians over the role global heating could have played in the devastation left along the east coast this week.\nBut one thing several of Australia\u2019s conservative commentators are sure about is that the climate crisis had nothing to do with it.\nOn Sky News, Chris Kenny said Australia \u201calways has, and always will have\u201d floods, droughts and fires and, \u201callowing for some records\u201d, the country had been through worse cases of those extremes before.\nIn the pages of the Herald Sun last Thursday, Andrew Bolt described how a set of \u201cgreen journalists\u201d were acting like \u201cvultures\u201d for \u201cexploiting\u201d the floods.\n\u201cThis pathetic game of climate porn happens every time we get some natural disaster, wet or dry, fires or floods,\u201d Bolt thundered.\nAlmost two weeks ago, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest assessment of the impacts of climate change.\nIn interviews, IPCC authors in Australia said it was likely that rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had played a role in the extreme rainfall that led to flooding.\n\u201cBut hang on! Just a year ago this same IPCC suggested the opposite,\u201d Bolt said.\nBolt claimed that last year\u2019s IPCC report that looked at the core science of climate change had found heavy downpours tended to \u201cdecrease over the eastern and southern regions\u201d of the country.\nBut this statement was referring to observations of the past, not the likely impacts in the future.\nThe same report included a fact sheet \u2013 not mentioned by Bolt \u2013 on findings for the Australian region, which said eastern Australia should expect \u201cmore extreme rainfall events\u201d as the world warms.\nBolt wrote that climate change had been linked to drought, fires and now floods \u2013 as if climate change can\u2019t have multiple affects.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford this con any more,\u201d he said.\nProf Mark Howden, director of the Australian National University\u2019s Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, is \u200b\u200bvice-chair of the IPCC working group that wrote the latest report.\nHe told Temperature Check: \u201cThe basic relationships between air temperature and moisture holding capacity and the linkage of this to extreme storms and floods are well known and have been for centuries. The projection of increased flood risk as atmospheric and ocean temperatures rise is robust.\u201d\nHe said it would be wrong to ignore the role of climate cycles such as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o on the risk of flooding and droughts, but \u201cas is ignoring the basic physics which ties in the common factors between droughts and floods. This is climate science 101.\u201d\nBolt rarely likes people to attribute anything to climate change but seemed unusually confident about one thing in his column.\nPointing to a record winter crop this year across Australia (but not pointing to how record November rainfall had caused widespread downgrades of wheat quality in New South Wales), Bolt wrote: \u201cGlobal warming has actually been brilliant for our farmers.\u201d\nSo in the same column Bolt argues both for and against attributing changes in weather conditions to climate change. Global warming is apparently only a thing when it\u2019s doing something good.\nBut to the question of whether global warming is \u201cgood for farmers\u201d. Really?\nBack to the IPCC, which said last week it had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that hotter and drier conditions would disrupt future agricultural production.\nAnd what about flooding?\nThe NSW Farmers chief executive, Pete Arkle, told Temperature Check: \u201cWhile there may be beneficial changes to some commodities in some areas in the short term, when we look more broadly at the trends and the impact of extreme weather events it is hard to be optimistic about the impact of climate change.\n\u201cFarmers are among those most exposed to the full impact of extreme weather, be that bushfires, floods or droughts. It is critical we take steps to minimise the impact of climate on agriculture, because we will all be impacted if there is reduced food security.\u201d\nThere has been much conservative commentary in the past week over Russia\u2019s bloody invasion of Ukraine, with some weaving a narrative that Europe\u2019s pursuit of renewable energy and emissions reductions gave Putin the confidence to wage war (opportunistic, much?).\nOn Radio National\u2019s Between the Lines, Tom Switzer invited Rupert Darwall on to talk about how the war might change commitments to net zero.\nAnyone who suggested the world could do without fossil fuels was \u201cout with the fairies\u201d, said Darwall, presumably including the International Energy Agency and its detailed analysis of pathways to net zero among that throng of fantasists.\nSwitzer introduced Darwall as a researcher at the RealClearFoundation and twice mentioned he was \u201cthe author of The Age of Global Warming, a History\u201d.\nThat book was published in 2013 and, while the benign title might not give it away, the book has been celebrated by climate science denialist groups.\nOdd that Switzer didn\u2019t mention Darwall\u2019s 2017 book with a rather less benign title: Green Tyranny: Exposing the Totalitarian Roots of the Climate Industrial Complex.",

        "content": "P22, known as the Brad Pitt of his species, has been visiting residential neighborhoods and welcomed like a star\nOn Tuesday night, a quiet street in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles had a rare celebrity visitor. P22, the city\u2019s most famous mountain lion, was spotted around 7pm on Berkeley Circle, about three and a half miles south of his home in Griffith Park. The National Park Service later confirmed his presence through a radio collar.\nResidents shared photos from doorbell cameras and grainy pics from inside their homes. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s pretty awesome,\u201d one resident told the LA Times. \u201cThe whole neighborhood\u2019s excited.\u201d\nThe sighting marked a unique outing for the beloved lion, who is hardly spotted in public despite living in an urban park that\u2019s visited by millions of people, and whose enigmatic and attractive nature have earned him the nickname \u201cthe Brad Pitt of mountain lions\u201d.\nP22\u2019s presence is also a potent reminder that these large cats live cheek-and-jowl with the megacity\u2019s human inhabitants, though they generally keep to the coastal scrub brush chaparral of the mountains and rarely enter human developments.\nIt\u2019s not clear why P22 left his home range of Griffith Park, but it\u2019s also not the first time: in January he appeared on the deck of a house in Beachwood Canyon, caught on video by a camera. He also hid under a house in Los Feliz in 2015 and mauled a sleeping koala at the LA zoo the following year.\nA study published by the National Park Service in September 2021 analyzed data from 29 GPS-collared adult and subadult mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains, Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains and nearby areas. They used 128,133 locations to estimate home range size and evaluate how they used the landscape, including investigating which parts of it mountain lions prefer to spend time in.\nMost of the creatures avoided human areas, or came close only at night. There were two exceptions in the study \u2013 P41, a male cat in the Verdugo Mountains area, and P22, who possessed the smallest home range ever recorded for an adult male: just nine square miles surrounded by freeways and residential areas in and around Griffith Park.\nThese two males also ventured into residential areas far more than any other mountain lions, though the park service researchers note that even for them, 90% of their locations were in natural areas.\n\u201cInterestingly, these two males exhibited strong differences in selection relative to time-of-day that appeared to be responses to human activity,\u201d said John Benson, senior author and an assistant professor of vertebrate ecology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, in a statement.\n\u201cWhen we analyzed selection on an individual basis, we found that these two males altered their behavior towards avoidance of developed and landscaped areas during the day, but towards selection of those areas at night.\u201d\nThis February marks the 10th anniversary of P22 wandering into Griffith Park as a young lion and making it his home. He has plenty of deer to eat, no male competitors in his territory, but also no hope of finding a mate.\n\u201cA city long bashed for being a concrete jungle full of smog proves the world wrong by making a home for a mountain lion,\u201d Beth Pratt, California director for the National Wildlife Federation, recently told the Guardian, adding that she loved how the city had embraced an apex predator. \u201cThe LA area possesses a value of coexisting with wildlife that I celebrate \u2013 people share their Ring videos of P22 making an appearance in their back yard with excitement, not fear.\u201d",

        "content": "Having built a lead through their striker\u2019s brilliance, Paris Saint-Germain crumble under Real Madrid\u2019s pressure\nThere was once a dream that was Paris. It lasted for just over an hour. At which point, enter the old world \u2013 and enter Karim Benzema, who had the night of his storied footballing life in this Champions League last-16 second leg.\nUnder the lights of the Bernab\u00e9u Paris Saint-Germain produced one of the more extraordinary collapses of elite football\u2019s modern history, a collapse made all the more abject by the divine well of talent in this Paris team, the gerrymandering certainties of Messi-dom, of that divine front three, bought to secure the crown of European club football in this, our year of Qatar 2022.\nAnd football can be bought. The glorious history of Real Madrid is testament to that. And yet, somehow, also, it can\u2019t. This was, with all due apologies to the supporters of PSG, in its own twisted way an oddly life-affirming humiliation.\nFor 61 minutes Madrid had been stretched in every direction, tortured on the left flank by the brilliance of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Madrid looked tired. They looked harried and flat. Those white shirts have a vital sense of self: occasionally beaten, but never out-flashed or out-glitzed, remaining always their own cold clean crisp square of light. But this felt like something else, a shifting of the ground beneath those regal feet.\nAt which point something strange happened, one of those rare moments where time and space seem to stretch in weird directions.\nWhat does \u00a3350m of attacking talent get you? Not to mention limitless nation-state finances and the greatest club footballer of all time. Brittleness. Operatic collapse. A sense as Madrid pressed hard, of something glossy, callow and frail.\nFast forward from 61 to 78 minutes and the birds above the Bernab\u00e9u were already flying backwards through the sky, as Benzema completed a 17-minute hat-trick with the most impudent of touches.\nThe goal to make it 3-2 on aggregate came straight from kick-off with the scores only just levelled on the night. A single forward pass caused panic in that hilarious, high-kicking farce of a Parisian defence. Benzema nipped in front of his man to nudge the ball into the net with the kind of touch you might reel off in a game of lunchtime corridor football, turning away and bellowing back at the stands with something that felt as much like rage as joy or disbelief.\nThere was time for PSG to lose their cool, for some hacks and kicks and lunges. But they were done by that stage: finished, toasted, flamb\u00e9ed. And if it was unavoidably comical, there was also something grotesque in the spectacle of collapse.\nFor an hour this supernaturally talented team, gassed and juiced and pumped up beyond the limits of their domestic league, had romped around the Bernab\u00e9u like princelings.\nIt was always impossible not to see something of old and new in this match-up, of ambition versus inheritance. And it seemed with 39 minutes gone that this tie was dead, that an unanswerable force was being applied.\nSome of the Madrid fans had cheered Mbapp\u00e9 when his name was announced. Yes, we recognise you. This is us. And he was a living nightmare for Real\u2019s left side for long periods. This was pain, suffering, fear, a sense of pre-humiliation every time he went veering on to the ball. How do you mark that which cannot be marked? Mbapp\u00e9 was a ghost.\nAnd six minutes before half-time he was out there once again in his own huge lime green space, freed by a single pass from Neymar. The finish was beautiful, a feint followed by a ping hard and low into the corner. This is something to be treasured. Mbapp\u00e9 is 23 now, but also six years into his elite career. The natural speed and balance, the hard-honed super-shredded physique are at their peak. Plus every part of the craft is nailed, matured, fine-tuned, to the extent he can improvise and create, blow bubbles, a footballer reaching out into the far comers of his own supreme talent.\nIt seemed for most of this game that would be the story, a thrilling footballer taking another significant step. Except, it wasn\u2019t. Thank you, Paris. Because, frankly, this was a gift. Who saw it coming? Probably only Benzema, who just kept coming, pressing his shoulder to the wheel and producing two neat finishes to turn the game before that final moment of fantasy.\nBenzema has 30 goals in all now this season. He remains such a complete, brilliantly smart forward. But Madrid will surely sign Mbapp\u00e9 in the summer whatever happens from here. They\u2019re a billion dollars in debt. What\u2019s another 150 million? This is the brand, the future earnings, the strange white soul of this club.\nIt was too much for Paris here, who gave us first brilliance, then finally that sense of something fragile; a brittleness that was both painful, and also oddly bracing by the end.",

A week later the reference rate jumped up to 1.22 and active cases had also risen by just shy of 7,000.\nAt the same time, though, hospital and ICU admissions slightly decreased.\nNSW recorded 16,288 new infections and four deaths on Thursday. A total of 991 people were being treated in hospital, with 39 requiring intensive care.\nJust 56.3% of eligible people in the state had been administered three doses of a Covid vaccine.",

Coral cover over the reef has risen in the last 18 months after benign conditions, but the Australian Institute of Marine Science has said this recovery is dominated by fast-growing corals susceptible to bleaching.\nDr William Skirving, of Noaa\u2019s Coral Reef Watch, said the accumulation of heat stress had paused during most of February, but had now returned.\nWithout clouds and cooler weather, Skirving said there was a risk of bleaching from the Whitsundays to the northern tip of the reef by the last week of March.\nBut he said it was unclear how much the cloud cover in February had benefited the corals because the amount of sunlight, as well as the level of heat, were both important in translating the heat stress into bleaching.\nThe Morrison government requested the Unesco mission last year after it successfully lobbied against UN scientific advice that the reef should be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger.\nUnesco said the visit was confirmed by letter to the Australian government on 21 February, but there had been no official announcement of the visit.\nOne expert from Unesco and another from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) would travel to the reef.\nUnesco declined to provide any details about where the scientists would visit, as did the office of the environment minister, Sussan Ley.\nA report from the mission is expected to be completed by early May ahead of a scheduled meeting of the 21-country world heritage committee in June.\nThe Morrison government has argued the reef is being singled out, and that world heritage sites should not be placed on the in danger list because of impacts from climate change.\nThe head of oceans at WWF Australia, Richard Leck, said Unesco advisers had last year recommended the reef be listed as \u201cin danger\u201d primarily because of concerns about the impacts of global heating.\n\u201cIt is absolutely vital that if there is a bleaching event, that these experts are witness to the impacts of coral bleaching,\u201d Leck said.\n\u201cWWF fervently hopes there won\u2019t be a bleaching event, but if it does occur every effort should be made so that Unesco and IUCN are witness to that.\u201d\nHe said WWF Australia had made a formal request to the government to brief the mission while it was in the country.\n\u201cWe have also spoken directly to representatives of IUCN who are very keen to meet with non-governmental organisations, scientists and civil society,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nDr Lissa Schindler, a reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said she expected an itinerary that ensured \u201cthe visiting delegates gain a true picture of how seriously impacted our reef is by the climate crisis, water pollution and poor fishing practices, and what the solutions are.\u201d\nSchindler said there had not yet been an invitation to non-government groups to speak with the mission, \u201cso we are concerned they will not be presented with a true picture of what is happening on our reef\u201d.\nProf Terry Hughes, a leading coral reef researcher at James Cook University, said the scientists should visit coalmines and export terminals along the reef \u201cto see for themselves the scale of fossil fuel exports across the reef\u201d.\n\u201cThey should look at the causes of the decline of the reef,\u201d he said.\nThe Guardian had reported that in the latest major UN climate report, the Morrison government unsuccessfully attempted to insert a sentence saying the reef was not in crisis.\nA spokesperson for the environment minister said: \u201cThe world heritage committee will be given every opportunity to satisfy its requirements.\n\u201cThe mission is being planned in collaboration with the world heritage centre and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\u201d",

About 200,000 people want to get out of the city, but with humanitarian corridors shelled, only around 2,000 to 3,000 are able to leave a day.\nThe first image, taken by private company Maxar, shows the extensive damage done to grocery stores and a shopping mall in the city, with both buildings smouldering under the intense shelling\nAnother photo reveals the damage done to residential areas, where many residents are without power, heat, water or communications for over a week. Some of the buildings have been entirely destroyed.\nAnother image shows swathes of residential houses destroyed, with neighbouring parkland appearing to be scorched. What appears to be an apartment block on the left edge is heavily damaged.\nAnother comparative image shows the damage done to malls and shopping centres, with the roof of the central building partially collapsed and the interior exposed.\nThe worst of the shelling has been coming in the city\u2019s west, with the Red Cross describing conditions in the city as \u201capocalyptic\u201d, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.\nIn the call with journalists, Orlov called the siege \u201cpure genocide\u201d.\n\u201cThey have used aviation, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, grads and other types of weapons we don\u2019t even know about.

Now it will be felt acutely, with early calculations showing more than 2,195 houses have been rendered uninhabitable because of the floods.\nMore than 6,260 Airbnbs are operating in the area, according to the open source data tool Inside Airbnb. Of those, 4,006 (64%) had a high availability rate, meaning they were available to tourists most of the year and unlikely to be an owner-occupier renting out their home occasionally.\nIt is not clear how many of the listed properties were damaged by the floods and neither Airbnb or its competitor, Stayz, has provided those statistics.\nThe housing situation in the area is dire. The two evacuation centres are full and with nowhere else to go, houses are cramped, with up to three families living in the same property.\nThere has been pressure from local residents, advocates and some politicians for companies like Airbnb and Stayz to open their doors and offer families long term rentals. Airbnb said it was working to provide free accommodation on a temporary basis, but was yet to release the details.\n\u201cOur hearts go out to all those impacted by the floods and the local authorities working hard to keep our communities safe,\u201d a spokesperson said when approached for comment.\n\u201cWe are currently working with a partner on an initiative to offer up free, temporary housing via our Host network and hope to have more to share shortly.\n\u201cIn the meantime, Airbnb is encouraging its community to donate to the Australian Red Cross Floods Appeal.\u201d\nJenny Leong MP, the NSW Greens housing spokesperson, said the \u201coffer\u201d to help was not enough when people urgently needed places to stay.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear what is being offered free, for who, and for how long \u2013 people need certainty and security,\u2019 Leong said.\nIn November, the New South Wales government changed the short-term holiday policy and now several of LGAs in the northern rivers are subject to a restricted 180-day rental period.\nLeong said the state government needed to step in to either suspend short-term rental accommodation, unless in exceptional circumstances, or provide incentives for owners to offer long-term leases.\n\u201c[This would] ensure that people who have nowhere to live have access to every available rental property at reasonable market rates for the next 6-12 months.\u201d\nKate Stroud, a Lismore resident, said with no assistance from the government or accommodation providers they have been left to fend for themselves.\nStroud and her partner lost everything in the floods and have been staying with friends in Lismore.\n\u201cBasically everyone is staying with friends, you have multiple people, families, all staying in one house,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere was already a housing crisis here due to the increase of people coming during Covid and investors from bigger cities buying property here and converting them to Airbnb.\u201d\nThe flood water level in her house went up to her neck, and they had to be rescued by a neighbour with a jetski. They have been told it will take three months just to get the power back on, and are worried building supplies, which were already struggling with supply chain issues, will be hard to come by.\n\u201cOur friend has said we can stay, but that\u2019s not realistic if it\u2019s months and months,\u201d she said.\nThe chief executive of Northern Rivers Community Gateway, Jenni Beetson-Mortimer, said the community urgently needs temporary to long-term housing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no transitional accommodation at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s dire here for the community at the moment.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nShe called on the government to help provide emergency housing for people, so they weren\u2019t overcrowded in the homes that survived.\n\u201cWe need the government to do something in that space.\u201d\nSandra Johnston lives on the Gold Coast, but she is stepping in to help. Two days ago, she reactivated the Caravans for Flood Victims (Give, Loan or Rent) Facebook group \u2013 which she started with a friend after the bushfires. The group helps people with caravans get in contact with people who have lost their homes.\n\u201cNow they\u2019re drying out down there I thought this would be perfect,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cIf everyone who had a caravan or motorhome lent one, it would mean those people trying to clean their houses would have a shower and toilets. They\u2019re self-sufficient.\u201d\nThe group has only been up three days but she has already had interest and hopes word will spread.\n\u201cWe want a flood of caravans now,\u201d she said.",

Violation of 3 USC 17,\u201d Eastman wrote to Jacob in his 9.44pm email, referring to the statute in the US criminal code.\nBut in the second part of his email, Eastman claimed that because the statute had already been violated in small ways \u2013 delays that amounted to a few hours at best \u2013 Pence should have no problem committing \u201cone more minor violation and adjourn for 10 days\u201d.\nThat admission is significant since it demonstrates Eastman knew the scheme to delay Biden\u2019s certification was unlawful \u2013 which the select committee believes bolsters its case that he was involved in a conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct Congress.\nThe House counsel, Douglas Letter, appearing on behalf of the select committee in federal court on Tuesday, referenced the admission as he postulated that Eastman knew what he was advocating violated both the Electoral Count Act statute and the constitution.\nLetter also said of Eastman\u2019s request of Pence: \u201cIt was so minor it could have changed the entire course of our democracy. It could have meant the popularly elected president could have been thwarted from taking office. That was what Dr Eastman was urging.\u201d\nBut if Eastman knew the scheme violated the law, it raises the additional possibility that Giuliani also knew it was unlawful when he called the Republican senator Tommy Tuberville and asked him to object to Biden\u2019s wins, after the Capitol attack had taken place.\nIn a voicemail recorded at about 7pm that evening, and published by the Dispatch, Giuliani implored Tuberville to object to 10 states Biden won once Congress reconvened at 8pm, a process that would have concluded 15 hours later and dragged the joint session into the next day.\n  \u201cThe only strategy we can follow is to object to numerous states and raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrow \u2013 ideally until the end of tomorrow,\u201d Giuliani said.\nThe admission from Eastman came as part of a thread of emails with Jacob in filings submitted by the select committee seeking to challenge Eastman\u2019s claim that more than a hundred emails demanded by the panel are protected by attorney-client privilege and should remain secret.\nBut the select committee said in the filings that it should be allowed to conduct an in camera review of the records to determine whether the crime-fraud exception applied, arguing in part they appeared to show Eastman was engaged in criminal conspiracy and common law fraud.\nThe judge in the case ruled in the panel\u2019s favor after the hearing on Tuesday, allowing a review of around a hundred emails to determine whether the records were subject to privilege, though he did not comment on whether Eastman might have engaged in criminal activity.",

Can you send me a recipe of molotov cocktail?\u2019\u201d\nThe Australian government has ratcheted up sanctions against Russian political, military and business figures over the invasion of Ukraine, but has stopped short of expelling Russian diplomats at this stage saying it wants to keep open lines of communication.\nShalkivskyi told the National Press Club in Canberra countries including Australia needed to \u201cuse all means that we have in our disposal in order to fight back\u201d.\nHe said while in his line of work he usually stuck with \u201cdiplomatic narratives\u201d, children had died in shelling.\n\u201cI am not in the position to be diplomatically polite. Having my parents in bomb shelters, it makes you kind of more decisive,\u201d Shalkivskyi said.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019d like Russian ambassador to be expelled. I\u2019d like to have a boycott of all Russian supply routes and services in Australia. I\u2019d like to stop any shipping companies to enter territorial waters. I\u2019d like Australia to join the fight in countering Russian propaganda.\u201d\nThe comments came after Ukrainian authorities said Russian bombs had \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d a hospital in Mariupol. Local authorities said at least 17 people had been wounded in the shelling of the complex, which has children\u2019s and maternity wards.\nIn January, the Russian ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, gave a lengthy press conference in Canberra in which he denied the buildup of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine was a sign of aggression.\nSince then, the Russian embassy in Canberra has repeated the line that Russia is engaged in a military operation to \u201cdemilitarise\u201d Ukraine.\nShalkivskyi said Putin had made a number of miscalculations, including whether the west was divided and how quickly Russian forces could capture Kyiv.\nHe said Ukraine was engaging in dialogue with Russia, but would not surrender its freedom. \u201cWe belong to the European family and there is no way we will give up,\u201d he said.\nShalkivskyi said he had received calls from Australians seeking to join Ukraine\u2019s foreign legion of volunteers to fight against Russian forces, but he did not know how many had actually travelled to the country.\nThe Australian government has cautioned citizens against travelling to Ukraine to fight on either side, saying it would be dangerous and legally ambiguous.\nUnder the Criminal Code, it is an offence for an Australian to enter a foreign country to engage in hostile activity, unless it is done as part of \u201cthe person\u2019s service in any capacity in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign country\u201d.\nThat means whether such travel is legal hinges on whether international volunteers will actually be considered full members of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\nPressed on that point, Shalkivskyi said he did not have \u201ca lot of information because it\u2019s just started\u201d but believed the foreign legion was \u201cpart of our defence force\u201d.\nWhile he confirmed the embassy would \u201cfacilitate\u201d people who wanted to travel to join the legion, such as by supplying contact details, Shalkivskyi also urged them to check Australia\u2019s laws and make their own \u201cadult choice\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cI always stress that we do not want you guys to get in trouble on your way back home, so please check the legislation,\u201d he said.\nShalkivskyi said he understood that the first shipment of supplies that left Australia bound for Ukraine last week was \u201cnon-lethal equipment\u201d.\nDefence said on Thursday a second RAAF C-17A Globemaster flight had now delivered \u201cdefensive military assistance\u201d to the Ukrainian government.\nThe Australian government has pledged $70m in lethal military aid and Shalkivskyi said he understood that aspect would largely be coordinated by Nato.\nThe opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Russia had \u201ctrampled fundamental principles\u201d and \u201cinflicted terrible injury and death on civilians\u201d.\nAddressing the Lowy Institute on Thursday, Albanese said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had \u201cshown incredible courage and leadership in extraordinarily difficult circumstances\u201d.\nBut Albanese said there were \u201cmany reasons to be concerned\u201d about the \u201cno limits\u201d partnership that Russia and China formalised just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, in light of Beijing\u2019s \u201cgrowing assertiveness in our region\u201d.\nThe defence minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday it would be wrong to assume Putin\u2019s \u201conly ambition\u201d was to take Ukraine, or that Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitions were \u201crestricted just to Taiwan\u201d.\nDutton said Australia must therefore \u201cprovide a deterrence effect\u201d and work closely with its allies.

        "content": "A jury has retired to consider its verdict in the case of the Northern Territory constable charged with the murder of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi Walker\nThe judge presiding over the murder trial of Northern Territory constable Zachary Rolfe has urged the jury to ignore emotion or sympathy that may have arisen during confronting evidence in the case when they consider their verdict.\nJudge John Burns gave the jury his directions in the supreme court on Thursday. The jurors have now retired to consider their verdict after an almost five-week trial.\nRolfe, 30, has been charged with murder and alternative charges of manslaughter or engaging in a violent act causing death. The alternative charges are only considered by the jury in the event that Rolfe is found not guilty of the more serious charges.\nThe court has heard Rolfe shot Kumanjayi Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019.\nWalker stabbed Rolfe with scissors prior to the first shot being fired. This shot was not subject to any charges.\nBut the court heard that 2.6 seconds after the first shot, Rolfe fired again, and then 0.5 seconds later he fired a third time. These final two shots were fired from close range at a time when Rolfe\u2019s partner, then constable Adam Eberl, was attempting to restrain Walker on a mattress. The prosecution alleges Walker no longer posed a threat to Rolfe or Eberl at that stage. The defence says Rolfe acted reasonably to protect against the threat to himself and Eberl, who Rolfe says he believed Walker was attempting to stab.\nBurns told the jury that although the confronting nature of the evidence in the case could arouse strong emotions, they should \u201cguard against\u201d that.\n\u201cYou must not let emotion or sympathy affect your verdicts,\u201d he said.\nBurns told the jury that the prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Rolfe did not hold an honest belief that it was necessary for him to fire the second and third shots in order to protect Eberl, and that firing the shots was not a reasonable response in the circumstances, as Rolfe perceived them.\nBurns said the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that firing the shots was unreasonable, in the circumstances as Rolfe perceived them to be, for Rolfe to perform his duty as a police officer.\nThe crown must also prove that Rolfe did not honestly believe, when he fired the second and third shots, that this was reasonably necessary to perform his duty or function as a police officer.\nBurns said that if the jurors were not convinced about the prosecution\u2019s case in relation to any of these defences, they must find Rolfe not guilty of all charges.\nTo reiterate this, he drew the jury\u2019s attention to comments made by prosecutor Philip Strickland SC on Wednesday that if they believed Rolfe\u2019s evidence that he had perceived Walker to be stabbing Eberl at the time of the shooting, they must find him not guilty.\nBurns said it was important for them to understand the distinction between perception of events and reality in hindsight.\nTo demonstrate this, Burns provided an example of a police officer who shot a bank robber after seeing them threatening a teller with a gun, only to discover after the shooting that the robber was armed with a replica firearm. As the police officer perceived the gun to be real when he shot the bank robber, he would be protected from criminal prosecution, Burns said.\n\u201cThe important question may well turn out to be what was the perception, rather than the reality,\u201d he said.\nBurns also reiterated that despite the extensive evidence about Rolfe\u2019s training and the events leading up to the shooting, he was charged with criminal offences, not a police regulatory offence about failing to follow orders or not acting in accordance with his training.\nHe also said that despite the jury having seen extensive footage of the shooting they should \u201cguard against\u201d considering it as an event broken down into tenths or one-hundredths of a second, rather than as a \u201csingle extremely brief and violent incident\u201d.\nThe jury foreperson informed the court late on Thursday that they had yet to reach a verdict and would end deliberations until Friday morning. The foreperson also requested that a transcript of Burns\u2019 directions be provided to jury members.\nThe foreperson said earlier on Thursday that if they had not reached a verdict by Friday they did not intend to deliberate over the weekend but would resume on Monday.",

Oil and gas companies have argued that money for a windfall tax would have to come from their budget earmarked for long-term investments. But when they are paying out such huge sums to wealthy investors and top earning staff that argument looks laughably weak.\n\u201cBusinesses that truly want to serve society should be happy to contribute a slightly higher rate of tax at a time when they are having a bonanza year, through pure good luck rather than their own hard work or innovation, while society as a whole is struggling with rising costs, stagnating wages and further economic turmoil.\u201d\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has caused energy prices to rise further since the start of the year, suggesting that even higher bills may be likely for households and businesses.\nVan Beurden was forced to withdraw Shell from its joint ventures with Kremlin-controlled oil firm Gazprom worth a total of $3bn, including drilling projects at the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, projects in Salym and Gydan, both in western Siberia, and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has been cancelled since the invasion.\nShell announced this week it would stop buying Russian oil or gas, and would close its 500 petrol stations in the country. The petrol stations closures have prompted a $400m writedown on assets.\nVan Beurden said last week: \u201cOur decision to exit is one we take with conviction.\u201d However, in his foreword to the annual report he described the exit as \u201cin line with government guidance\u201d, referring to the heavy pressure thought to be exerted by the UK government as it sought to isolate Russia\u2019s economy.\nThe company awarded Van Beurden \u20ac5.4m in bonuses and long-term incentive payments, on top of his \u20ac2m fixed pay. He also received a \u201cmotoring allowance\u201d of \u20ac14,400 and money to pay for transport between his home and the office of \u20ac2,494.\nHe will also be paid moving costs and a housing allowance for two years after relocating from the Netherlands to London at the company\u2019s request.\nShell paused Van Beurden\u2019s annual bonus during the first year of the pandemic. Before that he received \u20ac10m in 2019 and \u20ac20m in 2018, a record if excluding 2014 when pension calculations inflated his reported salary.",

Often considered the European Hawaii, with a strong volcanic presence, from black sand to geysers, the Azores are also known for their incredible hydrangeas, which frame houses and line roads and pathways all over the islands, and start flowering in spring. One of the central, smaller islands, Faial, boasts the largest collection of hydrangeas in varying shades of blue, so much so that it has the nickname Blue Island.Nadia, Aberdeen\nNorwich is a hidden gem in itself, but if you do venture east be sure to visit Eaton Park, covering 80 acres and designed by Captain Sandys-Winsch. Opened in May 1928 by the Prince of Wales, it is a perfectly wonderful place to enjoy the beauty of nature, especially in spring under a canopy of pink and white confetti from the most beautiful cherry trees in our county. There is so much else on offer too \u2013 domed bandstand, boating lake, lily pond, pitch and putt, miniature railway and formal gardens.Suze, Norwich\nThe garden of Villa Bardini, in Florence, is not on most tourists\u2019 must-see lists; and yet the blooming of its wisteria signals the beginning of spring for most Florentines. The long pergola on which the flowers rest leans into one of the most beautiful views of the city, framing it with Florence\u2019s own colour, purple. I always find the scene to perfectly encapsulate the gracious beauty of the city, whose very name means \u201cblooming\u201d. You could write an entire history of the city through its flowers and gardens: the wisteria in Villa Bardini; the roses in the nearby Giardino delle Rose; and the wild, purple fleur-de-lys springing from the sides of the cobbled streets.Bianca Belli, London\nAt whatever time of year you visit Bodnant Garden in north Wales\u2019s Conwy Valley, there\u2019s something colourful to see. But my favourites are flowering now: the large magnolia trees are truly magnificent, as are the hellebores.

Graham Dean, Heysham, Lancs\nFootsteps tread the winding path, adorned either side by an abundance of wildflowers. A wind whips through the alpine meadows, but the warmth holds in the Valencian hills. Rabaniza blanca (wall rocket) spreads like wildfire, under the blossoms of the late almond tree. A faint nutty aroma infiltrates the air, masking eager senses from a sombre seed. Two eagles circle above, glimmers of gold tainting their feathered coats in an aerial rendition through the southern skies. The bountiful Relleu valley thrives in this temperate climate, bearing hope and beauty with spring awakening \u2013 I say \u201cmuchas gracias for this rare fiesta\u201d.Jenna Rainey, Bath\nTake a trip to Thriplow (silent \u201ch\u201d), eight miles south of Cambridge, and you will be greeted by hundreds of daffodils at every turn, arrays of yellow to brighten even the greyest spring day. Following a successful fundraiser for church roof repairs in 1969, the village holds an annual Daffodil Weekend, incorporating a country fair and raising money for local charities. This year it takes place on 19-20 March (\u00a310 adult, \u00a35 child, online tickets only). There is even a variety of daffodil named after the village \u2013 the Thriplow Gold. Sharon Pinner, Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire\nA strolling local, seeing me admiring the flowers in the Jardin des Tuileries last spring, advised me to take a short day trip to Giverny \u2013 the home and gardens of Claude Monet, which inspired his impressionist paintings. The scene was like Monet\u2019s own canvas \u2013 climbing rose bushes, pink cherry trees, weeping willows and flowerbeds of dahlias, irises and wisteria. I almost expected to see elegant ladies promenading along with delicate parasols, although the floral display was a sensual feast in itself. The best view is from the Japanese bridge.

There are clumps of blue and white bluebells, cowslips, primroses, cow parsley, wild garlic and many more species. Towards the end of our visit, we came across a path lined with bright red tulips, which stood out among the blue and yellow shades. Entry is free and there\u2019s also an audio trail introducing you to the plants and their connection to people.Helen Jackson, London\nI would head to Rose Valley, near Kazanlak in Bulgaria. This valley is known for its rose-growing industry and production of liquid gold, ie rose oil. Roses begin blooming in mid-May and continue until mid-June. They hold a month-long rose festival in June, annually, where you can participate in rose-picking, a festive parade and other cultural activities. All the outside events apart from rose picking are free to enter, too! It\u2019s just the perfect getaway for flower lovers.Humaira, Leicester\nThe wild daffodils of Dymock and Kempley in Gloucestershire are a heartwarming sight. There are lots of options for walks \u2013 you can drive or cycle, as it covers quite a large area. My favourite is Saint Mary\u2019s Church, Kempley, which has beautiful medieval decorations as well as a churchyard full of wild daffodils.Andrew Tector",

Out of it has come a cycle of nine community pieces that will sing the song of local key workers in trios over three nights, with the whole lot repeated on Saturday.\nDay one gave us the teacher, the funeral director and the social care worker. A real-life teacher and school students bulk out the cast for the deftly choreographed opener, written by Sonali Bhattacharyya. It bounces between class and staffroom to show the impossible strain on schools, struggling to keep their students\u2019 futures on track. \u201cI\u2019d have to tidy my room,\u201d protests one boy, as Miss tries to persuade him to switch his camera on for a virtual lesson. A familiar story is freshly shocking when seen as a single piece of exuberant choric witness, with staff and kids singing for the same side.\nWe\u2019re slid into an altogether chillier ambience by a little gem of a black comedy written by Josh Elliott. A yuppie chats away in a barber\u2019s chair while the jovial barber instructs his gangly assistant on how to administer a perfect shave. Except this is not a barber\u2019s but a funeral parlour that is sprucing a young Covid victim up for a \u201cmeeting\u201d with his grief-stricken father. Cleverly and tenderly it shows us the sort of care we will all one day need, even if we\u2019d prefer not to think about it.\nAs the corpse is wheeled offstage he is passed by a parade of elders in their glad rags who present the care workers\u2019 case, written by Francesca Beard. Fragments of song and shards of anecdotes are tossed between 16 players, the oldest 96 years old, before they settle to a cautionary tale about who in our cut-throat society would be invited aboard Noah\u2019s ark. The lucky few realise too late that the virus has set sail with them and there is nobody aboard who cares. This is thoughtfully enabled campfire theatre, a precious, collaborative improvisation to keep the darkness at bay and remind us who we are. Tears, I shed a few.\nThe Key Workers Cycle is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 12 March.",

        "content": "Plan to study civil engineering and architecture was ditched when Blades called and defender is now part of push to reach top flight\nIt is almost 18 months since Rhys Norrington-Davies\u2019s name was up in lights in the headmaster\u2019s weekly newsletter at Royal Russell school in Croydon, celebrating his first call-up to the Wales senior squad. It was there that he achieved A-levels in maths, physics and geology, and was accepted into Southampton University to study civil engineering and architecture, at a time when being part of a Premier League promotion push felt rather unlikely.\n\u201cEducation was my main focus and the thought of getting back into football was a bonus,\u201d he says. \u201cI was preparing to go to uni. Growing up I used to like structures, building sandcastles on the beaches, so I always had an interest for it.\u201d\nBut then Sheffield United came calling with a professional contract and the defender, released by Swansea at 16, returned to the game, via the Kinetic Academy programme, from which Joe Aribo, Josh Maja and Kwadwo Baah also progressed.\nNorrington-Davies made his United debut in August after productive loans in the Championship with Luton and then Stoke last season. They followed spells with Rochdale and Barrow, the latter in non-league.\n\u201cI needed to go out and get regular first-team football. The loans were ideal because I was new to the game, raw and they enabled me to develop my game. At the rate Sheffield United have progressed in recent years, finding themselves in the Premier League, I had to raise my standards. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve improved massively over the last two or three years but there is still room for progression.\u201d\nNorrington-Davies spent the majority of his childhood in Aberystwyth, west Wales, attending a Welsh primary school, but was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He spent two and a half years in Nairobi because his father, Patrick, who grew up in the village of Dol-y-bont, was based in Kenya with the British army. His mother, Lowri, hails from Tre\u2019r-ddol, another nearby village. The family returned home when Norrington-Davies was seven but he has fond memories of his time in Africa.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your typical upbringing. I\u2019ve got some friends who have since moved back to the UK, who I still keep in touch with to this day. It was a great experience \u2013 it is very different to the UK, that\u2019s for sure. I saw everything, from the coast, Mombasa, to the Masai Mara. I did all the safari tours but more wild camping. It was a fantastic childhood.\u201d\nAfter joining Luton in September 2020, he targeted a senior Wales call-up by the end of the season but, a month later, he made his debut against Bulgaria. Norrington-Davies has six caps and is set to be part of the squad to face Austria in a World Cup semi-final play-off this month. He played with Daniel James and Joe Rodon, among others, at under-21 level and Tyler Roberts, who will miss the game after hamstring surgery, and Rabbi Matondo, at under-15s. These days the Wales manager, Robert Page, is on his doorstep in Sheffield. \u201cHe played for Sheffield United so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s down at the games. It is down to myself to keep playing well and to do my thing on the pitch to keep myself in the setup. It will be a great camp to be a part of. It is a massive game.\u201d\nThe immediate focus is on Sheffield United\u2019s trip to Coventry, another team chasing a play-off spot, on Saturday after Tuesday\u2019s impressive 4-1 win over Chris Wilder\u2019s Middlesbrough, managed by his former boss Chris Wilder, on Tuesday. The Blades have soared to fifth after one defeat in 12 matches. Since the former under-23s coach Paul Heckingbottom took charge in November, Norrington-Davies has flourished at wing-back in a 3-5-2 familiar to supporters at Bramall Lane from Wilder\u2019s extraordinary reign en route to the Premier League.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got us working hard again,\u201d the 22-year-old says of Heckingbottom, who replaced Slavisa Jokanovic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an honest group of players here with good quality as well. Every manager has a different philosophy and this is something the current manager is massive on.\u201d\nNorrington-Davies, who turns 23 next month, is surrounded by several players who have been here before, including the defender John Egan, the midfielder Oliver Norwood, who is targeting a fourth promotion from this division, building on previous successes with Brighton, Fulham and Sheffield United, and the evergreen 36-year-old captain, Billy Sharp, the Championship\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer. But the 22-year-old Wolves loanee Morgan Gibbs-White scored the pick of the goals in midweek, nonchalantly flicking home Ben Osborn\u2019s cross. Heckingbottom has lost only two league games to help the Blades to within five points of second-placed Bournemouth, who have two games in hand.\nIt is five years since Norrington-Davies captained Royal Russell, where he boarded, to the ISFA (Independent Schools Football Association) Cup at Stadium MK, beating Millfield in a game officiated by the Premier League referee Martin Atkinson. Now the top flight is in sight. \u201cIf you had asked me five years ago: \u2018Do you think you would be where you are today?\u2019 I would probably say \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 but things change quickly in football and I\u2019m glad of it.\u201d",

        "content": "Weather conditions disrupted the para Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics on Thursday as warm temperatures meant that, even with an earlier-than-planned start time, the artificial snow at the Yanqing National alpine Skiing Centre was melting as athletes attempted the technically difficult giant slalom course. Temperatures had been forecast to rise to as high as 23C (73F).\nAustria\u2019s 16-year-old Johannes Aigner secured his second gold and fourth medal overall of these Games in the men\u2019s visually impaired class, finishing 1.68sec ahead of the defending champion, Giacomo Bertagnolli of Italy. The final two runs of Aigner and Bertagnolli pushed Britain\u2019s Neil Simpson into fifth, meaning he could not add to the two medals he has won in Beijing.\nThere was heartbreak for the Slovak Marek Kubacka, who finished fourth. Kubacka lost his sight aged nine and was the only completely blind athlete in the men\u2019s para alpine visually impaired field. In order for him to compete, his guide, Maria Zatovicova, carries a loudspeaker with her that emits a constant sound and her instructions so that he can judge how to follow the course. As a B1 classified athlete, to compensate for the slower speed at which he skis, his clock runs at 60.53% of real time. His margin on missing out on the podium was 1.55sec.\nIn the men\u2019s standing giant slalom, Santeri Kiiveri of Finland won gold by 0.04sec from Thomas Walsh of the US, who crossed the line appearing to believe that he had done enough to secure the victory. Britain\u2019s James Whitley finished sixth, moving up from 12th at the halfway stage after a sensational second run to lead the event for a time. Only the bronze medallist, Arthur Bauchet of France, went faster than Whitley\u2019s second run time of 57.3sec.\nThe final event of the para alpine skiing on Thursday was the men\u2019s sitting giant slalom, with athletes having to cope with a course that was rutted and cut-up from the earlier runs. That led to a series of crashes, including for Jeroen Kampschreur of the Netherlands on the penultimate run, who looked all set for a medal until losing control. Norway\u2019s Jesper Pedersen made it look easy in the end, with a victory by more than three seconds. Rene de Silvestro of Italy took silver and Liang Zilu won bronze for the hosts. But it was agony for Argentina\u2019s Enrique Plantey, as Pedersen\u2019s finish pushed him off the podium, and he ended up fourth, missing out on his nation\u2019s first Winter Paralympics medal.\nChina have consolidated their lead in the medal table, with 31 medals overall, including 10 golds. Canada remain second with seven golds, and Ukraine are third with six.\nThe warm temperatures have caused organisers to reschedule some events on the final three days of the Paralympics. The snowboard banked slalom finals have been moved from Saturday to Friday, and all remaining Alpine skiing events are set to start 90 minutes earlier than previously scheduled. Nevertheless the Games\u2019 vice-president, Yang Shu\u2019an, said: \u201cI can tell you that the snow sports competition in the Winter Paralympics has been very smooth. Athletes, delegations and technical officials are very satisfied. We need to find the window, the best time for our competition schedules. If we encounter the impact of extreme weather, we will immediately start relevant plans.\u201d\nConditions can be more controlled in the indoor venues and at Beijing\u2019s Ice Cube, with no chance of qualifying for the semi-finals, the British curling team were playing for pride on Thursday. Gary Smith was deputising for the injured David Melrose, but could not help the team avoid a 6-3 defeat to the defending champions, China, in their morning match. That ensured the hosts will qualify for the next stage and results elsewhere mean Sweden and Canada join them in Friday\u2019s semi-finals.\nThe British rallied to win their final match 8-4 against Latvia, a result that confirmed Slovakia as the last semi-finalists.\nIt was a rest day for the para ice hockey squads on Thursday, with the cancellation of the seventh/eighth place play-off match, as the expulsion of the Russian squad left seven teams in the tournament. On Friday, the Czech Republic and Italy will play off for fifth place, sandwiched between the two semi-finals: Canada v South Korea and China v the USA.",

        "content": "Negotiators aim to agree on legal framework for protecting international waters that are key to \u2018life as we know it\u2019\nThe world has a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d chance to protect the high seas from exploitation, warned scientists and environmentalists, as negotiators meet at the UN headquarters in New York this week to hammer out a new treaty on the oceans.\nOne scientist described the treaty, which will set out a legal framework to protect biodiversity and govern the high seas, as the most significant ocean protection agreement for four decades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important it happens now,\u201d said Prof Alex Rogers, science director of Rev Ocean, an ocean research NGO. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to see industrialisation of areas beyond national boundaries, including distant-water fishing and potentially deep-sea mining.\u201d\nA vast portion of the ocean, 64% by surface area, lies outwith the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) that cover approximately 200 nautical miles from the shorelines of individual states. Referred to as the high seas, they host a wide array of ecosystems and species, many insufficiently studied and recorded. The increasing reach of shipping vessels, seabed mining and new activities such as \u201cbioprospecting\u201d of marine species have put the high seas and its biodiversity at increasing risk of exploitation.\nA group of 50 countries has signed up to the 30x30 coalition, which launched in January 2021 and aims to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030. But without an agreement, these much-heralded pledges will have no legal basis in the high seas.\nCurrently, all countries have the right to navigate, fish and carry out scientific research on the high seas with few restrictions. Only 1.2% of this marine area is protected.\nJean-Baptiste Jouffray, a researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University who has quantified the rise in human pressures on the marine environment, describes a \u201cblue acceleration\u201d, or dash for resources, over the past two or three decades. \u201cYou have a race for the ocean in all these different sectors, but there is no overview.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the fallacies about the high seas is that you have this great big empty space. The other is that it is a quiet space. Both of those are untrue,\u201d said Doug McCauley, associate professor of ocean science at the Benioff Ocean Initiative at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\u201cBy all indicators it is busier that it has ever been. Shipping has increased by 1,600% since 1982, when Unclos [the UN law of the sea] was signed. Industrial fishing takes place farther and farther from shore and more than 55% of the ocean is fished. There is new interest in offshore oil and gas. And there is the threat of mining in the deep sea.\u201d\nMcCauley contributed to a paper for the Pew Charitable Trusts highlighting 10 biodiversity hotspots in the high seas that would benefit from protection. They include the Costa Rica Dome \u2013 nutrient-rich waters that attract yellowfin tuna, migratory dolphins, endangered blue whales and leatherback sea turtles \u2013 and the Emperor Seamount chain, which arches north-west of the Hawaiian islands towards Russia, a highly biodiverse series of seamounts.\nThe paper concludes that, while a patchwork of international bodies and treaties manage resources and human activity in areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2013 including fishing, whaling, shipping and seabed mining \u2013 they vary greatly in their mandates, and their jurisdictions often overlap. This piecemeal approach \u201cleads to a degradation of the environment and its resources\u201d, said the paper. It also makes setting up marine protected areas legally challenging.\n\u201cThe treaty won\u2019t create protections for hotspots but will hopefully create a structure so that we can create international parks for the first time,\u201d said McCauley. \u201cIt\u2019s a starting place and a really important starting place.\u201d\nPeggy Kalas, of the High Seas Alliance, said: \u201cAfter decades of negotiations and planning, the world has a once-in-a-generation chance to build meaningful protections for an environment that supports life as we know it.\n\u201cIt is hard to exaggerate how crucial these talks are for the multitrillion-dollar global ocean economy, a vital food source for billions of people and perhaps the best protection the planet has from climate change.\u201d\nHowever, NGOs expressed concern over being excluded from this week\u2019s negotiations, after the UN restricted entry to delegates and intergovernmental organisations due to Covid.\nWill McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace, which has long campaigned for a network of ocean sanctuaries, said it set a worrying precedent. \u201cThese negotiations are simply too important to avoid proper scrutiny; the UN should review its decision and allow civil society to participate in a safe and meaningful way.\u201d\nThe UN general assembly voted on 24 December 2017 to convene a multi-year process to develop a treaty on \u201cthe conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction\u201d.\nThree of the scheduled negotiations have taken place. The fourth and final set, previously scheduled for March 2020 but postponed due to Covid, is now running from 7 to 18 March at the UN headquarters in New York.\nThe draft treaty addresses four key areas: marine genetic resources; area-based management tools, including marine protected areas; environmental impact assessments and capacity building; and the transfer of marine technology.\nLast month, at the One Ocean summit in Brest, France, more than 100 countries, including the UK and 27 members of the EU, agreed to achieve a strong and robust UN high seas treaty, giving the talks a powerful political boost.",

If they just say \u2018well, he\u2019s going to be a good cop, we\u2019ll knock off the rough edges\u2019, you\u2019re storing up a problem that could last for 30 years.\u201d\nJohnson pledged in 2019 to recruit an extra 20,000 police officers. Police numbers had dropped by more than 20,000 since 2010.\nAsked about the scale of problems with culture and behaviour in policing, Winsor told reporters at a briefing on Thursday: \u201cI don\u2019t think that what we saw in Charing Cross police station is limited to London. But we don\u2019t have evidence yet of just how widespread that is.\n\u201cI think these matters are taken very seriously \u2026 by all police forces. And while what has happened recently is London-centric, it is not London-limited in all probability.\u201d\nRevealing how a regional chief constable had told him within the last fortnight \u201cwe have this problem too\u201d, without disclosing their identity, he added: \u201cI expect that there are pockets of those things in other parts of the country.\n\u201cHow much and how bad it is, we don\u2019t know at the moment.\u201d\nHis comments follow the release of a wide-ranging report that also says:\nFraud has \u201cexploded\u201d and continues to be wrongly treated as a low priority by many forces.\nThe model of local accountability, involving police and crime commissioners, has fractured some relationships between police and politicians, and left some chief constables lacking in confidence in their operational independence.\nThe \u201cfragile architecture\u201d of having 43 police forces, devised in 1962 and implemented in 1974, is \u201cvery far from fit for purpose\u201d in the 2020s.\nOnline crime is now by far the most prevalent type of crime. \u201cIt used to be that our children were unsafe if they were out on the streets. They\u2019re now more unsafe in their own bedrooms,\u201d he said.\nPublic expectations to fight crime cannot be met without sufficient funding and \u201cthe public through their politicians must decide how much threat, harm and risk they are prepared to tolerate\u201d.\nWinsor said: \u201cMajor shortcomings in policing persist, and these need to be addressed. Criminality is often now complex and far more sophisticated, and investigations can take far longer. If the police continue to use 20th-century methods to try to cope with 21st-century technology, they will continue to fall further and further behind,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking to the BBC last month, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, claimed the prime minister was correct to leave out fraud when quoting statistics stating crime had decreased, because fraud is not a \u201ccrime that people experience in their day-to-day lives\u201d.\nWinsor said it was \u201cwrong\u201d for politicians to leave fraud out of crime statistics. \u201cFraud needs to be taken far more seriously.\n\u201cIt is indefensibly a low priority for the police. It is a tsunami of offending which can, and does, lead to catastrophic human suffering and some people destroy themselves when they\u2019ve lost everything they\u2019ve ever worked for,\u201d he said.\nThe report comes at the end of Winsor\u2019s 10-year stint in the job, which ends in this month.\nHe said: \u201cAs I reflect on the past decade in policing, I commend the courage and commitment of police officers and staff across the country.\n\u201cThe severity of the problems that our police service now faces should not be underestimated, but the public should be reassured by the strong, pragmatic and professional approach of police officers and staff.\u201d",

        "content": "Brighton DomeAfter the serious shows that made her name, the comedian is in playful mood here, recounting her courtship with and marriage to her producer\nBody of Work is \u201ca feelgood show\u201d, Hannah Gadsby tells us. Its predecessors, the smash hits Nanette and Douglas, shot the Tasmanian to stardom \u2013 but weren\u2019t all smiles. Her latest, recounting romance and recent marriage to her producer Jenney Shamash, arrives with a lighter, looser vibe. Even looser than intended, perhaps. Gadsby enters in a wheelchair, having broken her leg on a trip to Iceland. That poleaxed her European tour, and restricted recent gigs to venues with adequate disability access. So \u201cI haven\u2019t done this very much\u201d, she tells us: the show might be a little rough and unready.\nBy the end, as Body of Work ambled towards the two-hour mark, I could see Gadsby\u2019s point. In a show that makes much of the distinction between storytelling and merely listing things that happened (Gadsby\u2019s dad is apparently a poor raconteur), I missed the structural rigour of her earlier offerings. And yet, this is still a delightful set, the more so for finding the 44-year-old in such happy, playful form. Gadsby hates romcoms, she tells us \u2013 but delivers one here, after a fashion, covering her courtship with \u201cJenno\u201d, flashing back to her relationship history (drolly characterised less as \u201cbaggage\u201d, more as a tangle of tote bags), then depicting the pair\u2019s life as a couple, with Jenno smoothing the autistic, perimenopausal, post-famous Gadsby\u2019s path into domesticated middle age.\nPost-famous? One section reflects on how poorly prepared Gadsby was when celebrity came calling, and how she \u201cfucked it up\u201d via socially maladroit encounters with Jodie Foster and Richard Curtis. After criticising him for broadcasting Dave Chappelle\u2019s transphobic special, there\u2019s a tirade too against Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos, which she suspects might burn any remaining bridges to global stardom.\nAs that routine suggests, Gadsby\u2019s spikiness hasn\u2019t deserted her. But Body of Work foregrounds her homely side, as she tells her tale of new love (with droll reference to the bizarre romantic standards of heterosexuals) and conjures her parents to vividly eccentric life. If momentum dwindles towards the end, this remains a winning return for Gadsby, to whose heavy-hitting accomplishments can now be added a flair for comedy with a light heart.\nHannah Gadsby: Body of Work on tour in the UK until 19 March, then on world tour.",

How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?\u201d said Zelenskiy on Telegram.\n\u201cHospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children\u2019s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.\u201d\nThe White House condemned the attack as \u201cbarbaric\u201d while US House lawmakers voted to rush through a $13.6bn aid package that would increase military and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its European allies. The aid includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. Senate approval is expected within days. The House also passed a bill banning Russia oil imports.\nUS House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 45 minutes on Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and \u201cthe crimes against humanity that [Vladimir] Putin is committing\u201d, including the maternity hospital air strike. \u201cThis is the beast that Putin is,\u201d Pelosi said.\nPelosi indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort. \u201cAll of us will have to do more\u201d to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long term to help it rebuild, Pelosi said, referring to the US and Nato allies.\nThe US meanwhile warned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in the war. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making \u201cfalse claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine\u201d, and added that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing.\n\u201cNow that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,\u201d she tweeted.\nThe concerns came as UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made \u201clittle progress in over a week\u201d and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD said there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, likely due to the \u201cunexpected effectiveness\u201d of the Ukraine forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so.\nAs the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as \u201ccolossal\u201d and said women in labour were among the wounded.\nA local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the \u201cdirect strike by Russian troops\u201d had left children under the wreckage.\nThe deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s medieval,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure genocide. The attack isn\u2019t simply treacherous. It\u2019s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.\u201d\nThe Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials\u2019 accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack.\nThe Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as \u201capocalyptic\u201d, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis.\nJournalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food, and melting snow for water while thousands sheltered in basements.\nThe Russian army had also \u201cshot and bombed\u201d a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to.\nOn Wednesday, Zelenskiy said at least 35,000 civilians were able to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the south-east and Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\nZelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was \u201cat the maximum\u201d and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d if it did not.\nSpeaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia.\nThe conflict has also raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with major nuclear plants and the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The UN\u2019s atomic watchdog said Wednesday it saw \u201cno critical impact on safety\u201d at Chernobyl, location of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, despite a loss of power there.\nBut it warned it was not receiving updates from either Chernobyl or Zaporizhzhia, Europe\u2019s largest nuclear plant, which is also now under Russian control.\nThe UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion.\nThree rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must \u201cdemilitarise\u201d and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at ensuring Russia\u2019s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation.\nIn other developments:\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were \u201climited\u201d. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials.\nLeaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday. A draft declaration prepared for the summit said: \u201cRussia\u2019s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.\u201d The leaders are expected to discuss reducing the bloc\u2019s energy dependency on Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s request to join the EU\nThe US is weighing sanctions on nuclear power supplier Rosatom, a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday.\nNestle, cigarette maker Philip Morris and Sony on Wednesday joined the list of multinationals stepping back from the country.\nAgencies contributed to this report",

        "content": "Democrats won two major victories, but a dissenting opinion from three of the supreme court\u2019s justices set off alarms bells\nHello, and Happy Thursday,\nIt\u2019s no secret that the US supreme court has been hostile to voting rights recently. But two recent decisions, I think, highlight why what the court is doing is both alarming and inconsistent.\nOn Monday evening, the court gave Democrats two major victories, blocking Republican attempts to impose unfair congressional maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In both states the respective state supreme courts had redrawn them to be fairer \u2013 decisions which the US supreme court upheld. Yet even though legal experts expected this outcome, a dissenting opinion from three of the court\u2019s conservative justices set off loud alarm bells for me.\nThe dissent was authored by Justice Samuel Alito (and joined by Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch in the North Carolina case). The three justices wrote that they would have blocked the state supreme court maps from going into effect. They pointed to a provision in the US constitution, the elections clause, that explicitly gives state legislatures the authority to set the \u201ctime, manner, and place\u201d of federal elections. That provision, they said, likely means that state supreme courts can\u2019t impose a new map, even if the one the legislature adopts violates a state\u2019s constitution.\n\u201cIf the language of the Elections Clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections,\u201d Alito wrote.\nAlito\u2019s dissent embraces an idea called the \u201cindependent state legislature doctrine\u201d. Increasingly popular among conservative litigants, it argues that state courts cannot second-guess election rules \u2013 whether it be a gerrymandered map or a new voter ID law \u2013 passed by a legislature. It would give state legislatures enormous power over elections.\nThe theory largely fell into disuse in the early 20th century, according to a paper by Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University. The supreme court has also repeatedly rejected the idea over the last century. But in a handful of cases during the 2020 election, Alito, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Thomas all expressed interest in the idea.\nThe focus on this idea is also notable because it is directly at odds with what Alito and other conservative justices have said recently.\nReading Alito\u2019s dissent, I couldn\u2019t help but think of a majority opinion that he, Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh signed onto in 2019. In that case, called Rucho v Common Cause, they were part of a majority that said federal courts could not do anything to stop partisan gerrymandering. But, Roberts wrote, state laws and state courts could continue to police it. It was a clear instruction to litigants that they should take their cases about partisan gerrymandering to state courts, which is exactly what they did in North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\nNow, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch \u2013 and maybe Kavanaugh \u2013 seem to be backing away from that position.\nIt\u2019s not the only area of voting rights law where the supreme court has pulled a kind of bait-and-switch recently. In 2013, when a majority of the court, including Roberts, Alito and Thomas, gutted the the heart of the Voting Rights Act, designed to prevent voting discrimination, it pointed to another provision of the law, section 2, as a tool litigants could continue to use. But recently, the court has been slowly chipping away at section 2, too, making it harder to challenge laws under it and stepping in to overrule lower courts that have relied on it to block discriminatory maps. Taken together, the cases show how the supreme court is slowly attacking laws that are supposed to protect Americans against voting discrimination.\nOne other piece of Alito\u2019s dissent deserves attention because it is, I would argue, hypocritical. In two short paragraphs, Alito explained why he didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal for a court to step in and order North Carolina to adopt new congressional districts after candidates had begun filing for office ahead of the state\u2019s 17 May primary. The public interest favored such a reset, he said, to ensure that districts were constitutional. All candidates would have to do, he said, was file a new form indicating they were running in the districts the legislature, not the state supreme court, had adopted. \u201cThat would not have been greatly disruptive,\u201d he wrote.\nBut last month, Alito took the opposite approach when he agreed with an opinion by Kavanaugh saying it would be too disruptive to impose new, non-discriminatory maps for Alabama\u2019s 24 May primary \u2013 a week later than the one in North Carolina. Kavanaugh wrote: \u201cRunning elections statewide is extraordinarily complicated and difficult. Those elections require enormous advance preparations by state and local officials, and pose significant logistical challenges.\u201d\nThat argument prompted a furious response from Justice Elena Kagan, who said discrimination in Alabama should not get a free pass merely because elections were on the horizon. \u201cAlabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians\u2019 voting rights just because the court\u2019s order came down in the first month of an election year,\u201d she said.\nThe opposing conclusions Alito reached in both cases underscores the immense discretion he is wielding on the bench to evaluate these claims. In North Carolina, when the legislature\u2019s constitutional rights were at issue, it warranted the supreme court\u2019s intervention. In Alabama, when Black Americans\u2019 voting rights were at issue, he believed the court\u2019s intervention was not needed.\nAlso worth watching\u2026\nA Colorado election clerk was indicted on charges she helped allow unaurthorized access to voting equipment.\nFlorida Republicans are on the verge of creating a new office to investigate election crimes.\nThe top election official in Texas\u2019s largest county announced she would resign after the county experienced significant voting problems in the state\u2019s primary.\nNewly released records in Wisconsin provide insight into a widely criticized review of the 2020 election.",

Almost 24,000 have been waiting for more than two years.\nFor example, while 93% of people who GPs suspect may have cancer should be seen by a specialist within two weeks of their urgent referral, in January just 75% were \u2013 the lowest proportion ever. While 152,093 of the 202,816 people GPs referred to hospital were seen within two weeks, another 50,723 \u2013 one in four \u2013 were not.\nSimilarly, although 96% of people with confirmed cancer should start treatment within 31 days of doctors deciding to treat them, just 89.6% did so. That means that 2,644 of the 25,524 patients had to wait longer than a month to start receiving chemotherapy, have radiotherapy or undergo surgery.\nAnd an even smaller proportion of people with cancer who should start treatment within 62 days of being referred by a GP did so in January. While the target is 85%, hospitals only managed to treat 61.8% of them in that time, which meant that 5,161 people had their care delayed.\n\u201cIt is deeply troubling to see these figures now at yet another worst-ever record, as we know that any delay to diagnosis and treatment causes huge amounts of anxiety and distress for people living with cancer\u201d, said Eve Byrne, the director of advocacy at Macmillan Cancer Support.\nWhile the figures cover a period in which the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was putting hospitals under pressure, performance across the nine different waiting times was worse than a year earlier when they were grappling with the Alpha variant, which left more people seriously ill than Omicron.\nBoth Macmillan and Cancer Research UK pinpointed longstanding shortages of staff in the NHS cancer workforce as a key reason for the sharp decline in performance.\n\u201cMore people than ever before are facing unacceptably long waits for vital cancer tests and treatment,\u201d said Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK.\n\u201cWinter pressures and Omicron combined have only added weight to a historically overburdened NHS, but staff shortages were holding down efforts to improve cancer survival well before this.\u201d\nWes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, who was treated last year for kidney cancer, said: \u201cI know from experience the importance of an early cancer diagnosis and quick treatment. Too many cancer patients are left waiting for unacceptable lengths of time, with the insecurity of not knowing.\n\u201cThe Conservatives use the pandemic as an excuse, but that doesn\u2019t explain why cancer patients have been waiting longer every year since 2010.\u201d\nOver the last 12 months a total of 424,382 people with suspected cancer have not seen a specialist within two weeks, 19,861 of those diagnosed with the disease did not start treatment within 31 days and 50,049 had to wait longer than the supposed maximum 62 days.\nThe performance data also showed that:\nJust 73.3% of people who attended A&E in January were treated within four hours \u2013 the joint lowest ever figure \u2013 even though the target is 95%.\nAmbulances are taking longer to respond to 999 calls, both for emergency and also urgent calls.\nMore than a third of young people needing treatment for potentially life-threatening eating disorders are waiting more than 12 weeks.\nProf Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, stressed that \u201cdespite ongoing pressures our hardworking NHS staff delivered 280,000 more tests and checks for patients in January compared to the same time last year, and almost 1.24 million started consultant-led treatment, as more people continue to come forward for care who may have been reluctant to seek help during the pandemic.\u201d\n This article was amended on 21 March 2022. A mention of waiting times \u201ca year earlier\u201d should have gone on to refer to the Alpha variant, not the Delta variant as an earlier version said.",

You shouldn\u2019t go to Ukraine, and I\u2019m afraid people going from our armed services, as the chief of the defence staff made clear the other day, will face court martial.\u201d\nHis comments are in notable contrast to those by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who said at the end of last month that she would back Britons going to Ukraine to take part in the fight against the Russians.\nTruss faced criticism for her comments, which ran counter to advice on her department\u2019s own website. This says that those who travel \u201cto fight, or to assist others engaged in the conflict\u201d could be prosecuted on their return to the UK.\nA small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the resistance, while veterans and Britons without combat experience have also travelled to Ukraine. Ministry of Defence officials have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, and warned they will face prosecution if they do.\nSpeaking earlier on Thursday, the armed forces minister, James Heappey, said: \u201cIt is illegal for British service personnel to, first of all, go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this.\u201d\nAt the weekend the UK\u2019s chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said people should not \u201crush to \u2026 the sound of gunfire\u201d, and ought to offer support in other ways.",

You cannot reconcile that fundamental right to a healthy environment with these absolutely horrific environmental conditions.\u201d\nIn a report due to be presented to the UN human rights council on Thursday, Boyd says pollution contributed to twice as many premature deaths as Covid-19 in the first 18 months of the coronavirus pandemic.\nGiving the death toll from pollution in that period is a staggering 9 million, the report adds: \u201cOne in six deaths in the world involves diseases caused by pollution, three times more than deaths from Aids, malaria and tuberculosis combined and 15 times more than from all wars, murders and other forms of violence.\n\u201cThe toxification of planet Earth is intensifying,\u201d Boyd\u2019s report warns, pointing out that even as some harmful chemicals are banned or abandoned, overall production of chemicals doubled between 2000 and 2017, and will double again by 2030.\nAnd while everyone was affected to some degree, some communities were being hit far more than others. \u201cIf you look at these places that I\u2019ve highlighted in the report, pollution on our planet today is pervasive, it\u2019s affecting everyone but it\u2019s affecting some people in a really grossly unfair and disproportionate way,\u201d Boyd told the Guardian.\n\u201cThe United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one of the wealthiest countries in all of human history, is home to one of the worst sacrifice zones on the planet. This place, it\u2019s called \u2018cancer alley\u2019, in Louisiana, where there are more than a hundred oil refineries, petrochemical plants, etc,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd guess where they\u2019re located? In poor, predominantly black communities. It\u2019s just, as I said, it\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d\nOther sacrifice zones included:\n Kabwe, Zambia, where 95% of children had elevated levels of lead in their blood, putting them at risk of lifelong intellectual impairment,\n The Pata R\u00e2t landfill in Romania, where thousands of Roma people live and are exposed to arsenic, lead, mercury and other pollutants.\n The French overseas territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique, in the Caribbean, where 90% of people were found to have the carcinogenic pesticide chlordecone in their blood.\nBusinesses were the main culprit, with most happy to overlook social and environmental costs in favour of their bottom line, Boyd said, adding that money was \u201cthe main barrier to addressing the climate crisis, to addressing biodiversity loss and to addressing pervasive pollution\u201d. He called on governments to impose strong regulation on corporations causing pollution \u2013 and to stop spending an estimated $1.8tn a year on subsidies for environmentally damaging industries.\n\u201c[Oil and gas companies are] not going to voluntarily stop producing oil and gas; big coal companies are not going to voluntarily shift from being big coal companies to being big solar and wind companies: governments have to do that, that\u2019s their job, it\u2019s governments that have the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil our human rights,\u201d Boyd said.\nBut there was cause for optimism, he said. Boyd\u2019s report comes six months after the human rights council recognised for the first time that everyone had a human right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.\n\u201cAnd this is really a key point,\u201d he said. Previous agreements on biodiversity, climate change and pollution were formerly unenforceable. \u201cBut guess what: when you weld the international environmental agreements together with human rights law, human rights law brings into the equation institutions, processes, accountability.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting about this UN recognition of a right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment \u2013 it signals this union of human rights law and environmental law which can be an extremely powerful catalyst of the kinds of transformative changes that we so desperately need.\u201d",

These cover the public health response, including how decisions were made, and a wide range of other issues from shielding to lockdowns, the procurement of personal protective equipment to the closure of schools.\nHallett will also examine the economic response, including the furlough scheme, and how the NHS and wider health and social care system responded.\nAnnouncing the draft terms of reference, Johnson said: \u201cThe importance of the inquiry working to understand the experiences of those most affected by the pandemic \u2013 including bereaved families \u2013 as well as looking at any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic and our response.\u201d\nHallett will hold a four-week consultation on the draft terms of reference. They include the necessity to produce a \u201ctimely\u201d report, although the very broad remit suggests merely taking evidence may be a very lengthy process.\nThe inquiry is asked to produce a \u201cfactual narrative account\u201d of the response to the pandemic \u2013 and then to identify any lessons to be learned, \u201cthereby to inform the UK\u2019s preparations for future pandemics\u201d.\nIn doing so, the inquiry will \u201clisten to the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic\u201d. It will not \u201cinvestigate individual cases of harm or death in detail\u201d, and Hallett will not be asked to apportion blame for any failures she identifies.\nThe families of people who have died from Covid-19 have long campaigned for a full public inquiry. Johnson initially rejected those calls, before announcing one in May 2021. But he stipulated the inquiry would not begin its work until this year, when the government hoped the worst of the pandemic would be over.\nAt the time, Johnson said it would take a \u201cfrank and candid\u201d look at how the pandemic was managed.\nAn investigation by the health and science select committees has already pointed to a number of failures in the government\u2019s response, including the pace at which Covid testing was ramped up, and the decision to discharge patients from hospitals into care homes without testing.\nThe committees took dramatic testimony from Johnson\u2019s former chief aide Dominic Cummings, who claimed the prime minister consistently failed to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic in its early stages.\nBecky Kummer, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: \u201cThe inquiry is a one-off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, [and] to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future. The government finally publishing the draft terms of reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them.\n \u201cSadly, today\u2019s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the government had a rapid review phase in summer 2020, as we called for at the time.\u201d",

        "content": "Charities prefer donations of cash as it can be accessed in minutes. Here experts give their tips on how to give\nThe war in Ukraine has prompted a massive outpouring of support around the world. Some people are offering up their homes to host refugees. Others are organising collections of goods to send to people in Ukraine or neighbouring countries.\nBut charities say donating cash to them is the best way to help those caught up in the crisis. Dan Walden, Unicef\u2019s senior emergencies specialist, says that sending money, not goods, is the most efficient and effective way to distribute emergency aid.\n\u201cWe understand that it\u2019s tempting for people to want to make donations that seem more personal to them: raiding their cupboards for items they can imagine being helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut time is of the essence in Ukraine and we can get money transferred from our bank to a local bank in Ukraine within moments.\u201d\nGiving cash transfers to trusted charities, whether international ones or those operating on the ground in Ukraine, is not wasteful, he says, does not create dependency and is empowering and effective. \u201cIt would take months to get goods transferred between countries and the logistics would be very complicated, time-consuming and expensive: usually more than the goods are worth.\u201d\nJudith Escribano, the director of communications at Action Against Hunger, a member charity of the Disasters Emergency Committee coalition which has raised \u00a3150mfor its Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, agrees. \u201cWe understand why people like to donate goods in an emergency but we can\u2019t send food, clothes, blankets or medical equipment from the UK, even if they\u2019re in perfect condition.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity to sort the goods here or to distribute them once there. It\u2019s usually much easier to buy items in the countries where they are needed. It\u2019s also usually cheaper and helps local markets and economies, helping countries to get back on their feet.\u201d\nEscribano points to the carbon footprint of driving goods 1,500 miles when they could be bought in a shop in Poland, Moldova or Romania. But almost more importantly, she says, it is a question of dignity. \u201cIt\u2019s a dignified way of giving people support. It lets people know we trust them. It gives people freedom and power when they have none.\u201d\nNot only is this a fast-moving situation, but experts say the implications are likely to be long-lasting and charities will need continued support. Humanitarian aid charities are practised in delivering funds over the long term, they say, so monetary donations might contribute towards the relief effort and help to resettle families further down the line.\nBut Mark Greer, the managing director of philanthropy services at the Charities Aid Foundation, said they recognise it might not be feasible for some people to give financially at the moment. \u201cIf people want to donate goods and supplies, it\u2019s worth speaking to international aid charities \u2013 like the Red Cross or Save the Children \u2013 first to see what\u2019s most needed and how they can help.\u201d\nSupport local charities\nThere are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground.\u00a0Sunflower of Peace\u00a0is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks.\nUnited Help Ukraine\u00a0focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict.\nVoices of Children\u00a0aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods.\nThe\u00a0British Red Cross\u00a0has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people.\nSupport local journalism\nEnglish-language news outlets based in the country, such as\u00a0Kyiv Independent\u00a0and the\u00a0New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This\u00a0site on Twitter\u00a0covers many local journalists in Ukraine.\nWrite to your local MP\nThis can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on\u00a0parliament.uk.\nBut, he says, if donors give food or medical supplies in the UK, in addition to having to pay shipping costs to neighbouring countries, there are extra benefits charities lose out on. \u201cUK charities can claim gift aid on monetary donations which means that they effectively receive an extra 25% in extra funding. For example, a \u00a350 charitable donation by a UK taxpayer is worth \u00a362.50 to a charity because they can claim back tax,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEmployees can also use \u2018give as you earn\u2019, also known as payroll giving, to set up tax-effective charitable donations directly from your wages which works in a similar way to a salary sacrifice arrangement,\u201d he added. \u201cEmployees can choose which charity to support and we have seen many using give as you earn to support the Ukraine refugee crisis in this way.\u201d",

        "content": "Is it better to donate to established charities such as the Red Cross or to crowdfunding campaigns? And should you give money, or goods?\nMore than $13m has been donated to support those affected by the devastating floods in Queensland and New South Wales, and most of the money has been directed towards peer-to-peer fundraising efforts such as GoFundMe.\nMany of those crowdfunding campaigns have been set up by people living in the flooded regions to cover urgent costs and fund relief and rescue efforts, including more than $20,000 raised to run a rescue helicopter.\nSince 24 February, more than $9.6m has been donated across 1,700 fundraisers on the peer to peer platform GoFundMe. About 22% of all donations has been directed towards fundraisers based in the NSW northern rivers region. In Mullumbimby alone, 50 different campaigns have raised a total of $400,000.\nOne fundraiser, which aimed to deliver food to those affected by the floods across the region, raised $173,834 before turning off donations \u2013 far outstripping its fundraising goal of $5,000.\nBut as the waters begin to subside and formal relief agencies move in to begin the long process of helping communities recover, those community-run efforts are being replaced by formal charities.\nAs of 9 March, the Red Cross Queensland and NSW flood appeal has raised $3.86m, and St Vincent de Paul has raised $162,000. The Salvation Army, which is aiming to raise $10m for flood relief, has repurposed $1m of funds from its Red Shield Appeal to begin initial recovery efforts.\nSo what should you do if you want to help?\nFlood-affected communities have been overwhelmed with donations of goods, clothes and non-perishable foods. These items are vital in the first few days following a disaster but they are also bulky and difficult to store and distribute, and it is a lot of work for volunteers to check every item to make sure it is in good condition.\nIn almost every case, money is a more useful donation than goods. If you do have particular goods to donate, it\u2019s good practice to call ahead and check that the community or charity is happy to receive them.\nCrowdfunding is a great way to ensure funds are directed to a specific person, purpose or community, provided the campaign has been verified.\nGoFundMe says it verifies fundraising campaigns published on its site and will not release funds raised on behalf of another person until the intended recipient has signed on as a party to the campaign and their identity has been verified.\nBut crowdfunded campaigns are not subject to the same levels of compliance checks and reporting requirements as formal charities.\n\u201cCharities are heavily regulated and we have to adhere to a whole lot of different regulations and compliance requirements, which is part of being a charity,\u201d Red Cross\u2019s head of fundraising, Vanessa Byrne, said. \u201cAnd for us when we launch an appeal our focus is always to ensure \u2026 we allocate the money where it is needed the most.\u201d\nAfter the 2019-2020 bushfires, the Fundraising Institute of Australia issued a new practice note to set out the minimum standards for charities that are fundraising in times of disaster. It sets out regular, transparent reporting of the funds raised and dispersed.\nRegistered charities are audited and required to produce regular reports on how funding from particular appeals has been used.\n\u201cTransparency is so very important to us,\u201d said Major Bruce Harmer, from the Salvation Army. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the Australian public have confidence in the Salvation Army, not just in doing the work, but in reporting back and saying this is what we did on your behalf and thank you, so much, on behalf of the people we\u2019ve been able to support with the funds that you\u2019ve donated.\u201d\nByrne encourages people who are thinking of donating to research the organisation or fundraiser first.\n\u201cPeople should make sure they have a look at what the organisation is saying the intention of their appeal is, and if somebody is still not sure about the information they have read, then call the charity and ask for more information,\u201d she said.\nThe Salvation Army has been running evacuation centres in Lismore, helmed by the heads of the Salvation Army northern rivers branch, Philip and Donna Sutcliffe.\nAs of 10 March, they have provided 40,000 meals and issued 1,109 recovery grants \u2013 quick payments of $160 per adult and $60 per child issued on a debit card. Applications for both the recovery payments and for larger grants can be made at local recovery hubs.\nThose cash grants will be supported by wraparound services, which are ongoing.\n\u201cWhat organisations like the Salvation Army are looking for is the opportunity not just to do a transaction and give people some money and say \u2018we hope you\u2019re OK\u2019, we certainly do do that, but we also do wraparound services that stay with those people for years to come,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cWe still have out in the field people working with those affected by the bushfires in 2019-20. They have now been repurposed for flood support \u2026 but they will be going back to those communities.\u201d\nThe Red Cross has 550 staff and volunteers across Queensland and northern NSW working on the flood response, and is running 24 evacuation centres which have housed more than 11,000 people. Thirteen of those centres are in the northern rivers. It is also running the register find unite service, which enables people missing in the floods to register themselves as safe.\n\u201cOur focus is always on making sure that as needs arise during and after a disaster that we\u2019re allocating the money where it\u2019s needed the most. \u201c",

The higher the expected increase, the more important it is for consumers to act fast and purchase tickets for travel.\nOver the last few days, Kumar has observed increases of up to $100 on ticket prices.\n\u201cGenerally we recommend consumers buy tickets early when there is an expected increase in prices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it will be a minor increase, or grow to a major increase, but we can expect some jump.\u201d\nTom Manwaring, chair of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, said ticket prices were \u201ccoming off a very low base\u201d.\n\u201cAir fares were already very, very cheap. So now they\u2019ll just be very cheap.\u201d\nHe suggested growing confidence in the market among consumers was the main driver of prices at the moment.\nManwaring said Australians planning a trip towards the end of 2022, or early 2023, did not have to hurry to get tickets now. Coming out of Covid, he said most airlines were still operating at severely reduced capacity.\n\u201cMost airlines are currently operating at 10% to 25% of their capacity.\u201d\nOver the next six to nine months, he expects international carriers will build up capacity, meaning more seats would become available.\n\u201cCompetition between airlines as that happens will help level prices back out.\u201d\nMerkert said the oil price surge was an \u201cunfortunately timed spanner in the works\u201d for the airline industry as it recovers from Covid border closures.\nThe March 2022 ACCC report found consumers\u2019 intention to travel domestically over summer had dropped \u201cby 10 percentage points\u201d compared to December 2021.\nThe report attributed a key driver of the decline to consumer concern about contracting Covid \u2013 a \u201cdifferent challenge\u201d to the prolonged movement restrictions that characterised the pandemic earlier.\nIt also noted that volatility in jet fuel prices \u201cwill add further pressure to airlines\u2019 costs amid the pandemic\u201d.\nAn ACCC spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cair fares often reflect consumers\u2019 willingness to pay, or the level of airline competition, more than the underlying costs of providing the service.\n\u201cHowever, air fares may increase to some degree should high jet fuel prices remain,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis may further hinder the industry\u2019s recovery.\u201d\nAirlines often enter hedging contracts based on expected future prices to protect from short-term fluctuations in jet fuel prices.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThe ACCC report, however, noted that the pandemic \u201chas made this strategy somewhat ineffective\u201d.\n\u201cThe uncertainty around flying activity has reduced the ability of airlines to accurately forecast fuel consumption volumes,\u201d the report reads.\nJoyce said Qantas had hedged 90% of its fuel needs until the end of June, which will \u201cgive us time to react to that higher fuel price\u201d.\nMerkert said smaller carriers or new airlines such as Bonza Airline that compete on cost were less likely to secure a hedging contract.\n\u201cSo when fuel goes up by 30% to 40%, costs compromised by fuel price becomes a big issue for them.\u201d",

        "content": "\u2018It would have been so sad to watch one of them mourn the other,\u2019 say daughters of Victorian couple\nFrom the moment they met to their final days in hospital together, Jeanette and Michael Ryan\u2019s relationship was a love story. For six decades they were dedicated to each other, and both tested positive to Covid-19 on New Year\u2019s Eve.\nThey were admitted to hospital in the regional Victorian city of Shepparton 10 days later. Michael was 84 when he died on 15 January. His wife followed him exactly a week later, aged 82.\nTheir four children, Olivia, Joanne, Mike and Damien, say their deaths were \u201csad, but not tragic\u201d because they can\u2019t imagine how either of them would have endured life without the other.\nMike says his mother, a practising nurse before she retired, used to rise at 5.30am for a 7am start. \u201cDad used to get up with her, make her breakfast, and go out every morning and get in the old Galaxy,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt was always hard to start when it was cold, so he would turn on the heating and warm it up so she wouldn\u2019t be getting into a freezing car. He\u2019d do that every morning.\u201d\nThe family don\u2019t know where the couple acquired the virus \u2013 they became ill sometime in the busy holiday period when Covid cases spiked across much of the country. They\u2019re just glad they managed to spend one last Christmas together.\nJeanette Davis was born in 1939 in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. A passionate musician, she won a scholarship to attend the Conservatory of Music, but money was tight so she entered the workforce as a nurse instead.\nIn 1961, Jeanette met her future husband working in the ICU department at St Vincent\u2019s hospital. Michael was being treated for a broken nose after an ice skating fall.\nHe wrote later, in a poem he titled Jeanette:\nShe walked into my life one day In nineteen sixty one. I, the patient in the bed, She the ray of sun.\nThe uniform was crisp and trim, The nurse\u2019s cap so neat, She moved with grace and confidence On those tiny little feet.\nMy heart was lost I must admit. It was true love at first sight. I hadn\u2019t thought it possible That this feeling could be right.\nWhen she came towards me I knew she was the one. The first words that she said to me were \u201cYour gown\u2019s on back to front.\u201d\nMichael was smitten but Jeanette needed a little more convincing. Their daughter Joanne says in the early days, her dad would finish work on his family\u2019s farm in little town of Dookie at 6pm and drive two and a half hours down to Melbourne to pick Jeanette up from her shift the same evening.\nTwo years later, they were married and moved to Dookie in 1964, where they would live out the rest of their lives together. Michael\u2019s family had farmed in the sweltering Goulburn Valley town since the 1850s.\nDookie is now home to a small community of creatives, welders and horticulturalists, but, in Michael\u2019s day, life consisted of working on the farm and in his family\u2019s equipment business.\nWhen Jeanette arrived, she progressed up the ranks in nursing, while Michael ran the farm by day and the Hy-Tone cleaning company at night. Times were tough \u2013 the couple endured drought, financial hardship and declining sheep and wheat prices.\nBut Michael was ahead of his time as a farmer. He was the first in the region to work at night, putting lights on his tractors and harvesters. In the late 70s he turned to soil conservation and was a pioneer in salinity control. He was also deeply creative.\nHis daughter Olivia says they called him the \u201cplowing poet\u201d, as he\u2019d often recite and write poems while driving his tractor \u2013 or, as he called it, \u201cspinning ever decreasing circles in the paddock\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019d get an inspiration while he was going around the paddock and just stop the tractor and write stuff down,\u201d Joanne says.\n\u201cHe said anyone watching him would\u2019ve thought he was insane. People didn\u2019t realise how clever he was \u2013 he was essentially self-taught in most things. He taught himself to play piano, he heard an opera piece over the radio one night and fell in love with opera, he subscribed to Time magazine and would read it from cover to cover.\u201d\nHis son Mike says his dad was the kind of father who would find time to clean and polish his children\u2019s black leather school shoes despite working night and day.\nHe has vivid memories of his dad spreading newspaper on the floor of the laundry, where he would kneel and scrub the shoes before lining them up in the hallway to be donned in the morning.\n\u201cMy entire life \u2026 I was always aware, even when I was a child, no one else\u2019s father was like him in his dedication to us, and his sacrifice of almost everything else that he would do in his life to look after us,\u201d Mike says.\n\u201cI always thought if I did end up being 50% the man he was, then I would have done more than I ever thought I could.\u201d\nJeanette was just as devoted a mother and nurse.\n\u201cShe compared her success to a duck, swimming in the water \u2013 on the surface, it\u2019s all calm and collected and beneath you\u2019re pedalling like crazy,\u201d Mike says.\n\u201cHer attitude to life was to never give up, and try as hard as you can.\u201d\nShopping with Jeanette, her children say, was impossible because she couldn\u2019t go into town without running into someone she knew, who would profusely thank her for the care she gave them or their family.\n\u201cMum was fierce and scary,\u201d Joanne says. \u201cBut she was also kind and totally fair. With mum in your corner, you knew that you could not lose, she just would not allow that to happen.\n\u201c[My parents] had unwavering faith in our abilities. Whenever we told them of our children\u2019s achievements their standard answer was, \u2018I knew they would,\u2019 or, \u2018Of course they did.\u2019\u201d\nJeanette\u2019s nursing career, which spanned 57 years, eventually led to managerial roles at Goulburn Valley Health and regional Victorian aged care facilities.\nShe may not have retired, aged 72, if she hadn\u2019t been diagnosed with bowel cancer \u2013 which she went on to recover from. She\u2019d probably be on the frontline of Covid, too, if not for her age and failing health.\n\u201c[When Covid hit], she rattled off a whole list of things they had to do \u2013 set up people in isolation, put them in full PPE, she knew exactly how to do it,\u201d Joanne says.\nTheir children pushed the couple to protect themselves from the virus before the vaccine arrived, and only go into town for essential shopping.\n\u201cThey they begrudgingly listened to what we said and they agreed with it,\u201d Joanne says.\n\u201cBut they knew that time was marching on for them. So they waited like we\u2019d ask them to be vaccinated. They waited until they\u2019d had the booster. And then their feelings were \u2026 \u2018We need to see our family. We are getting older and we are getting frailer. And we can\u2019t wait any longer.\u2019\u201d\nMike says Jeanette was adamant the family Christmas went ahead this year, \u201cto the point where she was ringing me every day checking to see if we were coming for two weeks beforehand\u201d.\nIn the end, about a third of the family came down with the virus. In a seemingly arbitrary roll of the dice, Jeanette and Michael were among them.\nJeanette lost her life just four days before she was named the City of Greater Shepparton Senior Citizen of the Year.\nJoanne accepted the award on behalf of her mother in front of a large crowd, with many of the Ryan family present. There were mixed emotions that day \u2013 grief and heartbreak, tangled up with pride.\nBut despite the family\u2019s loss, Joanne says what happened to her parents was the \u201ckindest thing\u201d if they were going to die of the virus.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted either of them to be as heartbroken [as] we are that they\u2019re gone, and to have to cope without that person who\u2019s been there for the past 60 years,\u201d she says.\n\u201cPeople think losing both is harder than losing one, but I don\u2019t think it has been. It would have been so sad to watch one of them mourn the other.\u201d\nJoanne would have loved her parents to \u201cgo on for ever and ever\u201d, as would all of the family. They were the type of people \u201cyou just wanted to go and chat to \u2013 tell them what things you\u2019re up to and what the kids were up to\u201d.\n\u201cBut none of us wanted them to suffer,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThey kept telling us at the end, how proud they were of all of us, how happy they were with what they\u2019d achieved in their lives.\n\u201cThey really wanted us to know that there were no regrets \u2013 that they couldn\u2019t have wanted for any more than what they had achieved.\u201d",

Lastra also laid the blame at the door of Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the PP president of Galicia, who is set to take over from Casado.\n\u201cThe far right is back in government 40 years on, thanks to Feij\u00f3o,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cToday is a bad day for Castilla y Le\u00f3n and for Spanish democracy.\u201d\nHer comments came hours after Feij\u00f3o said that Spain needed \u201ca new politics that listens and offers moderation and calm\u201d.\nVox \u2013 which has called for a \u201creconquest\u201d of Spain, the building of an \u201cunbreachable wall\u201d around the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and the repealing of laws on gender-based violence \u2013 regularly rails against what it sees as the hegemony of political correctness.\nVox has managed to become the third largest party in Spain\u2019s national parliament by exploiting culture wars, discontent with the country\u2019s two main political parties and the fallout from the 2017 Catalan independence crisis.\nPolls suggest it is now nipping at the heels of the PP, which, under Casado, has had a contradictory relationship with its far-right rival. In October 2020 \u2013 less than two years before his party agreed the Castilla y Le\u00f3n coalition \u2013 Casado rounded on Vox, accusing it of practising a politics based on \u201cfear, anger, resentment and revenge\u201d.",

        "content": "Mercedes have firmly rejected suggestions their new car for the Formula One season features any illegal components. Responding to reported comments from Red Bull, the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said their innovative sidepod design unveiled in Bahrain was within the new regulations.\nWhen Lewis Hamilton took to the track for the final test this week, his Mercedes was radically different from the one at the first test in Barcelona. They have used the side impact structures as fins and mirror mounts and in so doing have dramatically decreased the size of their sidepods. The intent is to improve airflow and increase downforce. The design has the potential to give Mercedes a major pace advantage going into the new season, which begins in Bahrain on 20 March.\nOn Thursday morning, Germany\u2019s Auto Motor und Sport reported that Red Bull\u2019s team principal, Christian Horner, had already called the car\u2019s legality into question. \u201cFrom our point of view, Mercedes went a step too far,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t correspond to the spirit of the regulations. For us, these wings are illegal.\u201d\nIn a surprising twist Red Bull quickly and strenuously denied Horner had made any comments about the Mercedes. Nonetheless, Wolff responded by noting that although they were the only team to have adopted such a radical approach, their car had been designed in full consultation with F1\u2019s governing body, the FIA, which had confirmed it was within the regulations during development.\n\u201cWhen you go down a specific development direction, the FIA scrutinises it and you make them a part of the process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were keen in not running alone, but being in touch with the FIA, that is why I think it will be OK. It is clear that when you come with an innovation it creates the kind of debate that we are having here. That was expected.\u201d\nGiven there are new rules of governance this year, it is possible the design could become outlawed should enough teams believe it confers an unfair advantage.\nF1\u2019s director of motorsport, Ross Brawn, was at the helm of the new regulations, the biggest shake-up the sport has experienced since the 1980s, aimed at improving the chances of overtaking. Brawn said the Mercedes approach, which he described as \u201cextreme\u201d, had not been expected and noted that even if the car is within the regulations such innovations could now be banned mid-season should eight of the 10 teams (known as a \u201csupermajority\u201d) agree.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Mercedes concept we didn\u2019t anticipate, it\u2019s a very extreme interpretation of the regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom our perspective, it\u2019s largely about does it affect the objective of the regulations? From the teams\u2019 perspective, they want to be sure that no one\u2019s taken an interpretation that they don\u2019t feel is correct. So I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of debate in the next few days.\u201d\nThe other teams will have the opportunity to protest against the design before next week\u2019s race but it remains to be seen whether Mercedes have indeed stolen a march on the rest of the field.\nOn Thursday, they ran the car with the intent of putting miles on the clock and checking long-run performance without setting out to push to its limits \u2013 a task they will probably leave until the final day of testing on Saturday. Hamilton was fifth-fastest in the first session with his teammate, George Russell, ninth.",

If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d assume everyone has been basking in the glow of this epochal achievement ever since. But you do know better. You know that Kepa ended up looking quite the toolkit in the League Cup final. Again. You know that the team flirted with FA Cup humiliation at the hands of Luton. And you know that, geopolitical events having led to Roman Abramovich putting the club up for sale, an unprecedented era of success is coming to an end. Chelsea are still champions of the world for the next 11 months, of course, and whatever happens now will always have a roll of honour stretching halfway down the Kings Rahd. So, small violins and all that. Still, everything in context.\nNo, it\u2019s been downhill ever since they lifted that damned Fifa pot, and if all the aforementioned wasn\u2019t bad enough, events this morning threw a cat into a tin full of pigeons, then firmly closed the lid. Abramovich has been hit with sanctions by the UK government and had his assets frozen, plunging Chelsea into chaos. Of course, this pales into insignificance when compared to events in Ukraine, but our old pal context helps us here again \u2013 and to be fair, people are allowed to be worried about different stuff of varying importance at the same time. This decision \u2013 preposterously trumpeted on social media by the Oligarch Taskforce, the UK government seemingly now being advised by Trey Parker and Matt Stone \u2013 means Abramovich\u2019s plans to sell the club have come to an abrupt halt.\nGiven rumours that he may have sold up to the bloke running the New York Jets, this may be no bad thing for Chelsea in the long run. At least everyone has time to stop and think. But little else about the situation is ideal, with the club now operating under terms of a special licence that allows them to keep going despite the asset freeze. For example, the club are allowed to pay their staff and fulfil their fixtures: tonight\u2019s game at Norwich, scheduled to kick off at 7.30pm with Thomas Tuchel losing his rag in interviews at 7.15pm and 9.45pm, is still on. But next week\u2019s Big Cup tie in Lille, for example, is momentarily up in the air, given the club are now only allowed to spend \u00a320,000 per game on travel. Shipping a world-class squad plus staff and all their gear around the globe is twice as expensive as it sounds.\nThe club will be subject to a transfer ban (again) and won\u2019t be allowed to offer anything to Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen or Dave, all of whom are out of contract at the end of the season. The club\u2019s sponsorship with Three has been suspended, while the Stamford Bridge hotel is no longer allowed to take bookings. If nothing else, that reduces the possibility of the politically-minded reserving a room with a view to a dirty protest. Perhaps worst of all, Chelsea are no longer able to sell a single thing, from players to match tickets and other general tat. And so all of those Champions of the World T-shirts (navy/white, \u00a320) will remain piled up symbolically behind the shutters of the club megastore, gathering dust for an as-yet-unspecified period of time. If that doesn\u2019t convince you that last month\u2019s Fifa victory was cursed, nothing will.\nJoin Scott Murray for hot Big Vase last 16, first leg action from Sevilla 2-1 West Ham (5.45pm, all times GMT) \u2013 and then keep it locked for Barry Glendenning\u2019s big, er, Thursday night Big Vase-Premier League clockwatch, featuring Rangers 2-0 Red Star, Barcelona 4-2 Galatasaray, Norwich 0-2 Chelsea* and more.\n\u201cWhen I first started playing, I was the only [girl] in the whole school.

If approved, the Republican governor, Brad Little, could either sign it into law or veto it.\n\u201cWhoever knowingly removes or causes, permits, or facilitates the removal of a child from this state for the purpose of facilitating any act prohibited \u2026 by this section shall be guilty of a felony,\u201d the bill states. \u201cAny person convicted of a violation \u2026 shall be guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not more than life.\u201d\nCivil rights and LGBTQ+ advocacy campaigns condemned the proposed bill.\n\u201cBy making it impossible for doctors to provide care for their patients, transgender youth are denied the age-appropriate, best practice, medically necessary, gender-affirming care that a new study just found reduces the risk of moderate or severe depression by 60% and suicidality by 73%,\u201d Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said.\n\u201cBills like HB 675 are being pushed across the country by well-funded, national, anti-trans groups to mobilize their political base,\u201d Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said. \u201cThese bills do nothing to invest and protect Idaho youth and families and Idahoans deserve better.\u201d\nAccording to a 2019 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 2% of high school students identified as trans, and 35% had attempted suicide in the previous year.\nAccording to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills are currently under consideration in state legislatures across the country.\nState representative Bruce Skaug, the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, said that the bill was \u201cabout protecting children\u201d. He also compared gender-affirming treatments to minors drinking alcohol and getting tattoos.\nThe bill passed with a near party-line vote, with Republicans winning by 55-13. Dr Fred Wood, the House\u2019s only physician, joined 12 Democrats in voting against the bill.\n\u201cOur transgender youth are so incredibly courageous, and I know how stressful it has been for transgender youth and their families as they\u2019ve watched this bill move through this body,\u201d said the Democratic representative Lauren Neocochea during its debate.\n\u201cAn Idaho doctor has had to assist three transgender youth related to their suicide attempts since this bill has been introduced. We need to trust those parents and providers to make these deeply personal decisions,\u201d she added.\nThe Idaho vote comes as the Florida senate also passed a bill on Tuesday which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.\nLast week, a Texas judge blocked the state from investigating the parents of a trans teenager over gender-affirming treatments after the order by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, that officials look into reports of such treatments as abuse.",

        "content": "Regional hubs in England and Wales needed as waits at London clinic leave young people \u2018at considerable risk\u2019\nThe only NHS gender identity service for children in England and Wales is under unsustainable pressure as the demand for the service outstrips capacity, a review has found.\nThe interim report of the Cass Review, commissioned by NHS England in 2020, recommends that a network of regional hubs be created to provide care and support to young people with gender incongruence or dysphoria, arguing their care is \u201ceveryone\u2019s business\u201d.\nLed by the paediatrician Hilary Cass, the interim report explains that the significant rise in referrals to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London has resulted in overwhelmed staff and waiting lists of up to two years that leave young people \u201cat considerable risk\u201d of distress and deteriorating mental health. The number of referrals to the service went from 138 in 2010-11 to 2,383 in 2020-21.\nLast spring, the Care Quality Commission demanded monthly updates on numbers on waiting lists and actions to reduce them in a highly critical report on GIDS.\nDiffering views and lack of open discussion about the nature of gender incongruence in childhood and adolescence \u2013 and whether transition is always the best option \u2013 means that patients can experience a \u201cclinician lottery\u201d, says the new review, which carried out extensive interviews with professionals and those with lived experience.\nIt notes that the clinical approach used by GIDS \u201chas not been subjected to some of the usual control measures\u201d typically applied with new treatments.\nThe report says there are often tensions between the expectations of the young person \u2013 who often wants rapid access to physical interventions after a long, challenging wait to be seen \u2013 and the responsibilities of the clinician.\nAnother significant issue raised with the review team was that of \u201cdiagnostic overshadowing\u201d, whereby once a young person is identified as having gender-related distress, other complex needs \u2013 such as neurodiversity or a mental health problem that would normally be managed by local services \u2013 can be overlooked.\nWhile noting that \u201cmany of the challenges and knowledge gaps that we face in the UK are echoed internationally\u201d, the review group raises serious concerns about the lack of data collection by GIDS and more broadly, especially on outcomes for the recent increase in girls questioning their gender identity.\nIn a letter directly to children and young people at the beginning of the report, Cass assures readers that her belief is that \u201cmore services are needed for you, closer to where you live\u201d. But she also cautions them that there was \u201cstill a lot we don\u2019t know about the long-term effects\u201d of hormone treatments.\nLast September the court of appeal overturned a  judgment that children under the age of 16 were unlikely to be mature enough to give informed consent to be prescribed puberty-blocking drugs.\nCass writes that the review group will spend the next few months assessing all available information on hormone treatments. \u201cI am currently emphasising the importance of making decisions about prescribing as safe as possible. This means making sure you have all the information you need \u2013 about what we do know and what we don\u2019t know.\u201d\nRegional hubs would bring treatment closer to those who need it, allow more clinicians from a variety of backgrounds to offer support, and develop agreement and guidance about the appropriate clinical assessment process that should take place, underpinned by better data and evidence, the reports suggests.\nA spokesperson for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust welcomed \u201cthe focus of on increasing and broadening the care and support available for this group of patients who are currently waiting far too long and on developing the evidence base\u201d.",

        "content": "From player sales and contracts to sponsorships, what does Thursday\u2019s news mean for the European Champions?\nOn Thursday morning, the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, had his assets frozen as part of a range of British government sanctions against seven Russian \u201cpro-Kremlin\u201d oligarchs closely linked with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\nIt means Abramovich can no longer sell Chelsea or make money from owning them. The club are also now subject to a special government licence which strictly regulates what they can and cannot do, and makes it a criminal offence if they do not comply.\nFrom now on, only season-ticket holders and those who have already bought tickets will be allowed to attend Chelsea games. The club are no longer permitted to transfer or loan players, while broadcast and prize money is also frozen.\nOn Thursday lunchtime, the official Chelsea club shop was forced to close. However, the club can continue to play fixtures and are permitted to have \u201creasonable travel costs\u201d to and from games up to a maximum of \u00a320,000. Fans at games will still be able to buy food and drink.\nThe club were blindsided by the timing of the government\u2019s decision and, understandably, there has been some alarm among players and their agents. One dressing-room source described the situation as \u201cchaos\u201d and said people feared the club could enter administration.\nSuch talk is probably premature. However, there is certainly huge uncertainty swirling around Stamford Bridge. The men\u2019s team have three first-team players whose deals are will end in the summer: C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen. Five women\u2019s players \u2013 Ann-Katrin Berger, Maren Mjelde, Jonna Andersson, Ji So-yun and Drew Spence \u2013 are also set to leave at the end of the season.\nThat is the \u00a31bn question. Government sources have stressed that the Russian will not make a penny from any sale. Essentially, Abramovich has two choices: to sell the club he has owned since 2003 and walk away quietly as a hero to many supporters, or stay and fight, which could lead to further sanctions and the club being run down.\nEven if Abramovich decides to go gracefully, the government will have to issue another licence to allow that to happen. It is also unclear where the money \u2013 which could be more than \u00a31bn \u2013 could end up, with discussions continuing between the Treasury, the Premier League and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As one source put it: \u201cThe primary thing today is about taking action on oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin. We\u2019re working through some of those wider implications, including around a potential sale at the moment.\u201d\nThree, the British telecoms company which is the team\u2019s principal shirt sponsor on a deal believed to be worth around \u00a340m a year, has confirmed it is suspending its partnership with the club. A spokesperson said: \u201cIn light of the government\u2019s recently announced sanctions, we have requested Chelsea Football Club temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club, including the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice.\n\u201cWe recognise that this decision will impact the many Chelsea fans who follow their team passionately. However, we feel that given the circumstances, and the government sanction that is in place, it is the right thing to do. As a mobile network, the best way we can support the people of Ukraine is to ensure refugees arriving in the UK from the conflict and customers currently in Ukraine can stay connected to the people who matter to them. Therefore, we are offering connectivity packages to all Ukrainians arriving in the UK, and those in Ukraine.\u201d\nHyundai, Chelsea shirt sleeve sponsor, has also released a statement. It reads: \u201cHyundai has become one of the strongest partners in football over the years & the company supports the sport to be a force for good. We are currently assessing the situation with Chelsea FC.\u201d The car manufacturer\u2019s deal is reportedly worth \u00a310m a year.\nUndoubtedly. Chelsea are not the only Premier League club whose owners and sponsors have been called into question. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund has a majority stake in Newcastle. The Abu Dhabi United Group runs Manchester City. Meanwhile last week, Everton suspended all sponsorship deals with the Uzbek oligarch Alisher Usmanov.\nWhile the decision to impose sanctions on Abramovich was welcomed by Tracey Crouch, the MP who chaired the recent fan-led review into football governance, she said it illustrated the need for better scrutiny of owners and directors. \u201cThere has been a huge desire for this to happen,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cBut I would also say that the situation at Chelsea does demonstrate, yet again, why we need an independent regulator with really tough owners\u2019 tests,. It\u2019s not going to solve this particular problem. But a lot of the issues involved are highlighted in the fan-led review.\u201d",

The war in Ukraine has only deepened the squeeze that households will face.\n\u201cThe chancellor cannot protect the country from the economic pain that higher energy prices bring, but he can decide who bears the burden. His top priority for the spring statement should be to ensure benefits don\u2019t fall \u00a310bn behind the fast-rising cost of living.\u201d\nOther options could include a further cut to the universal credit taper rate, which Sunak reduced in his October budget, allowing claimants to keep more as their earnings go up; or unfreezing personal tax allowances, which are due to drag more people into paying higher rates.\nThe prime minister acknowledged that consumers were facing difficult months ahead, as the UK and European economies are weaned off Russian energy. \u201cNow is the time, and it may be a bumpy period, but we\u2019ll get through it as fast and well as we possibly can.\u201d\nBoris Johnson told Beth Rigby on Sky News that the government would do \u201ceverything we can to help households,\u201d including continuing to freeze fuel duty, but \u201cthe best thing for dealing with the cost of living, I mean big picture, is to have a strong economy, good high wage jobs.\u201d\nThe former Tory prime minister David Cameron has called on the government to cut taxes in the teeth of the crisis \u2013 but while Sunak has insisted he wants to be a tax-cutting chancellor, he remains committed to April\u2019s 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions to pay for health and social care.\nDomestic fuel bills are expected to rise by an average of almost \u00a3700 a year when the price cap set by the regulator Ofgem is raised in April. In response, Sunak has promised a \u00a3150 council tax rebate for properties in bands A to D next month, and a \u00a3200 cut to energy bills in October, to be repaid over five years.\nLabour have attacked the buy-now-pay-later nature of the scheme, and called for a more generous package, funded by a windfall tax on the energy companies.\nJohnson defended the plan robustly on Wednesday at prime minister\u2019s questions, but it later emerged that his team had commissioned Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s business department (BEIS) to look at ways of making it more generous.\nFirst revealed by Politico, these are understood to include doubling the energy bill cut, to \u00a3500 \u2013 but crucially, they would not be implemented until October, the next time regulator Ofgem is due to update the price cap.\nSurging oil and gas prices since Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia have led to predictions that bills could be set to soar once again in the autumn.\nBut a Treasury source said it was not yet clear whether the energy bill scheme would need to be strengthened: \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of putting together policy responses when we\u2019re not sure what the problem we\u2019re trying to solve is\u201d.\nBEIS officials stressed that it was not unusual to be asked to come up with policy options for future contingencies \u2013 but the fact Number 10 asked for the work underlines the scale of concern in government about soaring living costs.\nPrivately, many Conservative MPs say they believe Sunak\u2019s February cost of living measures now appear inadequate. \u201cIt just won\u2019t cut it,\u201d one backbencher said.\nSunak told an audience at the London School of Economics earlier this month: \u201cAs ever part of my job is always to be listening to people and making sure the policies that we\u2019ve got in place are the right ones to help the economy, to help families and people can judge me on my track record about how we do that.\u201d",

        "content": "Vladimir Putin prepares economic retaliation for western sanctions, including laws to impound $10bn of leased airline jets\nRussia has drawn up plans to seize the assets of western companies leaving the country as the Kremlin pushes back against sweeping sanctions and the exodus of international businesses since its invasion of Ukraine.\nAnnouncing the move after a string of global firms said they would suspend operations in Russia this week, including McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, the country\u2019s economic ministry said it could take temporary control of departing businesses where foreign ownership exceeds 25%.\nSpeaking in a video link with members of his government on Thursday, Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin could find legally viable ways to seize international firms. The government would push to \u201cintroduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who actually want to work,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThere are enough legal and market instruments for this.\u201d\nMikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, said that while most businesses had temporarily suspended operations, the situation would be closely monitored and that steps to \u201cintroduce an external administration\u201d could be used.\nThe move comes as western governments seek to impose maximum pressure on Putin after the invasion of Ukraine by announcing drastic restrictions on imports of Russian oil and gas on top of financial sanctions and asset freezes for prominent oligarchs.\nOn top of formal sanctions, major western businesses and high-profile brands have taken steps to either exit the country altogether or suspend operations in response to the invasion, including Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s. Shell has announced plans to withdraw from Russian oil and gas, BP has said it will exit stakes in major projects, while Unilever has said it will stop imports and exports to the country.\nBurger King announced on Thursday that it would suspend all its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain. The company does not directly operate restaurants in the country, the brand being run instead by local franchise partners.\nOutlining the Kremlin\u2019s response to its increasing international isolation, Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said it was using a \u201csymmetrical response\u201d to the sanctions imposed by the west, \u201cincluding the seizure of foreign assets and their possible nationalisation\u201d.\n\u201cThe same applies to the refusal of foreign companies to work in our country,\u201d he wrote in a post on the social media website VKontakte, accusing western firms leaving the country of being \u201cmoronic for dancing to the tune of Washington and Brussels\u201d.\nHe said Moscow would respond \u201cfundamentally and harshly\u201d to the departures, adding: \u201cWhatever the reasons for the exodus, foreign companies must understand that it will not be easy to return to our market.\u201d\nRussia announced plans on Thursday designed to exert pressure back on the west through economic sanctions, including through an export ban on timber, electronic and telecoms equipment.\nMoscow also passed laws to impound $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) of jets leased to Aeroflot and other Russian airlines by western organisations.\nIt comes as Russia heads closer to defaulting on government debt payments, with ratings agencies warning of \u201cimminent\u201d failure in a move that could lead to financial losses for holders of Russian sovereign bonds.\nThe World Bank\u2019s chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, said on Thursday that both Russia and Belarus were \u201csquare in default territory\u201d in an interview with Reuters. Fitch downgraded Russia\u2019s sovereign rating further into \u201cjunk\u201d status earlier this week, warning that the government was increasingly likely to renege on its payment commitments.\nRussia is due to make payments worth about $117m on government borrowing denominated in US dollars on Wednesday next week. However, doubts have been raised over whether the coupon payments will be made amid western sanctions on the Russian central bank and commercial lenders, as well as retaliatory steps announced by Moscow.\nReinhart said the impact for the global financial system had been limited so far, although she warned that risks could emerge in Europe. Around half of Russia\u2019s international bonds are held by foreign investors. Foreign banks have exposure of more than $121bn in Russia, much of that concentrated among European lenders, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements.\n\u201cI worry about what I do not see,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cFinancial institutions are well capitalised, but balance sheets are often opaque \u2026 There is the issue of Russian private-sector defaults.

For those who ever received any help from social care, one in 15 were not enrolled. This compares with one in 40 children who were never involved with social care services aged eight to 14. The rates of non-enrolment were even higher for those who had ever received help for special educational needs as well as social care support. In other words, the very children who have been recognised by social care services and schools as being most in need of help are the most likely to fall through the safety net and miss out on education.\nMuch more needs to be done to retain all children inclusively in education, including ensuring that schools have the resources to meet the often complex needs of the vulnerable children they care for.Matthew A JayLouise Mc Grath-LoneUCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health \n Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

        "content": "Refugees describe bureaucratic hurdles and uncertainty after exhausting journeys across Europe\nTwelve days after witnessing his home in Kharkiv being shelled by Russian forces, Sergei Koletvinov, a London-based van driver, was stopped at the Calais ferry entrance and told he could not take his family into Britain without a visa.\nHe was turned back at 2.30am on Thursday morning, and spent the rest of the night trying to sleep in his car with his wife, Oxana Lubeinoko, their two-and-a-half year old son, Simon, and their five-year-old daughter, Alissa, while parked outside a temporary Home Office advice centre in the port, turning the engine on occasionally to keep warm. They had consulted friends and Facebook sites and were under the impression that because he has permanent residency in the UK, they would have no problem crossing the border.\nA few metres away in the same car park, Svitlana Apanasenko, from Kyiv, who is eight months pregnant and nervous about going into premature labour, was also trying to get some sleep, squashed inside a minibus with seven other people. Her family had been turned back at the border in the early hours as well, halting an already long and stressful journey to safety.\nOn Thursday, amid international outcry over the UK\u2019s slow and restrictive visa arrangements for Ukrainian refugees, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced a modest reduction of the red tape involved. From next Tuesday, refugees fleeing the Russian invasion will no longer have to get their fingerprints and photographs done before travelling to the UK, and will be able to complete the application once they have arrived in Britain. The announcement followed an earlier incremental expansion of the Ukraine family visa scheme on Tuesday, extending it from immediate family to cousins, aunts, uncles and in-laws of UK-based relatives.\nHowever, these tweaks to an exacting bureaucratic process were criticised by Amnesty International as \u201ctoo little, too late, and yet more evidence of the Home Office\u2019s corrosively anti-refugee attitude\u201d.\n\u201cThe process is still full of red tape, with desperate and exhausted people still being required to provide birth certificates, proof of relationships and residence, and with everything still needing to be translated into English,\u201d said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK\u2019s chief executive, as he called for a full visa waiver.\nBecause they will only begin next week, the changes offered little comfort to the hundreds of refugees currently stuck in northern France while they try to get appointments in UK visa application centres in Paris, or across the border in Belgium, before facing a wait of up to five days to see if their application is approved.\nThroughout Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Ukrainian refugees continued to be turned away at the UK border at the Calais ferry port. By 11am, Koletvinov had been seen by some Home Office staff, and was waiting to be taken by bus to Lille with his family to submit biometric data for the visa at a temporary centre. No one was able to tell him how long the application process might take. The family had eaten nothing since Wednesday except for Kit Kats offered by UK border officials.\n\u201cThis has been the worst time of my life,\u201d he said, grey-faced and trembling from exhaustion, scrolling through messages on his phone, showing images of the ruined buildings near his block of flats, every window blown out. He said he was too tired to feel anger at the unexpected bureaucracy preventing the family from crossing the Channel. Koletvinov, who has been working in the UK for eight years, spending a few weeks a year with his wife and children in Ukraine, was with his family when the Russian attack began; they took just 15 minutes to pack up and leave.\nHe said the uncertainty over when or whether they would be granted visas was hard to process. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. His children busied themselves with colouring books and crayons on the floor of the port building, climbing over and under the waiting room\u2019s metal seats, oblivious to their parents\u2019 unease. He plans to rent a bigger flat in London and find better-paid work to support his family. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anything; we just want to be safe,\u201d he said.\nAlla Berliuta, an assistant at a care home in Southampton, had spent the last week driving with her husband, Andrii, an alarm fitter, who like her has permanent residency in the UK, to rescue relatives from a town just outside Kyiv. She collected her heavily pregnant sister, Svitlana Apanasenko, her 15-year-old niece, a sister-in-law, a brother-in-law and a two-year-old nephew, from the border with Moldova, but they were forced to reroute via Romania to visit a UK visa application centre there and be fingerprinted.\nThe hurdles required to secure a UK visa have slowed them down and heightened the stressfulness of the experience. \u201cNo one understands the visa system. It\u2019s so new and we were given different advice at different times. My brain feels a bit boiled by everything. I\u2019ve been so worried about my sister because her pregnancy has been very complicated and she needs a caesarean,\u201d Berliuta said. She was also worried that the visa-related delays to the journey would put her care-worker job at risk, although she said that her employers, Allied Healthcare, had been very understanding.\nBecause the family had already visited the visa appointment centre in Romania, Home Office staff were able to finalise their visas, and they were able to board a ferry to the UK early on Thursday afternoon. Elsewhere in Calais, however, other Ukrainian families were still waiting.\nThe French interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, has accused Britain of being \u201ca bit inhumane\u201d and urged ministers to \u201cstop the technocratic nitpicking\u201d, a stance that was echoed by several refugees.\n\u201cThe response has been far too slow and far too complicated,\u201d Taras Bednarchuk said, furious to have been turned away from the Eurotunnel by UK Border Force staff. He and his brother Misha, both of whom are long-term UK residents and work in construction, had driven to Warsaw to collect their 17-year-old brother, who had been studying software engineering in Ternopil in Ukraine before fleeing; they had not realised he would need a visa.\nVera Pitchuk, who has been working as a cleaner in London for the past six months, had collected her two sons, five and nine, from Ukraine, where they were being looked after by their grandmother, and brought them to Calais by coach from Poland. Her family and 10 other refugees were taken off the coach at the UK passport control at the ferry port because they had no visas. They had been obliged to travel from Calais back to Paris to submit an application there on Wednesday and were waiting to hear if they would be granted entry; it was not clear whether she was eligible for the family scheme, which does not apply to workers on short-term visas.\n\u201cI hope everything will be fine. We have already been through a lot,\u201d she said.\nA new visa application centre will be opened on Friday in Arras, 70 miles east of Calais, the Home Office announced, in order to keep refugees away from the port city. \u201cTo support those people in Calais who are eligible for the scheme, we have worked closely with the French to set up a new, larger temporary visa application centre in Arras for referrals only,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nOfficials said that more than 1,000 UK visas had now been granted in centres across Europe. The UN estimates that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine.",

        "content": "Emmanuel Macron says \u2018we must be vigilant\u2019 despite eastern member states wanting to show Ukraine \u2018path is open to them\u2019\nEmmanuel Macron has led western European leaders in rebuffing appeals from Volodymyr Zelenskiy for fast-track EU membership for Ukraine despite the backing of eastern member states.\nAt a summit in Versailles, the 27 EU countries acknowledged as one the \u201ctectonic shift in European history\u201d caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbour and vowed to bolster their military might and \u201cstrengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership\u201d with Kyiv.\nBut calls from Ukraine\u2019s president, supported by Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, for a special membership process failed to convince France, Germany, Spain or the Netherlands.\nFrance\u2019s president said he wanted to \u201csend a strong signal in this period to Ukraine and to the Ukrainians\u201d of solidarity but \u201cat the same time, we must be vigilant\u201d, adding that he did not believe it possible to \u201copen an accession procedure with a country at war\u201d.\n\u201cShould we close the door and say never, it would be unfair,\u201d he said.\nMark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told reporters there was no prospect of the EU membership for Ukraine in the short term. He said: \u201cAll countries in the western part of Europe that I speak to say that you shouldn\u2019t try to have a fast-track procedure or accelerated accession process \u2026\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that Ukraine has asked to be member of the EU \u2026 There is no fast-track procedure to become a member of the EU.\u201d\nWestern European governments opposed to rushing to EU candidacy status are concerned by the widespread corruption in Ukraine, the lack of stability in its institutions, and its parlous economic state. The experience in being unable to act in relation to the democratic deficit in Hungary and Poland has put off a number of capitals from any enlargement before big reforms of the bloc\u2019s decision-making mechanisms.\nGermany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, suggested that the EU was not ready for enlargement as its decision-making was still rooted in unanimity.\nThere was no immediate response from Kyiv. The EU member states have asked the European Commission to give an assessment of Ukraine\u2019s membership application, which could take up to 18 months to complete.\nThe Latvian prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, whose country shares a border with Russia, said Ukraine should join the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey in being granted candidate status, although that would be the start of a \u201clong road\u201d to membership.\n\u201cIt is important to show a clear, open door for EU membership for Ukraine, that the path is open for them to take,\u201d he said.\nThe leaders were meeting in France just hours after talks between Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Turkey ended in stalemate.\nMacron, who has staged a number of lengthy calls with Putin before and after Russia\u2019s president launched his invasion, told reporters he would continue to talk with Moscow but that he was not hopeful of a breakthrough.\nHe said: \u201cI do not see a diplomatic solution in the next few hours or the next few days, but we will speak again with President Putin in the next few days, try to see if things move on either side, and so we will continue to remain engaged with a lot of strength \u2026\n\u201cI have to confess that the conditions that he puts on the table aren\u2019t acceptable to anybody, to be honest.\n\u201cThe questions is whether Mr Putin is ready to engage himself and we will work genuinely collectively \u2026 When I look at the facts, the facts are the following: Russia decided to launch war; Russia has bombed Ukraine; Russia is bombing civilians; and in parallel you have negotiations, but the negotiations are not ready to be completed.\u201d\nHe described the Russian airstrike on a Mariupol maternity hospital as a \u201ca shameful and amoral act of war\u201d.\nJosep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said Putin was engaged in a \u201ccrazy war\u201d and was \u201cindiscriminately\u201d shelling civilians and \u201cbombing and destroying a country\u201d as it had done in Syria.\nThe EU\u2019s leaders discussed a variety of ways in which economic and political ties could be strengthened with Ukraine, ranging from a seat for the Ukrainian leadership at some EU meetings to membership of the Erasmus student exchange programme.\nThey also focused on how to reduce the bloc\u2019s dependency on Russian gas and oil. In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of its gas imports and close to 40% of the bloc\u2019s total gas consumption.\nThe EU has already imposed unprecedented punitive measures on key parts of the Russian economy and hundreds of politicians, officials and oligarchs.\nAccording to a draft summit communique seen by the Guardian, the leaders are expected to warn Moscow that they \u201care ready to move quickly with further sanctions if needed\u201d.\nIn Moscow, Putin warned that their sanctions against Russia would rebound by raising the price of food and energy. He said: \u201cThese sanctions would have been imposed in any case. There are some questions, problems and difficulties, but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them now.\n\u201cIn the end, this will all lead to an increase in our independence, self-sufficiency and our sovereignty.\u201d",

Kelly, who has been writing plays since 2008, said \u201clike many others in the arts, during the pandemic, I had a complete crisis of faith \u2026 So to go from that point to receiving recognition from such an amazing prize and panel of judges is genuinely a dream come true.\u201d\nLiterary agent Mel Kenyon chaired the judging panel, which included the Guardian\u2019s chief theatre critic Arifa Akbar, playwright Lucy Kirkwood and Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker.\nThe award, now in its second year, is vital \u201cin today\u2019s theatre ecology\u201d, said Kelly, who received the prize of \u00a312,000 at a ceremony on Thursday at the London Library. \u201cWe really do need programmes that highlight female and female-identifying voices. I\u2019m so proud to be a part of its legacy.\u201d\nMore than 850 scripts were entered for the prize, which is produced by Ellie Keel and the touring theatre company Paines Plough. Keel called Consumed \u201cwarm, funny, deft and sharply observed\u201d, and added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way still to go in terms of parity between male and female writers on major stages and I hope that the exceptional plays brought together under the banner of this prize demonstrate that there\u2019s no shortage of talent: only, in some places, a reluctance to recognise it or give it a chance.\u201d Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett, joint artistic directors of Paines Plough, said they had called each other after reading Consumed and found they had \u201cboth been howling with laughter, moved and shocked all within the first 10 pages\u201d.\nConsumed is set to be programmed in 2023. In 2020, the prize\u2019s inaugural year, two scripts won: Amy Trigg\u2019s Reasons You Should(n\u2019t) Love Me, which was later staged at the Kiln theatre in London, and Ahlam\u2019s You Bury Me, which had a staged reading during last year\u2019s Edinburgh international festival.",

        "content": "This was a game of fine margins and in the end it belonged to the side with greater European expertise. Sevilla were everything we have come to expect in this competition \u2013 clinical when the moment arrived, obdurate enough to hold out once they were ahead \u2013 and the question now is whether West Ham are capable of learning a few tricks of their own before this absorbing tie resumes at the London Stadium next week.\nThe challenge is daunting. Caught cold when a clever set-piece routine allowed Munir El Haddadi to give Sevilla the lead with a sweet strike on the hour, the primary emotion for West Ham was frustration. David Moyes\u2019s side missed several excellent chances in both halves and, while they will back themselves to turn this last-16 tie around, they know that their European adventure will be over if their finishing does not improve.\nCrucially, though, they still have belief. The underdogs were beaten, but they were not disgraced. They created enough to suggest they can still upset the odds and it is worth taking a moment to consider how far they have come since appointing Moyes two years ago.\nAfter all, this, a glamour tie against opponents who more or less own this competition, was unfamiliar territory. West Ham have been more accustomed to battling relegation than competing on the European stage and it would have been understandable if there had been a few nerves at kick-off, a few players in claret and blue wondering if they truly deserved to be at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Piju\u00e1n, where there is no shortage of reminders that Sevilla have won the Europa League six times.\nYet there is a robustness to West Ham these days and they did not look out of their depth during the first half. Their football was crisp and their boldness unsettled Sevilla at times, particularly with Michail Antonio running the channels and doing everything possible to ruffle a defence that looked vulnerable with Nemanja Gudelj alongside Jules Kound\u00e9 instead of the injured Diego Carlos.\nThe early action was end-to-end, the first jabs coming from Sevilla. Yet while West Ham were fortunate not to fall behind when El Haddadi headed wide from Jes\u00fas Navas\u2019s cross, the visitors had their moments. Antonio was a nuisance, barging past Gudelj before shooting wide, and West Ham seemed certain to take the lead when Declan Rice nodded Manuel Lanzini\u2019s free-kick into the six-yard box, only for Nikola Vlasic to head too close to Bono.\nIt was a bad miss but West Ham were causing problems. Rice was working well with Tomas Soucek after recovering from a stomach upset. The full-backs, Aaron Cresswell and Ben Johnson, had freedom to support the attack and there were more encouraging moments for West Ham before half-time, Bono pushing an effort from Vlasic wide and Antonio\u2019s cross just evading Soucek.\nWest Ham, who need Jarrod Bowen to recover from an achilles injury before the second leg, had to be more clinical. Sevilla were without several important players and their problems increased when Ivan Rakitic fell ill during the warm-up, El Haddadi coming in for the influential midfielder, but the hosts still had plenty of threats.\nEl Haddadi was lively, sliding a shot just wide, and West Ham had another escape when Youssef En-Nesyri eluded Kurt Zouma and Craig Dawson. Alphonse Areola responded sharply to the striker\u2019s header.\nThe game was nicely balanced at the break. West Ham had settled, Rice winning his tackles and oozing confidence. Gaps appeared and they went close at the start of the second half, Antonio teeing up Soucek to draw another fine save from Bono.\nSevilla were in a game. Sensing danger, their fans increased the noise. Julen Lopetegui was whipping his players up and West Ham had to retreat, their defence breathing a sigh of relief when En Nesyri spurned another good headed chance.\nHad West Ham\u2019s moment passed? Their finishing has been wasteful in recent weeks. Sevilla had started to press more and West Ham were edgy, the signs ominous when Zouma conceded a free-kick after being played into trouble deep on the right.\nA goal was coming. Marcos Acu\u00f1a trotted across from left-back to take the free-kick and West Ham momentarily forget themselves, nobody spotting El Haddadi lurking on the left of the area. Nobody, that is, apart from Acu\u00f1a, whose delivery caught West Ham out and sat up perfectly for El Haddadi to clip a beautiful finish.\nIt was a sloppy goal and they were fortunate not to fall further behind when Lucas Ocampos curled a shot narrowly wide. Something had to change. Moyes replaced Vlasic with Sa\u00efd Benrahma and West Ham improved, Lanzini denied an equaliser by a heroic block from Navas. Not for the first time, the finishing touch had eluded them. It needs to return next Thursday.",

Conflicted Theatre\u2019s unnerving comedy is inspired by the 2001 case of Armin Meiwes, who killed and ate a man he found online. Crucially, the man on the menu agreed to the whole affair. Featuring a present-day copycat version of Meiwes\u2019s fantasy, this disturbing two-hander is surprisingly funny, laced with an edge of something metallic.\nThis weekend-long date between ready-to-eat Sam (Pedro Leandro) and unashamed cannibal Nick (Eddie Loodmer-Elliott) takes place in a makeshift kitchen with a backdrop of murder-scene plastic. Written by both actors with director Evan Lordan, there is a lightness to the dialogue, their natural first-date chatter moving seamlessly between the best way to cook a carbonara and how to saut\u00e9 a human thigh. References to flavour recur in Nick\u2019s speech, as if his desire for human meat is an indicator of the very finest of tastes.\nFor something so provocative, this human flesh dinner date is surprisingly gentle. Leandro in particular is magnetic, his affable humour side-by-side with his intense vulnerability. But for this play to really work, it has to convince us, however briefly, that what they\u2019re doing is the right thing for them. The closest we come to believing is when Sam learns he\u2019s not the first to have gotten this far, and is heartbroken at not being special; we finally get a glimpse of what this horrific event means to him. It\u2019s a shame the moments of raw openness are over-reliant on the ready-made 36 questions to fall in love, which do a lot of the writers\u2019 jobs for them.\nThere\u2019s an interesting absence of sex, as the play suggests the men\u2019s desire to be bonded by flesh goes far beyond any fetish, but this isn\u2019t explored deeply enough before the offhand humour returns. The constant downplaying of the situation is what gives the play its vibrant comedy, but it also serves as a barrier to true understanding. As such, the show can\u2019t persuade us that Nick isn\u2019t ultimately psychopathic, and that Sam wouldn\u2019t benefit from several rounds of therapy. Without a nugget of belief in the final action, the attempt for transcendence just ends up feeling desperately sad.\nAt Omnibus theatre, London, until 25 March.",

        "content": "Sadler\u2019s Wells, LondonA terrifically varied programme began by pairing daring new work from Brigel Gjoka and Rauf Yasit with Lucinda Childs\u2019 iconic 1979 Dance\nThe astonishingly rich programme of the first Dance Reflections festival, spread across three major London venues, is an opportunity not only to see a range of what you might call non-classical dance, but to catch cross-currents between artists, styles and times. Its opening night paired a brand new creation with an iconic work from 1979.\nContemporary dancer Brigel Gjoka and \u201cabstract b-boy\u201d Rauf \u201cRubberLegz\u201d Yasit first met as performers in William Forsythe\u2019s superlative Quiet Evening of Dance, and their duet Neighbours echoes its trajectory: a stark opening section, dense with motion but performed in plain clothes and unadorned by music, gives way to more theatrically lit, dressed and accompanied dances, flush with moods and meanings. It\u2019s like seeing the work\u2019s bones first, and only then its flesh.\nThe bones, here, are not only the two distinctive performers \u2013 Gjoka both poised and fleet, Yasit slipping through the ribbony knots of his own limbs \u2013 but also the remarkable detail of their interaction: little parries and feints, locks and tugs and weaves. When it arrives, the spellbinding music (played live by Ru\u015fan Filiztek) layers Turkic drones, chants and beats over the dance, and suddenly we not only see the physical structure of this particular encounter, but seem to sense a place, people, histories that are elusive, but potent.\nLucinda Childs\u2019 now classic Dance (performed here by the Lyon Opera Ballet) was made in an era when systems theory and structuralism were in the zeitgeist \u2013 and it shows. The work is all about composition: the relation of one element to another, the formation of complexity from simplicity. Dressed in celestial white, the dancers use a limited lexicon throughout \u2013 little more than step, hop, skip and jump \u2013 balletically styled, and performed without affect or affectation. In section one, they skim from side to side across the stage. In section two, a soloist travels either in a straight line, or in a circle. In section three, the groups square up, or do diagonals.\nAround, in front and above them, a reshot version of Sol LeWitt\u2019s original film of the work multiplies the dancing figures as well as their angle and scale. It\u2019s all of a piece with Philip Glass\u2019s music: steps, images, bodies and sounds refracted into cosmic harmonics that echo in the mind long after the performance is over.\nThe Dance Reflections festival continues at Sadler\u2019s Wells, the Royal\n    Opera House and Tate Modern until 23 March.",

        "content": "Chelsea players are fearful about their futures after an extraordinary day on which Roman Abramovich was hit with government sanctions and the mobile phone company Three suspended its sponsorship of the club.\nThe government\u2019s decision to freeze Abramovich\u2019s assets \u2013 and bar him from selling the club for the time being \u2013 plunged Chelsea into a state of limbo, with one dressing-room source describing the atmosphere as \u201cchaos\u201d and some worried that the club could go into administration.\nThe Guardian also understands some of the players are concerned about the direction of the club and, by extension, their own futures, and are desperate for clarity. They are alarmed because one of the stipulations that has arisen from the sanctions is that Chelsea are unable to sign players or renew existing contracts.\nOn a day of uncertainty and confusion, Chelsea were:\n Blindsided by the government\u2019s decision on Thursday morning to freeze Abramovich\u2019s assets because of the oligarch\u2019s ties with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Abramovich will now need approval from the UK government before selling the Stamford Bridge club.\n Told they could compete only under a special licence that will allow them to fulfil their fixtures, but will force the club to cease many of its commercial activities, including future ticket sales, and see its broadcast money frozen.\n Hit by Three suspending its sponsorship, including the removal of its brand from shirts and around the stadium \u201cuntil further notice\u201d.\n Were banned from signing players and new contracts.\nThe men\u2019s team have three important first-team players whose deals are set to end in the summer \u2013 C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen. The women\u2019s team have five squad members whose contracts expire at the end of the season: Ann-Katrin Berger, Maren Mjelde, Jonna Andersson, Ji So-yun and Drew Spence. Christensen is believed to have an agreement in principle to join Barcelona as a free agent. Neither the men\u2019s manager, Thomas Tuchel, nor the women\u2019s, Emma Hayes, is understood to be considering their futures at the club at the moment.\nOn Thursday afternoon Chelsea held talks with the government in the hope of softening some of the restrictions it faces \u2013 including a \u00a320,000 limit on costs for away matches. But while the government is understood to be receptive to making some changes, it has been made crystal clear that Abramovich cannot benefit in any way.\nThe government is open to considering an application for a new licence that would permit a new owner at Stamford Bridge if a suitable bid emerges, but Abramovich will not be permitted to profit from any sale.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2022/03/10-54431-gnl.fw.20220310.jg.psgchampionsleaguecollapseagain.mp3\nHowever, much of the detail is yet to be decided, including where the proceeds of a deal could end up.\nDiscussions continue between the Treasury, the Premier League and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. One source said: \u201cThe primary thing today is about taking action on oligarchs with close ties to the Kremlin. We\u2019re working through some of those wider implications at the moment.\u201d\nIn a private letter to Conservative MPs, seen by the Guardian, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, made it clear the government wanted to ensure that Chelsea survived, and saw the club as a cultural asset. \u201cThe government understands that today\u2019s sanctions will have a direct impact on the club, its fans and the wider football pyramid,\u201d Dorries wrote. \u201cWe have therefore been working hard to ensure that the national game, the Premier League, the club and its fans are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions.\u201d\nIt is understood the decision to impose sanctions on Abramovich, which was announced on Thursday morning, has not deterred potential bidders. Sources said a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss has not ended its interest in buying Chelsea. The British property tycoon Nick Candy has also been working on putting a bid together and representatives for Muhsin Bayrak have said the Turkish businessman remains determined to buy the club.\nFor the time being, though, Chelsea are in turmoil. Abramovich cannot put any money into the club or take any out of it. The 55-year-old has given Chelsea \u00a31.5bn worth of loans since buying them in 2003. The club\u2019s latest accounts revealed a loss of \u00a3145.6m in the last financial year, although that was put down to the impact of the pandemic.\nFunding is provided by Fordstam Limited, a company owned by Abramovich. As one source said: \u201cWho would buy a club with a \u00a31.5bn loan hanging over it?\u201d\nThe UK has targeted Abramovich as part of its response to Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. In a document published by the government in the morning, Chelsea\u2019s owner was identified as \u201ca pro-Kremlin oligarch\u201d and was said to be \u201cassociated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, namely Vladimir Putin, with whom Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades\u201d.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2022/03/10-54431-gnl.fw.20220310.jg.psgchampionsleaguecollapseagain.mp3\nAbramovich, under whose ownership Chelsea have won 21 trophies, put the club up for sale last week. He appointed the New York-based bank the Raine Group to oversee the process. The Times has reported that lawyers for the Raine Group had contacted all interested parties after the government\u2019s announcement that \u201cthe process has been paused as the parties consider the implications of the developments and discuss the next steps with the relevant UK authorities\u201d.\nThere has been speculation Chelsea\u2019s next owners will come from America. Woody Johnson, the owner of the NFL\u2019s New York Jets, is reportedly readying a bid. Thomas Ricketts, chair of MLB\u2019s Chicago Cubs, has been mentioned and there is reported interest from Josh Harris, whose companies own the NBA\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL\u2019s New Jersey Devils, although his stake in Crystal Palace could be a complicating factor.\nA spokesperson for the Chelsea Supporters\u2019 Trust said: \u201cThe CST notes with concern the government\u2019s statement regarding the owner. Supporters must be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fan base. The CST implores the government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea\u2019s future, and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.\u201d\nAbramovich\u2019s spokesperson has been approached for comment.",

It seems that the show really does go on \u2013 for now anyway \u2013 as on a crisp, clear Norfolk evening the players of Chelsea dished up an entertaining 3-1 Premier League defeat of an energetic Norwich.\nWelcome to Chelsea, the afterlife: a place that felt, as the Norwich fans sang about dirty Russian money, like another lurch into the deeply strange parallel timeline of football and geopolitics in the year 2022.\nNews of the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich had emerged shortly after 9am on Thursday morning. By lunchtime the boulevards of Norwich\u2019s pedestrianised city centre were thronged with Chelsea supporters singing the blues away. We\u2019ve got Tommy Tuchel: he knows just what to do. In which case, perhaps he could share it with the rest of us. Because nothing right now makes a great deal of sense.\nAs Chelsea\u2019s away fans kept up an early wave of noise close to kick off there was a valedictory, Viking Funeral-style air about their boisterous good spirits, a sense of good cheer, of event-glamour about all this. Humans are odd creatures. Give us a tribe, a hill to die on: any hill, and often that\u2019s enough.\nTuchel had picked an everyday Chelsea team for this most otherworldly of occasions, rotating some key parts but retaining the first choice forward line that sees Kai Havertz settled as the focal point. Tuchel could be excused feeling a little demob-unhappy. One thing does seem certain: Chelsea finally have a manager they can\u2019t, under current UK law, actually sack.\nOtherwise it was business as usual. With one minute gone at Carrow Road Chelsea\u2019s fans were singing \u201cRoman Abramovich\u201d. With two minutes gone they were singing \u201cWe\u2019ve won it all\u201d, greeted by chants of \u201cYou\u2019ve lost it all\u201d from the Norwich fans. With three minutes gone they were 1-0 up, Trevoh Chalobah heading in Mason Mount\u2019s corner. Say what you like about the oligarchical system of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia: it has helped create a very effective football team.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2022/03/10-54431-gnl.fw.20220310.jg.psgchampionsleaguecollapseagain.mp3\nWith 14 minutes gone Mount made it 2-0, teed up by Havertz who looked, as he has done lately, a whirl of ceaseless movement and sharp edges close to goal. And as the game drifted on there was time to reflect on one of the strangest days in English football history, the day the most successful Premier League cub of the past two decades became, at a stroke, a distressed asset.\nThere are two points worth making about all this. First, the government\u2019s decision to sanction seven Russian oligarchs has little to do with Chelsea. What is or isn\u2019t fair for football fans makes up a tiny portion of this picture. Unrecoverable hotel costs? Northing to do on Saturday? Tell it to the besieged civilians of Ukraine.\nAnd secondly, Chelsea are, for the time being, absolutely cooked. The club can\u2019t generate income, can\u2019t manage the payroll, can\u2019t sell any tickets (those stacks of unsold Chelsea tickets have now become non-fungible tokens, to be traded for curiosity value, like a stopped watch from the deck of the Titanic).\nThe players were getting on a plane at Gatwick when news broke that this entity, this endlessly giving hand, had been chopped off at the knees by the British government. How many calls had been made by lunchtime to Reece James\u2019s agent? How will Chelsea\u2019s players make that \u00a320,000 away day allowance stretch after this final Norfolk blow-out? Get the room service. Dismantle the trouser press. For tomorrow we\u2019re in the serviced apart-hotels. There is at least something brilliantly prescient about Chelsea\u2019s choice of Liquidator as the pre-match music at Stamford Bridge.\nAnd really the key point here is the sheer suddenness. Really? Has the government only now discerned that Chelsea\u2019s owner of the past 19 years is, in its own words, \u201cconnected\u201d to Vladimir Putin? Had this not triggered any alarms? Did nobody have a word with the Premier League? Abramovich has not suddenly declared his fealty to his sovereign lord. He remains the same oddly mute, oddly sphinx-like presence. Plus of course right now there is nothing to stop it happening again. Finance a war criminal. It\u2019s all good. Welcome to the greatest league in the world.\nIt has to be said, Chelsea\u2019s players were undaunted, unscrambled, and hungrily engaged with the task in hand. It wouldn\u2019t be a total surprise, would it, to see them go on and win the Champions League again under this cloud, to hear Roman\u2019s name sung down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Would that feel good? Does it still feel glorious?\nNobody in the away end here seemed to mind, even if Chelsea were made to hold on as Norwich pushed hard after pulling one back though Teemu Pukki\u2019s penalty. Havertz\u2019s late third killed the game. And Chelsea, for now, roll on.",

But they reserved their sternest criticism for Randstad, the Dutch multinational service provider given a contract to administer the scheme by the Department for Education (DfE) last year.\nThe committee says it has \u201chuge concerns\u201d over Randstad\u2019s ability to meet the targets it was set. The NTP is said to have reached just 15% of its overall target so far.\n\u201cThe NTP is missing its overall target to deliver tuition to 2 million children. When Randstad appeared before us, they were unable to provide us with figures setting out who was accessing the NTP,\u201d the committee said. \u201cIf the NTP is not meeting its targets, the [DfE] should terminate its contract with Randstad.\u201d\nMPs said the \u00a35bn funding was not being spent wisely. \u201cBy not providing support for those most in need, the government risks baking in deepening inequalities between disadvantaged children and their better-off peers.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Schools Week reported that Randstad had removed a requirement to reach 65% of disadvantaged children from its contracts with tutoring providers.\nRobert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the education committee, said: \u201cThe government must ensure Randstad shapes up, or boot them out. The catch-up programme must be shown to be reaching disadvantaged pupils and this data must be published.\u201d\nThe DfE said new statistics about the NTP\u2019s operation would be published on Friday.\nBridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the poor design of the NTP meant ministers were \u201cpouring taxpayers\u2019 money down the drain\u201d.\n\u201cOur children have been an afterthought for the Tories throughout the pandemic and are now being neglected in our recovery,\u201d Phillipson said.\nAnne Longfield, the former children\u2019s commissioner, said the report showed the government\u2019s response had been \u201chaphazard, unambitious and mired in bureaucracy\u201d, with deprived and vulnerable children at risk of being left further behind.\n\u201cIt is time to deliver what was promised after schools reopened post-lockdown and make children\u2019s recovery the priority it should be. That should include being prepared to dismiss those who are being paid millions to run a catch-up plan, if that plan is not doing its job,\u201d Longfield said.\nNatalie Perera, the chief executive of the Education Policy Institute, said: \u201cThe scope and ambition of the government\u2019s wider \u00a35bn catch-up programme continues to fall short of what the evidence tells us is needed. Our research has shown that an education recovery package of \u00a313.5bn is required to support pupils in England.\u201d\nA DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to work with Randstad to ensure as many children from all backgrounds \u2013 in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 across the country can benefit from high-quality tutoring and catch up on lost learning.\u201d\nKaren Guthrie, Ranstad\u2019s senior programme director for the NTP, said she was \u201cencouraged to see an increase in the number of packages delivered\u201d.\n\u201cWe are working closely with schools across the country who are best placed to select pupils that need tuition the most. We have been working in partnership with the DfE, schools and tuition partners to look at how we can improve the programme moving forward to best serve the needs of schools,\u201d Guthrie said.",

        "content": "Wolves ended their run of three successive defeats with a comfortable win over Watford, just as they had done in September, on a night when they equalled their biggest Premier League win to consolidate their place among the chasing pack, four points behind fifth place.\nR\u00faben Neves\u2019s sumptuous chip five minutes from time allowed Wolves to match their 4-0 win over Blackpool in 2011 on a night that Ben Foster will probably want to forget as Watford\u2019s good run on the road came to an abrupt halt.\nThe former West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, who celebrated Watford\u2019s FA Cup semi-final win over these opponents three years ago with a tweet mentioning Wo1ve5 in memory of the Baggies\u2019 5-1 win at Molineux in Mick McCarthy\u2019s final game here in 2012, was harangued all evening long by the Wolves fans and gave away the ball for Daniel Podence to make it 3-0 in the 21st minute.\nWolves had won 2-0 at Vicarage Road after losing their opening three games under Bruno Lage at the start of the season, going on to produce top-six form before a recent trio of setbacks prefaced this improved performance.\nRa\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez opened the scoring before Cucho Hern\u00e1ndez put past his own keeper but the goal of the night came late on when Neves, having taken one touch to steady himself on receiving Chiquinho\u2019s header back, advanced into the penalty area as if he was going to blast his shot only to dink it over Foster\u2019s head into the top corner. It was a sublime moment, the cherry on the icing, from a 24-year-old whom his manager believes can reach the top of his profession.\n\u201cI think he misses his chance of shooting when he came inside,\u201d Lage said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important for R\u00faben. He knows what I want from him, and what I want for his career. He should be the top of the top. So now the challenge is to come with another good performance against Everton. We\u2019re training the way we play tonight. It\u2019s not about the result, it\u2019s about the way we play because I believe that gives us goals and points.\u201d\nWatford remain in the middle of the relegation zone, with one win in 17 games, three points off 17th-placed Everton having played three more games. Their record as defensive misers on the road since Roy Hodgson took over was in tatters inside the first quarter of the game as Wolves refound their attacking swagger.\nThree goals in an eight-minute burst left Watford \u201cstaring down the barrel of a gun,\u201d according to their manager, who blamed the goals on individual errors.\nJim\u00e9nez, recalled to the starting lineup after missing the last two defeats, opened the scoring with a neat right-foot trap and left-foot finish after Hwang Hee-chan burst on to Podence\u2019s touch into the left side of the penalty area to cross short and low to his strike partner.\nWolves looked much more dynamic with the Mexican striker back down the middle, and with Jonny, on his first start for a year, and Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri advancing down the flanks at every opportunity. When Jonny cut back inside down the right wing and crossed left-footed to the opposite wing-back, A\u00eft-Nouri\u2019s pullback was diverted into his own goal by Hern\u00e1ndez.\nWatford had been seeking to equal their top-flight club record of three consecutive clean sheets away from home but their defensive confidence was clearly shattered. Foster, in particular, was getting brickbats from the home fans and when the former England goalkeeper, under pressure from Jim\u00e9nez following a bobbling back pass, shanked his attempted clearance, Podence calmly collected the ball 25 yards out and lobbed it into the empty net. How the Wolves fans gloated. \u201cFoster, Foster, what\u2019s the score?\u201d was one of their more polite enquiries.\nThe second half turned into something of a pantomime. Lage was quicker to respond to the South Bank\u2019s calls for a wave than Foster who sent another miskick to Podence, this time 60 yards out. The Wolves\u2019 No 10 still went for the lob from the centre circle, Foster back-pedalling in time to take the catch.\nHodgson agreed Foster had a poor game but did not castigate him. \u201cHe would be the first to put his hand up,\u201d his manager at West Brom said. \u201cHe has been vitally important in every respect, with his performances and the way he is. As a keeper, you are a hero or a zero. He has been a hero a number of times, this was the other side of the coin. If you want to be anonymous, get yourself in midfield.\u201d",

It was a very embarrassing situation for the American navy. Luckily there was no major accident, nothing happened, nothing exploded.\n\u201cBut when you\u2019re dealing with nuclear anything, you\u2019ve got to be [more cautious].\u201d\nThe phenomenon of jellyfish shutdowns is surprisingly common in any power plant that sucks in water as a coolant.\nGershwin says any base for a submarine with an in-built nuclear reactor could not be enclosed like Moreton Bay, which is sheltered by Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island.\n\u201cJellyfish act like plastic,\u201d Gershwin said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen a pool filter that\u2019s got a plastic wrapper caught, it clogs up \u2026 and floods all over the place because it\u2019s not going through the filter. The water gets stopped by this \u2018plastic\u2019 and then the water can\u2019t pass by that. Emergency shutdowns of power plants happen all the time, very frequently.\u201d\nGershwin said that if Brisbane was used to base nuclear submarines, a jellyfish shutdown would be \u201cinevitable\u201d.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many things as a scientist that I would say are inevitable, but this is. I couldn\u2019t tell you what day or time it would happen, but I can tell you it would happen.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be really careful about where you put these things. Anywhere that you\u2019ve got warm water, you\u2019re going to have jellyfish. Moreton Bay is just sucked in with jellyfish.\u201d\nBrisbane ranked eighth of the sites considered by Defence as a potential submarine base in 2011, with Sydney listed as the best choice.\nDefence said nuclear-powered submarines would have systems in place \u201cto prevent the disruption of functionality from foreign matter being sucked into cooling systems\u201d.\n\u201cThe commonwealth will write formally to the respective state governments to seek their engagement with feasibility activity, including formal community engagement,\u201d a spokesperson said.",

These are calculated by looking at the difference between the number of deaths recorded from all causes and the number of expected based on previous patterns.\n\u201cOur estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality suggest the mortality impact from the Covid-19 pandemic has been more devastating than the situation documented by official statistics,\u201d say the co-authors, who were led by Dr Haidong Wang, an associate professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\n\u201cOfficial statistics on reported Covid-19 deaths provide only a partial picture of the true burden of mortality. While the official Covid-19 death toll was 5.9 million between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, the new study estimates that 18.2 million excess deaths occurred over the same period, suggesting the full impact may have been greater.\u201d\nThe research is based on what Wang and his collaborators say are the first peer-reviewed estimates of excess deaths due to the pandemic in 191 countries and territories.\nPrevious research from Sweden and the Netherlands has found that Covid-19 directly caused most of the excess deaths found there.\nIf their estimate is correct, then \u201cthe global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the Covid-19 pandemic was 120.2 deaths per 100,000 of the population and [the] excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100,000 of the population in 21 countries\u201d.\nGlobally, South Asia (5.3m), north Africa and the Middle East (1.7m) and eastern Europe (1.4m) had the largest number of excess deaths.\nIn terms of absolute numbers, India had more excess deaths due to Covid-19 than anywhere else \u2013 4.07m \u2013 according to the findings. It was followed by the US (1.13m), Russia (1.07m), Mexico (798,000), Brazil (792,000), Indonesia (736,000) and Pakistan (664,000).\nFor the UK, the report\u2019s estimated excess Covid deaths (163,000 to 174,000) was close to the reported figure of 173,000.\nThe five highest estimated excess mortality rates per 100,000 people were seen in Bolivia (734.9), Bulgaria (647.3), Eswatini (634.9), North Macedonia (583.6) and Lesotho (562.9).\nDifferences between official figures for Covid-related deaths and the researchers\u2019 estimates could be due to a lack of testing, challenges in reporting such deaths, or inability to access healthcare because the pandemic disrupted services, the authors say. That gap is largest in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nThey developed a statistical model to measure excess deaths in countries where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, which has enabled them to generate their figure of 18.2 million deaths. They also excluded weeks in which heatwaves occurred, so as not to skew the figures.\n\u201cA key finding from our study is that the totality of mortality impact from the pandemic is way beyond the reported Covid-19 death count,\u201d Wang said. \u201cOur analysis wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the promptly reported all-cause mortality data by week/month from so many countries. These data are critical in assessing disease burden and the state of population health in any country.\u201d\nOvercoming the \u201cpolitical barriers to accurate [death] reporting\u201d is necessary in countries where they exist in order to track true death tolls from future pandemics, the Lancet paper argues.\n\u201cHowever, many countries still do not have a functioning vital [deaths] registration system. What happened during the pandemic demonstrated the need for both civil and vital registration systems and a disease surveillance system.\u201d",

        "content": "At the end of one of the strangest days in the history of English football, Thomas Tuchel suggested it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for Chelsea as the European champions eased to a 3-1 win against Norwich just a few short hours after the club had been placed in suspended animation by government sanctions.\nIt is a mark of how profound the turbulence around Chelsea has become that Tuchel has already developed an effective public manner for dealing with questions about the club ownership. Links to the warmongering regime of Vladimir Putin? Chants from fans about sanctions? Tuchel has been left to field these issues. But he was brusque and impressively straight-batted at Carrow Road.\n\u201cThe evening did not feel strange,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps sometimes to have a fixed schedule. You use it to give you structure, to feel safe, to have lunch together, to have your meetings. It helps you to be in that mood. There is another level of distraction with the sanctions, we could feel it and the disturbance around it, but we accepted it. The excitement and love of the game helps us.\n\u201cThe team showed very good character. We can be proud that they performed like this under the circumstances. The squad and the structure and the culture in the club is right.\u201d\nAsked about the gleefully provocative chants of the away section, which gloried the name of Roman Abramovich and referenced UK sanctions related to the deaths of Ukrainian civilians, Tuchel replied: \u201cI did not hear them and did not understand them. It\u2019s the first time I heard about them and I prefer not to comment.\u201d\nChelsea were relieved in the end to escape some late Norwich pressure before scoring their third goal through the excellent Kai Havertz. But Tuchel was adamant this had nothing to do with off-field pressures.\n\u201c[The players] were relived because of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in control but then the opponent got stronger. They had nothing to lose, they took more risks and we struggled to adapt. That was the relief, not the situation, the sanctions. That will not go away.\u201d\nThe sanctions imposed on Abramovich also affect Chelsea\u2019s women\u2019s side. Speaking after their 4-1 victory over West Ham in the Women\u2019s Super League on Thursday evening, Emma Hayes described the developments earlier in the day as a \u201cbig moment\u201d for Chelsea but also called for patience from all associated with the club.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the things that are going on \u2013 we read, we watch television,\u201d the manager said. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s bigger situations. And yes, today is a big moment for the club. But I believe in giving both sides the time to get it right going forward. I think it is important for the players, the staff, the fans to be patient. Let\u2019s sort through that. And hopefully that process won\u2019t take too long.\n\u201cI said to the players, our job is to do what we\u2019ve always done and they\u2019re the only things that I can control. So, it\u2019s not difficult to focus on that because we\u2019re doing something we love. And yes, there\u2019s uncertainty. I think preoccupying our minds too much with that is only going to add to it. So, I don\u2019t [let it consume me] to be honest with you. I just try to get things right from game to game.\u201d",

Those teachers instead face a real-terms pay cut of 5% over the next two years.\nLuke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS, said: \u201cSmaller pay rises of 2%-3% per year for most other teachers are likely to represent real-terms cuts and would follow on from more than a decade of real-terms pay cuts. There is also a risk that the highly unstable geopolitical and economic situation pushes inflation higher still.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s proposals work out to a 4% pay rise if applied across the board. But the IFS said that a higher average pay award of 5% for teachers was affordable this year thanks to the rise in school funding from September.\n\u201cAn increase in school funding of close to \u00a34bn in 2022 means there is room for a higher pay award within planned school budgets. A higher award than that proposed by the government may carry fewer risks than a lower one,\u201d Sibieta said.\nZahawi will also announce that he is establishing a new arm\u2019s-length body to help teachers and schools design the curriculum and deliver lessons. The new body will repurpose the Oak National Academy, created by a group of teachers and academies to deliver online lessons during the 2020 school closures.\n\u201cInstead of each teacher reinventing the wheel, they will be able to access content, for free, that continuously evolves and gets better and better on the back of feedback from teachers across the country \u2013 saving time and improving lessons immeasurably,\u201d Zahawi will say.\nHowever, the education secretary will be accused of allowing schools and colleges to be \u201cthrown to the wolves\u201d by his decision to restart league tables based on this year\u2019s exam results.\nPepe Di\u2019Iasio, president of the Association of School and College Leaders and head teacher of a secondary school in Rotherham, will tell members: \u201cHow can it be right to compare the performance of one school or college with another when they have been so differently affected by the pandemic over the last two years?\u201d\nA survey of ASCL members found that 80% were opposed to league tables being resumed.",

Lehmann did not respond to a request for comment.\nOn Thursday the ABC managing director, David Anderson, opened the ABC\u2019s first bureau in Charleville in south-west Queensland, one of 55 new positions which have been filled in every state and in the Northern Territory.\nThe ABC has been able to expand its regional and rural coverage \u2013 bringing the number of journos outside the cities to 600 \u2013 thanks to the passage of the news media bargaining code 12 months ago.\nAfter being a late entrant to the eligible media organisations, the ABC was able to negotiate with Facebook and Google for an undisclosed sum which the broadcaster promised would be spent on regional and rural public interest journalism.\nThe Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, said the tech funds \u201cmade a huge, huge difference to our newsroom\u201d and enabled the site to double its podcasting desk and expand reportage outside the capital cities.\n News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment also signed deals with Facebook and Google but neither company has chosen to disclose what the funds have been spent on.\nThe code was described this week by the Judith Neilson Institute (JNI) inaugural Alan Moorehead journalist-in-residence, Bill Grueskin, as an Australian success story \u201cto those who\u2019ve long yearned to force big tech to prop up suffering newsrooms,\u201d who also said it was \u201ca murky deal\u201d with unprecedented secrecy.\nGrueskin, who is a professor of professional practice at Columbia University\u2019s graduate school of journalism, spoke about his research into the code at JNI\u2019s Chippendale headquarters on Thursday, and how difficult it was to glean any details from the media companies which signed the deals with the tech giants. \u201cCritical details [were] guarded like they\u2019re nuclear launch codes,\u201d Grueskin said. He said he was surprised how tight-lipped everyone was about the nature of the deals, said to be worth a total of $200m.\nGrueskin\u2019s article about the code in the Columbia Journalism Review summed it up: \u201cIn the words of one Sydney media executive, \u2018It\u2019s like a brown paper bag gets stuffed with money, is shoved across the table, and then the platforms can say: Now just shut the fuck up.\u2019\u201d\nDaily Telegraph columnist Miranda Devine, who joined the New York Post for an 18-month stint before the 2020 US election, has loved it so much she has decided to stay in the Big Apple.\nDevine has become a darling of the right in the US, making the gig work with appearances on Fox News, columns in Murdoch\u2019s Sydney and New York tabloids and a book about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, Laptop From Hell.\n\u201cIt is very exciting,\u201d Devine told CNN\u2019s Source Material. \u201cThere is never a dull minute at the New York Post,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved my time here and I look forward to lots more.\u201d\nThe editors of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Bevan Shields and Gay Alcorn, have belatedly apologised to readers for incidents last month which brought the Nine newspapers considerable criticism.\nWeekly Beast reported two weeks ago that at least one staff member told Shields before 7am that the Sydney train outage was \u201cnot technically a strike\u201d and that \u201cindustrial action\u201d would be a better description. Shields insisted it was a strike. Internal messages revealing the exchange were later leaked.\nIn a letter to subscribers on Friday Shields said it wasn\u2019t a conspiracy it was just a \u201cstuff-up\u201d: \u201cSome critics have tried to portray the use of the word \u2018strike\u2019 as some kind of conspiracy but this was simply a stuff-up, which was later corrected. Any assessment of our coverage over the following hours and days would detect no sign of anti-union bias.\u201d\nThere was no explanation why it took more than 10 days between staff raising concerns and the readers\u2019 letter to correct a basic factual mistake.\nAlcorn addressed the removal of the story by Chip Le Grand that suggested multimillionaire Geoff Bainbridge was the victim of an elaborate six-year extortion racket.\nThe Melbourne editor, who had already admitted the Age was \u201cbadly misled\u201d, told readers it was an \u201cembarrassing error\u201d and that she was sorry.\n\u201cThis was an embarrassing error, and we have inquired into how it happened and what our processes should be to prevent something like this happening again,\u201d Alcorn said.",

        "content": "Construction workers discover body during renovation of the more than century old Henry J Kaiser Convention Center\nThe mysterious discovery of a mummified body in the walls of a historic convention center in Oakland, California, has prompted an urgent search for answers, as authorities seek to untangle the person\u2019s identity and how they came to be entombed within the building\u2019s walls.\nConstruction workers discovered the body on Wednesday afternoon during renovations of Henry J Kaiser convention center, a more than century-old building near the city\u2019s downtown. Little is known about the person, who authorities said appears to be a man, or how he was preserved within the wall of the convention center, which has long been vacant. Officials estimate he had been there for between three and five years based on the state of decay.\nThe victim\u2019s body was found behind drywall and between two concrete pillars in the top tier of the auditorium in a cavity with only a 15-inch opening, according to the Oakland police department. \u201cMarkings and biological evidence at the top of the opening indicate the victim may have been deceased near the top and over time his body slowly decayed and slipped toward the bottom of the cavity space,\u201d said Lt Frederick Shavies of the Oakland police department in an official update on Thursday.\nAn investigation and identification of the victim is still ongoing but officials determined the person was an adult male based on bone structure and anatomy. The coroner will rely on dental records, and possibly preserved fingerprints, to learn who the person is, but other identifiers, including age or race, could not immediately be perceived.\nShavies said that further clarification for cause of death is pending an autopsy but authorities do not at this time believe this was a homicide. \u201cNo obvious or unnatural trauma was found indicating foul play, nor were the victims hands, feet, or other body parts bound,\u201d Shavies said, noting that the skeletal remains carried no visual signs of harm.\nThe Henry J Kaiser convention center is an Oakland-designated historical landmark that opened in 1914. The auditorium was once a renowned performance space that had hosted a range of artists and speakers, including Martin Luther King Jr, Elvis Presley and the Grateful Dead.\nIt has sat empty in recent years, after city leaders determined it was too expensive to maintain. But in 2015, Oakland\u2019s city council approved a plan to reinstate the structure as a performing arts venue and commercial space. Orton Development Ltd, the company handling the renovation, declined to comment on the discovery.\nOfficials who said initially that this was a homicide investigation reported on Thursday that it might instead have been an unfortunate mishap. \u201cBased on the positionality the victim\u2019s body was found in,\u201d said Shavies, \u201cthis tragic death is most likely an accidental death caused by positional asphyxiation due to compression from the small space.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Longtime activist who still faces the possibility of a retrial tells the Guardian she believes she\u2019s being \u2018persecuted\u2019 for being outspoken\nPamela Moses, the Memphis woman who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote, says she is grateful to be released \u2013 but believes the case against her was a \u201cscare tactic\u201d to discourage other people from casting a ballot.\nMoses was released from prison on bond on 25 February after a judge unexpectedly granted her request for a new trial, citing evidence, obtained by the Guardian, that had not been disclosed to Moses\u2019 defense.\nIn her first interview since being freed Moses recalled the moment in the courtroom when Judge W Mark Ward decided to grant her a new trial \u2013 and said she was \u201coverwhelmed with joy\u201d. Video shows Moses nearly in tears and screaming in excitement when Ward ruled he was granting her a new trial.\nShe knew that judges rarely reverse themselves and grant requests for new trials, but she had been praying Ward would see beyond her criminal record. \u201cI was very grateful that God had allowed him to correct his own mistake, and that\u2019s what you need in the criminal justice system.\u201d\nBut Moses, a longtime activist connected to the Memphis chapter of Black Lives Matter, still faces the possibility of a retrial. Moses says she was unaware she was ineligible to vote, and state officials acknowledged they made an error in indicating to her that she was eligible. Her case has brought renewed focus to the practice, common in many US states, of depriving people convicted of certain felonies of their voting rights for widely varying lengths of time, but sometimes for life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scare tactic, what they did to me,\u201d Moses told the Guardian. She thinks other people with criminal convictions will think twice before seeking to cast a ballot in elections. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018if she went to jail for that, we don\u2019t need to do that. We don\u2019t need to follow her because we\u2019re going to be in jail for six years too.\u2019 I would say it sends a confusing message to people who want to vote.\n\u201cWhy should people be worried if they\u2019re going to be prosecuted for doing their civic duty?\u201d\nMoses is a well-known activist in Memphis who has filed numerous cases in local and federal courts, often representing herself. She has been outspoken against a number of local officials, including the local election commission, judges and Amy Weirich, the local district attorney who is prosecuting her case. She said she believes she\u2019s being \u201cpersecuted\u201d for being so outspoken.\n\u201cIf you silence the loudest person that\u2019s screaming, \u2018hey Black people, go vote, don\u2019t vote for her, remove her from office\u2019 then you eliminate the opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe, not only if I wasn\u2019t Black, but if my name wasn\u2019t Pamela Moses, this probably never would have been a case.\u201d\nMoses\u2019 case attracted national attention because of the harshness of her sentence, which seemed at odds with the evidence in the case. Before the trial, election officials in Memphis conceded that they erroneously never removed her from the voter rolls after she pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2015.\nIn 2019, Moses launched a campaign for mayor of Memphis and sought clarification from court officials about whether she had completed her felony probation and could appear on the ballot. A judge told her she was still on probation, but Moses still believed she was eligible and went to a probation office and asked them to verify her eligibility and sign a certificate saying she could vote. After about an hour of investigating, the probation officer did so.\nProsecutors blamed Moses for this. In their request for an indictment, they wrote she \u201cconvinced\u201d the officer to sign off on the document. And during her sentencing hearing, Ward, the judge overseeing her case, accused her of deceiving the probation officer into signing off on the eligibility certificate. Moses said she didn\u2019t trick anyone and was stunned to hear such an assertion.\n\u201cI was like wow, I need to go to magic school or something. I\u2019m the new Houdini. I\u2019ve got that much power to trick somebody I\u2019ve never met, never seen in my life into doing something just by walking in the place? You know, no.\u201d\nBut a document obtained by the Guardian last month, after the trial concluded, showed that probation officials investigated the incident and found that the probation officer, identified as Manager Billington, had made an error on his own. Even though Moses\u2019 file said she was still on probation, Billington thought that another person had made a mistake. The official who conducted the investigation ultimately determined that Billington was negligent and to blame for the error.\nMoses went out of her way to defend Billington. \u201cI don\u2019t like how everybody is portraying that supervisor as a bad person. That man did his job,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that man did anything other than what he could do based on the information that he had in front of him.\u201d\nBut Moses was critical of Weirich, the prosecutor, who has said Moses bears some of the responsibility for her sentence because she declined to accept a plea deal that would not have resulted in additional prison time. \u201cI gave her a chance to plead to a misdemeanor with no prison time,\u201d Weirich said in February. \u201cShe requested a jury trial instead. She set this unfortunate result in motion and a jury of her peers heard the evidence and convicted her.\u201d\nMoses pushed back on that characterization. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything in my mind wrong so why would I plead to anything?\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe have a right to that. But you want me to give it up because you want it to be right? It was about the principle to me. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\nWeirich\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment. Weirich has yet to say whether she will pursue a new trial. Moses and her new legal team plan to hold a press conference in Memphis on Friday asking her to drop all of the charges.\nHer prosecution may already be having a local policy impact. Citing her case, a coalition of civil rights groups is pushing the county commission to conduct a \u201cracial equity audit\u201d to examine whether there is racial discrimination in Weirich\u2019s office.\nThe Moses case is one of several high-profile instances that underscores the disparity between how white and Black defendants can be treated when it comes to election crimes. Several white defendants across the country received minimal punishments, such as probation, for purposefully impersonating family members in order to cast multiple votes \u2013 yet Black people who made mere mistakes when attempting to follow complicated processes and procedures received prison sentences.\n\u201cThe reason why Ms Moses\u2019 situation has got the attention of the nation is because this sort of disparate treatment happens all the time,\u201d said Rodney Diggs, one of her attorneys. \u201cThe disparate treatment between people of color and non-people of color. You can just see the differences.\u201d\nMoses had been in jail since December, when the judge overseeing her case abruptly revoked her bond. She said that she contracted Covid-19. She was unaware of the attention her case was getting, except for periodic dispatches from a jail nurse who would mention that she had seen her on the local news.\nHer incarceration had been particularly hard on Tyler, her 24-year-old son, who she said lost his job and took on tasks like handling her mail and bills.\nSince she\u2019s been released, she said she has spent time with her 13-year-old son Taj \u2013 a \u201cmini me\u201d. The weekend after she was released, they went to a funeral for a relative who had been killed. She has been taking him to school and they watch Netflix together. She hasn\u2019t had to explain her case to him because he\u2019d researched it on the internet. \u201cHe asked me certain things. And I just divert,\u201d she said.\nStill, Moses said she still has a lot of anxiety. On Wednesday, she was at 40% back to normal. On Thursday, she said she was up to 65%.\n\u201cI\u2019m anxious. I\u2019m worried because these charges haven\u2019t gone away,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean look at how much money they spent on this. Just think about it. They probably could have built a school with all the money they spent prosecuting me over a piece of paper.\u201d",

Hungry walkers are rewarded with the catch of the day at a cosy old inn\nStart The Hope & Anchor, Hope CoveDistance 5.2 milesTime 2 hoursTotal ascent 237 metresDifficulty Moderate\nThis article includes content provided by Google. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nThe closer I get to Hope Cove, winding down through roads that become ever narrower, the more I understand why this village was once a smuggling hotspot. It lies on a remote edge of South Hams, between Salcombe and Bigbury-on-Sea, so getting here takes effort, and by the time the authorities had arrived, all the silks, tobacco and other booty would have been stashed away.\nNestled in the outstretched arms of Bigbury Bay, the tranquil cove is well hidden from prying eyes out at sea as well as on land. Yet a few hours due south of here by boat is the French town of Roscoff, which became a major smuggling port after the British government clamped down on illicit shipments from the Channel Islands in the 18th century. At the height of the smuggling boom, luggers from Roscoff would drop consignments of brandy in the shallow waters of this bay and fishermen from Hope Cove would later bring them ashore in an operation that saw most of the villagers playing cat and mouse with customs officials.\nHope Cove is actually made up of two villages, Outer and Inner Hope. I park by the Hope & Anchor pub in Outer Hope and begin my walk on the narrow street that forms part of the South West Coast Path. I\u2019m heading south towards Inner Hope, between the cottages in which smuggled goods were once hidden until they could be sold on. Aside from a few dog walkers and a bellyboarding couple in wetsuits, I see few other people as I set off. The bellyboarders\u2019 occasional shrieks as they catch small, cold waves follow me as I leave.\nOut of season, this corner of South Hams is wonderfully quiet, though it was not always so peaceful. In November 1840, the London Times reported that villagers from Hope Cove had attacked a coastguard crew who\u2019d seized their contraband, almost drowning the commanding officer. In another clash, the women of the village were caught preparing donkeys for smuggling, arrested en masse and jailed at Exeter for insulting the coastguard officers. According to one (possibly embellished) account, on being released they managed to filch the kettle from the jail.\nA local resident tells me that some of the old smuggling tunnels that ran up from the beach to the cellars of the houses are still there.\nBy the lifeboat slipway, a track leads up steps into woods and emerges on to the headland at Bolt Tail. Where Hope Cove is enclosed and protected, Bolt Tail is high up and exposed. The coast path leads slightly inland here, but the headland is crisscrossed with desire lines, and I wander the interweaving paths above the cliffs, making my way out to the tip of the headland, for views back across the bay on one side and a stunning seascape on the other, before joining the main route again.\nThe sea is perfectly calm when I visit. But the 30 shipwrecks on the bay\u2019s seabed tell a different story (as do the anchor and cannon that sit by the road in Port Hope, having been lifted from the Erme estuary farther along the coast). Here, the gentle can become rough in an instant. While the bay was, and still is, used as a safe anchorage in a storm, ships heading here would often find themselves in trouble in a southerly blow, realising too late that they could not steer out of the bay and being driven on to the rocks below Bolt Tail.\nWhile smuggling and tall ships are firmly in Hope Cove\u2019s past, fishing is still part of its present. From the headland I watch fishers pulling lobster pots in the bay as I try to make out the cliffs of Cornwall\u2019s Rame Head in the far distance. The smugglers along this stretch of coast benefited from its proximity to Cornwall \u2013 we\u2019re only 12 miles from Plymouth Sound here, and locals knew that customs officials on one side of the county border would not pursue smugglers across it.\nBeyond Bolt Tail, the track becomes a gravel path, and at the carpark at Bolberry Down I join the road again below a phone mast. I\u2019m always reluctant to turn inland when I\u2019ve been looking out to sea, but the soft greens of Devon countryside, with views into the heart of South Hams, provide yet another contrast; and a few hundred metres further on, the holloway named Sweetheart\u2019s Lane is filled with birdsong and feels as though it belongs to another time and place entirely.\nLooping back through several fields, with the village of Galmpton visible to the right, I catch sight of the sea again, and the rooftops of Hope Cove. I follow the path down the side of the pretty church of Saint Clements, which leads back out onto the cove.\nBack at the beach the shrieking bellyboarders, like the smugglers, are long gone, and though I do not find any of the smugglers\u2019 tunnels from the beach, the cove\u2019s rockpools are well worth investigating at low tide.\nThe 18th-century Hope & Anchor is all welcoming woodburners and cosiness. In the dining room, it turns out I am the only first-time visitor and conversation turns gently competitive as to who has the longest-standing relationship with the pub. The couple at the table next to me have been coming here for 40 years and those opposite for 30. I can see why.\nIt\u2019s the sort of place that inspires return visits and conversations with strangers. Refurbished in May 2020, it strikes a balance between understated style and Devon charm. The food ranges from an excellent catch of the day to tagines and vegan \u201cfish\u201d and chips, much of which is offered in smaller portions for lunch.\nThe rooms (some dog-friendly) have the same sense of relaxed, cosy comfort as the rest of the pub. Mine looks out to sea over the thatched roof of Beachcomber Cottage, which sleeps eight and is also let by the pub. Though it is winter, I open the windows to better let in the sound of the breaking waves, and keep half an ear open for any approaching luggers from Roscoff \u2026Doubles from \u00a3110 B&B, hopeandanchor.co.uk\nThe Draw of The Sea, by Wyl Menmuir, will be published in July\n This article was amended on 24 March 2022 to add information about the undersea location of the gun now on display at Port Hope, but found some distance away.

        "content": "Ukrainian websites have been subjected to a relentless series of attacks \u2013 but what will happen when the sights are set on America?\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has been widely anticipated to play out online, in addition to on the ground.\nMoscow\u2019s cyberwar capabilities have long been cause for concern. Russia has a record of coordinating cyber-attacks on the US, Ukraine and other adversaries. And the country has established itself in recent years as an international hub for cybercrime.\nRussia\u2019s past has raised fears of a large scale cyberwar effort targeting Ukraine and its allies, including the US. While the Biden administration has reportedly played out potential responses to cyber warfare, some experts have argued that the US is not well prepared for a significant cyber-attack.\nWe spoke with Glenn S Gerstell, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the former general counsel of the National Security Agency, about the likelihood of serious cyber warfare \u2013 and whether the US is prepared to respond.\n\u201cIf we had approached this correctly 20 years ago, we would be largely invulnerable to cyber-attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unfortunately that is not the case.\u201d\nWhat kinds of attacks have we seen thus far in the conflict, and what are we still on the lookout for?\nWe\u2019re seeing a relentless series of attacks against Ukrainian websites, especially those that are government-linked and government-controlled. That\u2019s part of a pattern we have seen for the past eight years in which Russia has regarded Ukraine as its sort of cyber punching bag.\nWhat we have not yet seen are completely destructive attacks on the infrastructure in Ukraine, such as the ones we saw in 2015 and 2016 when Russia seemingly shut down the electric grid.\nWhy is a Russian cyber-attack against Ukraine or its allies so widely anticipated?\nRussia has used its very formidable cyber skills against the US and other countries in the past \u2013 we have seen what it can do in the form of SolarWinds, the Colonial Pipeline hack and scores of ransomware attacks in every industry in the United States.\nSo we know they are a sophisticated cyber adversary, we know they have a motive to do so \u2013 they\u2019d like to throw sand in our gears to disrupt things here and achieve a strategic advantage in the conflict.\nBut whether Vladimir Putin would take the risk of actively engaging in destructive cyber warfare is another matter.\nWhat would happen if Russia were to attack the US and how likely is such an attack?\nI do not see Russia turning off the lights in the United States, for a number of reasons: many people in the US have taken the position that a cyber-attack with real-world destructive effects is the same as a missile attack or bomb, and therefore would be viewed as an act of war.\nIn that case, there is no upside for Putin, because he knows it would trigger a very unclear set of escalations and retaliations. It\u2019s not going to achieve a strategic objective, and may end up very badly, making Russia net worse off.\nDoes the US have a set response to a cyber act of war, like it would for a physical act of war?\nThe US could respond in a number of ways: with a stealth cyber-attack on Russian agencies or a more visible cyber-attack the US openly admits to carrying out.\nWe could also carry out a military action, in response to a cyber-attack and do something physical. There is, of course also a range of economic sanctions the US could take against Russia, it could remove diplomats \u2013 the response is quite fluid.\nHow prepared is the US to respond to a cyber-attack from Russia?\nWe\u2019re prepared to respond in the sense that our military has an extraordinary offensive capability to respond on a cyber level \u2013 but we are not ready to defend as a country.\nThe private sector is not prepared for attacks. It has relied on buggy software to protect itself, and cyberthreats are growing faster than our ability to adapt to them. We need to impose some kind of mandatory solution, because the pure market solution isn\u2019t viable.\nThe US has been reactive and side-stepped cyber responsibility by simply grafting it on to existing government agencies, making each agency responsible for its own area.\nEverything from hospitals to bridges to roads and tunnels are relevant to national security, so we need government action to address it with a centralized solution \u2013 our national wellbeing depends on it.\nCould you explain a bit further how non-governmental entities are vulnerable to hacks, and what effects that could have?\nThe Biden administration is doing its best to shore up the private sector\u2019s cyberdefenses, but it\u2019s vulnerable \u2013 from banks to hospitals, from giant public companies to smaller privately owned ones.\nWhether Putin would take the risk of a seriously destructive attack on hospitals or water systems or chemical plants is the big question. Logic would tell you that it\u2019s not worth the risk of our retaliation and has little upside for him. But if he\u2019s cornered or feels he doesn\u2019t have much more to lose, who knows?\nWhere does the international community stand on cyber-attacks?\nWhen a bomb lands on a sovereign territory, it causes real-world injuries and damage, and we typically know exactly where it launched from and how to respond.\nBut with cyber-attacks, this is not the case. The internet is not constrained by sovereign boundaries. Sometimes hacks are destructive while other times an adversary simply enters a network and violates privacy, stealing secrets and data without causing physical harm.\nThere is, however, a rough consensus that if a cyber act produces a real world harm such as injuring people or causing physical damage, it would be treated as an equivalent to a physical attack by a bomb or missile. This is to say it could be viewed it could be viewed as an act of war and trigger under international law the right to retaliate physically.\nWhy haven\u2019t we seen such a giant destructive hack yet, and could that change?\nWe surely cannot rule it out, but I think we have not experienced it yet for a number of reasons: partly because Ukrainians have been more successful when defending and securing their network, or that Russia has made a strategic decision not to destroy the economy of a country that they hoped to soon occupy.\nIn terms of attacks on the US, Putin knows if he were to authorize a destructive hack he would be met with a very strong response. It raises the stakes of our military retaliation, which is not good for him. He is likely making a strategic calculation that nobody can really understand unless you are in Putin\u2019s mind.\nHowever, it is entirely possible that if we get to a situation where Putin is cornered or feels that he\u2019s going to not succeed, he might act irrationally.\nThe calculus may change as Russia reasons that they are already bombing civilians, they are already are infuriating the international community. Why not turn off the electric grid? We cannot rule that out.",

The best thing we can do is defend the world from the violence of fossil fuel combustion. This is the defining moment of the Biden presidency and of the climate emergency itself.\u201d\nBiden has said that the fallout from the Ukraine war \u201cshould motivate to us accelerate to a transition of clean energy\u201d. But he has also jarringly boasted that more oil is now being pumped in the US than during Donald Trump\u2019s tenure, in order to counter accusations that not enough is being done to tamp down the spiraling cost of gasoline for drivers.\nThe conflict has underscored the volatile grip fossil fuels continue to have over geopolitics and people\u2019s everyday lives, causing a reckoning for Europe, which relies upon Russia for 40% of its gas supply, and dealing painful gasoline price increases to low-income people in car-dependent America.\nThe burning of fossil fuels also directly kills nearly 9 million people around the world each year from toxic air pollution and is the primary driver of global heating that scientists warn will acutely harm half of the planet\u2019s population. The International Energy Agency has warned no new fossil fuel projects can commence if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change.\n\u201cWe live in a world where a product we rely on to function is subject to the actions of dictators and a cartel,\u201d said Robbie Orvis, senior director of energy policy at Energy Innovation. \u201cWe have to decide if we want to continue that way.\u201d\nFreeing the US from its ravenous appetite for oil, gas and coal will be a sizable task. Nearly 80% of US energy consumption comes from fossil fuels, with the country burning through around 20m barrels of petroleum, about a fifth of the global total, every day. The US is the world\u2019s leading crude oil producer and imports a large volume of oil \u2013 usually heavier, thicker product than it can pump at home \u2013 from other countries. Four million barrels of oil flow each day from Canada alone.\nWeaning the US from this diet of hydrocarbons will require the passage of half a trillion dollars in clean energy tax credits proposed in the Build Back Better bill, according to analysts, which would bring the US within striking distance of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade.\n\u201cThe clean energy tax credits and other provisions would really catalyze the industry and achieve significant reductions,\u201d said Orvis, who has calculated that the support for wind, solar and electric cars would slash US oil demand, make 70% of the electricity grid run on clean energy and ensure that about half of vehicle sales are electric by 2030. Wind and solar grew at the fastest rate in US history last year.\nThe ailing coal industry could be phased out \u201cfairly easily\u201d within a decade, according to Orvis, although further federal, state and city standards and incentives are required to cut pollution from buildings, manufacturing and the remaining car fleet, promote energy efficiency and to install heat pumps in place of gas-fired furnaces.\n\u201cThe sooner we start that transition will determine how fast we can go,\u201d Orvis said. \u201cEvery day we don\u2019t start the transition we are subject to the price swings from fossil fuels that we are clearly subject to now.\u201d\nThe oil and gas industry, and its allies in Congress, has a different framing of the concept of \u201cenergy independence\u201d, accusing Biden of stymying a vast increase in drilling on public land even as it sits on millions of acres of unused permits in order to reap the benefits of an oil price that has hit near record highs.\n\u201cThe first, immediate action item is to increase our domestic oil and gas production on both federal and non-federal lands,\u201d said Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat and Senate energy committee chairman who has accused Vladimir Putin of using energy as a \u201cweapon\u201d against the US and whose opposition has so far blocked the passage of Build Back Better.\nExperts say an increase in domestic drilling would take months, or even years, to influence gasoline prices that are determined by the vagaries of a global oil market. \u201cThe idea of energy independence is sort of ridiculous \u2013 oil is a global commodity and we export a lot of oil and gas ourselves,\u201d said Michael Webber, an expert in energy resources at the University of Texas.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is one more chapter of fossil fuels\u2019 impact on world politics,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Ukraine is partly a resource war. It\u2019s not like we will have zero problems with renewables \u2013 you still need minerals for renewable energy infrastructure. But we\u2019d have far less than we have now.\u201d",

        "content": "Cousin weeps outside court as she speaks of \u2018joyful and generous\u2019 young man whose death shattered Yuendumu community\nThe families of Kumanjayi Walker have had to hold back their feelings from public view for more than two years. So when they were finally able to speak, on the steps of the Northern Territory supreme court on Friday, their grief and disappointment overwhelmed the carefully worded statements they had prepared.\nA jury acquitted police officer Zachary Rolfe of murder on Friday over the 2019 shooting of Walker in Yuendumu. The court heard Walker was shot three times, with Rolfe arguing he acted to protect his and his partner\u2019s safety.\nNed Jampinjinpa Hargreaves, a Warlpiri elder, was in tears when he spoke outside court after the verdict.\n\u201cWhen are we going to get justice?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhen?\u201d\nHargreaves called for an end to guns in rural communities.\n\u201cKarrinjarla muwajarri. No guns! No guns in the rural remote community! Enough is enough! It\u2019s gotta stop.\n\u201cTo our people \u2013 let us stand strong. Let us respect each other. And we do not want to see another black young fella, or a girl, to be shot.\u201d\nWarren Williams then spoke, reminding the media and onlookers outside the court in Darwin that they were all on Aboriginal land, and that there was a need to show respect for that fact. \u201cWe are the custodians of this land, of this community called Australia. We need to be recognised as true owners of this land. We need to have control of our lives. We have our own yapa system in our culture, in our law.\u201d\nWalker\u2019s families have worked hard to keep a lid on any commentary over the past two years, regularly reminding followers and supporters not to say anything on social media that could interfere with a fair trial. Their young leaders have worked as media managers, providing clarity and assistance, speaking with dignity and respecting the wishes of their elders. They showed an incredible capacity to stay calm and focused.\nThe last and youngest of the family to speak, Samara Fernandez Brown, wept as she spoke of five exhausting weeks at the trial. She wanted to remind everyone of Walker\u2019s humanity. She said he was a \u201cjoyful and generous\u201d young man who \u201cloved animals, loved his family, who loved his partner, his friends, his homelands, who loved music\u201d.\n\u201cA young man who was taken far too soon, and a young man who will be deeply, deeply missed,\u201d Fernandez Brown said.\n\u201cKumanjayi was only 19 years old when he died at the police station of Yuendumu after being shot three times by Zachary Rolfe. That is a fact. That cannot be disputed.\u201d\n\u201cHe died without his family\u2019s support, even though we stood just outside, begging to come in to see if he was OK. He was rejected the opportunity to be comforted in his last moments, and we were robbed of the opportunity to say goodbye to him.\n\u201cSometimes I think about how he must have felt in his last moments. Was he scared? Terrified, I\u2019d imagine. Was he in pain? Excruciating pain, I would think. And he was alone. His death has affected our community and our family in ways that we can\u2019t describe. We are all in so much pain.\u201d\nFor the families of Walker and for Warlpiri people of Yuendumu, this case has brought back memories of the past. This was the first time a police officer was brought to trial for a shooting at Yuendumu, but they remember all the times when police acted with impunity along the colonial frontier.\nThe most recent mass killing of Warlpiri people happened at Coniston in 1928, when a police constable, George Murray, led a group of men on horseback who shot and killed more than 50 men, women and children at at least six sites. Warlpiri, Anmatyerre and Kaytetye people say up to 170 died.\nWhen Warlpiri elders talk about wanting \u201cno more guns\u201d, they are referring to that history.\nFernandez Brown said there will now be a period of grieving for a life lost and for a reach towards justice, which for them has fallen far too short.\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed and, though we\u2019ve been given a trial, I can\u2019t, with honesty, say that it\u2019s been fair ... We will return home and continue our healing process, but this is not the last you will hear from Kumanjayi Walker\u2019s family,\u201d Fernandez Brown said.\nThe next step will be a coronial inquest, which will examine the details of what happened after the shooting, when police took Walker into the station and the families waited outside for hours for news of his condition.\n\u201cThis is not the end of his story. This is not the end of our fight, after some rest we will turn our attention to the coronial inquest where we hope our truth and our questions will finally come. To ensure no other family will go through what we have endured over the past two years,\u201d Fernandez Brown said.",

        "content": "The 250-player international tournament in Iceland will be staged with zero Covid restrictions, and provides a breakthrough chance for young English talents \nHalf a century on from 1972, the Bobby Fischer v Boris Spassky series in Reykjavik remains the most famous of all world championship matches. It triggered a global chess boom, not least in Britain where for a brief period a galaxy of talent made England the No 2 chess nation behind the Soviet Union.\nReykjavik has another tradition, its annual international open first staged in 1964 when the legendary Mikhail Tal outclassed the field with 12.5/13. The 2022 edition at the Harpa Conference Centre from 6-12 April has a tight schedule of nine rounds in seven days, zero Covid restrictions, and morning excursions which include a visit to Fischer\u2019s grave.\nThere are no Russians or Ukrainians, few Americans, and the four top seeds are all from India. England has one of the largest contingents, 31, most of whom are amateurs rated below 2000.\nGM Simon Williams is the leading English player, and Reykjavik will also test England\u2019s most promising juniors. Jonah Willow, 19, of Nottingham, and Harry Grieve, 20, of Guildford, already have international master norms and are closing in on the title, while Shreyas Royal, 13, missed his first norm by just half a point at Ilkley last week.\nGrieve also represents Cambridge in the annual varsity match, first staged in 1873 and the longest running annual fixture in world chess. This Saturday\u2019s renewal at its traditional venue, the RAC in Pall Mall, London, will be online at chess24.com (12.30pm start).\nGMs Michael Adams, Luke McShane and Gawain Jones were on top board for their German clubs when the 2022 Bundesliga season opened last week. All six games were halved, with the pick being McShane\u2019s eventful draw with the new German star Vincent Keymer, 17.\nKeymer looked superior with his mobile central pawns until McShane, after half an hour\u2019s thought, found the tactic 17 Bf4! This could have given the English GM the full point with 20 Nf5! regaining the sacrificed piece with advantage, but instead he settled for perpetual check.\nEngland\u2019s other active top grandmaster, David Howell, is currently playing a \u00a315,000 10-game classical match in London against Sweden\u2019s No 1, Nils Grandelius. Games are viewable live online (2pm start). Howell took a 4.5-3.5 lead on Thursday with the best game of the match.\nThe first major weekend congress of 2022 takes place at the Imperial Hotel, Blackpool, from Friday until Sunday, with 350-400 entries expected, five sections, and \u00a36,700 in prizes including \u00a3700 for the Lancashire Open winner. Due to the pandemic and/or venue problems, many popular congresses were cancelled in 2021, so players are eager for action.\nAn exception seems to be experts and near-masters. Blackpool\u2019s top seed is 2520-rated Danny Gormally, the England No 12, but only four others are rated above 2300. This is a distinct weakening compared with many previous years, when Michael Adams, Matthew Sadler, and Stuart Conquest were listed among the winners.\nBlackpool\u2019s experience seems to reflect a general downsizing of weekend events, which in turn relates to the boom in online play, One-day rapidplays rather than two-day weekenders are becoming the norm, opens rarely have a prize structure to attract masters, let alone GMs, while the ECF seems to have quietly abandoned its long established congress Grand Prix for the best overall performances in a season. In the 1970s, the heyday of English weekend congresses, the Grand Prix had a \u00a31,000 first prize and even had an opening named after it \u2013 the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian 1 e4 c5 with Nc3, Bc4, f4, Nf3, 0-0, Qe1-h4, f5 and an easy to play assault against the black king.\nRichard Rapport defeated Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 1.5-0.5 in the Belgrade semi-final of the Fide Grand Prix, as the Hungarian sprung the rare move 12 Rc3! which provoked errors by the Frenchman in his favourite Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence. In the other semi-final Dmitry Andreikin (Russia) beat Anish Giri (Netherlands) 2.5-1.5 after the Dutchman spoilt two winning positions. Andreikin meets Rapport in the final on Saturday (2pm start).\nThe groups for the third and final Grand Prix leg in Berlin have been announced, and include an unpleasant surprise for Hikaru Nakamura and Levon Aronian, who dominated the first leg in February. The two Americans are both in Group A along with Andreikin, whereas none of the other three groups has more than one potential qualifier. As it stands, Nakamura and Aronian cannot both qualify.\n3806 1 Qxd5! exd5 2 Nf6+! gxf6 3 exf6+ Be7 4 Rxe7+ Kf8 5 Re8+!

        "content": "The Latvian is on the verge of returning to the Top 10 after a fine run of form, but her love for front-foot tennis remains intact\nEven in an era of professional tennis filled with athletes who can obliterate any ball off their groundstrokes from any part of the court, Jelena Ostapenko is unique. Her strength doesn\u2019t simply lie in her power but the natural timing that allows her to change the direction of any speeding ball, the precision of her early, flat shots and, most importantly, her unrelenting belief that she must be in control of every point of every match. When in full flow and absurdly aiming for every line, she will find them.\nThe clearest example of Ostapenko\u2019s talents came in the biggest, most tense moment of her career, when aged 20 she marched into the 2017 French Open final before trailing Simona Halep 0-3 and facing three separate break points in the third set. With her back to the wall, Ostapenko swung and swung until she changed her own destiny, reeling off the final six games to win her first grand slam title.\nHaving punched herself into a new existence as a grand slam champion with a target on her back and a high-risk style that is so hard to consistently maintain, a dip in Ostapenko\u2019s form after her win was widely anticipated. While it did not come immediately, by 2019 Ostapenko had fallen as low as No 83 in the world. Some small positive runs followed, and occasionally enough shots landed in for a big win, but all too often Ostapenko would step into matches determined to hit her opponent off the court and self-sabotage with unforced errors in the process.\nAs the great BNP Paribas Open begins in Indian Wells this week, however, Ostapenko arrives as one of the stories of the season. After being ranked outside the top 50 last year, she is now No 12, on the verge of returning to the top 10 and rising quickly. Since September she has pieced together one of the most consistent periods of her career, performing week after week and compiling a 23-8 record.\nWhile her gradual rise up the rankings initially flew somewhat under the radar, last month she burst back into the spotlight by embarking on a nine-match winning streak in the Middle East, winning the Dubai WTA 500 event before reaching the semi-final at the WTA 1000 in Doha. Across her nine wins, Ostapenko defeated six different grand slam champions: Sofia Kenin, Iga Swiatek, Petra Kvitova, Simona Halep, Barbora Krejcikova and Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza.\nFor most big-hitting tennis players in a long slump, the route to sustained success is always said to be by playing more consistent, cerebral tennis, such as adding more top spin and tempering the urge to attack every shot. Ostapenko has certainly attempted to broaden her skill set at times, incorporating more drop shots and patience while echoing those sentiments in interviews.\nYet as she discussed her revival in the Middle East last month, she had other ideas, instead doubling down on her need to lace every point with attacking play. \u201cI was trying to be more accurate and just put the ball in play, which I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she told WTA insider. \u201cI should go for my shots and play my aggressive game. I felt like I have to be even more aggressive sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cAggressive\u201d is the most overused word in the sport, a sentiment that even some of the most defensive players on both tours use to describe their tactics, but Ostapenko\u2019s commitment to attacking tennis runs deep. She believes that tennis should be played on the front foot, taking risks and controlling your own destiny, and she has frequently shown no respect for players who rather live off their consistency and their opponents\u2019 errors.\nWhen she was younger, Ostapenko\u2019s abhorrence of defensive opponents even extended to the best players in the world. When the 19-year-old Ostapenko played against the then No 4, Agnieszka Radwanska, in 2016, she spent her changeovers during the loss denigrating her opponent\u2019s game to her coach and vowed never to play her again. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t play at all,\u201d said Ostapenko. \u201cShe plays like an amateur. Our amateurs play better in Latvia.\u201d\nWhile Ostapenko refuses to temper her playing style, her revival has not merely been a consequence of hitting a purple patch. There have been only a few matches where her winners flowed freely, particularly when she dismantled Muguruza and Krejcikova in consecutive matches in Doha. Otherwise, she has dug out wins from dire positions, sometimes while playing far from her best tennis. In Dubai she played three brutal three-set matches in succession, against Swiatek, Kvitova and Halep, recovering from a set down in all and saving a match point against Kvitova.\nShe showed that even with her low-percentage game, she can still give herself the best chance of success by controlling what she can control, remaining mentally present in every point, match and tournament, and not allowing her emotions to cloud her play. In the process she has found a rare period of consistency: since September she has lost only to current or former top 10 players in completed matches.\nThis steadfast consistency will not hold forever; there will be plenty of volatility in Ostapenko\u2019s results as long as she maintains her commitment to attacking at all costs, but she has put herself in the position to be a contender once moreand the top levels of her sport are enriched with her presence.",

        "content": "All eyes on Stamford Bridge, Palace try to repeat City heroics and Brentford want more of the same from Eriksen\nBrighton\u2019s four defeats on the spin appeared to come from nowhere and, in the space of three weeks, doubled their number of losses for the season. They will not be relegated but a European spot is surely now out of the question, with no guarantees things will turn dramatically when Liverpool visit. \u201cEvery team will have a tough period and we\u2019re going through ours now,\u201d said the midfielder Steven Alzate, one of few Seagulls players to come out with much credit from the defeat at Newcastle. Brighton do tend to give Liverpool a game, on the positive side. They drew this fixture last season and their comeback from two down to earn a point at Anfield may yet come to be an episode J\u00fcrgen Klopp regrets bitterly when he looks back at the title race. Before what looks to be a defining four weeks for Klopp\u2019s hopes, with Liverpool due to visit Arsenal and Manchester City, Alzate and company will hope to put another huge spanner in the works. NA\nBrighton v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)\nThe equation is fairly simple for Manchester United and Tottenham. This is a game neither can really afford to lose as they pursue Arsenal for a top-four spot. In the hosts\u2019 case, losing further ground when the Gunners will have four games in hand on Saturday night would be particularly costly. A win would at least put them fourth and give rivals something to topple. It will be intriguing to see how these two sides respond, respectively, to a crushing derby defeat and a thumping win over a dejected Everton. Spurs\u2019 lack of consistency is chronic but a fourth league win in five would alleviate some of Antonio Conte\u2019s concerns and show their sensational victory last time they were in Manchester was no fluke. For United, all bets are off, whether or not Cristiano Ronaldo is able to return from his hip flexor problem. It would not be shocking to see either side win by two or three. Given their new-found position of supremacy, Arsenal can have fun sitting back and seeing who comes off worse. NA\nManchester United v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm\nEven if she had hacked into the Premier League\u2019s fixture computer, a Russian cyber felon could hardly have arranged a more striking match-up for Chelsea. After a week in which the west London club have had a financial clamp put on them because of their owner\u2019s undesirable connections, Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side are to host none other than Newcastle United, a de facto public relations vehicle for a Saudi regime accused of committing war crimes in Yemen, among other atrocities. Sunday\u2019s match at Stamford Bridge will be brought to you in association with Hypocrisy. PD\nChelsea v Newcastle, Sunday 12.30pm\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2022/03/10-54431-gnl.fw.20220310.jg.psgchampionsleaguecollapseagain.mp3\nNot for the first time since their takeover, Wolves got themselves into a brilliant position from which to attack a top-four spot, then flopped. Last time it happened, in 2019-20, it was easy to blame Nuno Espir\u00edto Santo, whose tepid approach did a colossal disservice to a talented group who were capable of much better. Bruno Lage generally sends his team out to play positively and yet, the moment the Champions League was in sight, things again went wrong. Wolves were knocked out of the FA Cup by Norwich and then beaten at home by Arsenal. After rallying with two wins, Lage\u2019s side then lost three in a row, their late collapse in the Arsenal return particularly embarrassing. Victory over Watford, though, means they travel to Merseyside in good heart, to meet another relegation-threatened side. There\u2019s a good chance this will be the nerviest, scrappiest match of the weekend \u2013 and all the more enjoyable for it. DH\nEverton v Wolves, Sunday 2pm\nThe good news keeps on coming for Arsenal. Jamie Vardy has scored 11 times against them in 14 appearances and, in Leicester\u2019s last two visits to the Emirates, came up with game-altering goals in the dying minutes. Aaron Ramsdale, who was not on the receiving end of those contributions but has faced Vardy with Bournemouth and Sheffield United, says the striker is \u201cthe one I hate playing against most\u201d. On Sunday Ramsdale and his teammates will be spared. Vardy has a knee problem and will miss the next month or so, meaning Arsenal are at no risk of a repeat performance from their nemesis. Not so long ago, Leicester were widely seen as the shining example for a flailing Arsenal. The league table does not make that case anymore and a fifth straight win looks well within Mikel Arteta\u2019s grasp, especially as the Foxes faced Rennes on Thursday night. Vardy\u2019s absence will do the hosts no harm. NA\nArsenal v Leicester, Sunday 4.30pm\nDean Smith described last weekend\u2019s match against Brentford as a \u201cmust-not-lose\u201d. Unfortunately, Norwich lost it. Saturday brings another six-pointer against Leeds, dragged into the relegation mire following the desperate run that brought an end to Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s tenure. There is still hope for Norwich, because Everton may also be in free-fall. It was Norwich\u2019s 2-1 win at Carrow Road in January that prompted the dismissal of Rafael Ben\u00edtez and the subsequent arrival of Frank Lampard. If Norwich can muster maximum points against another relegation rival it probably won\u2019t prompt another managerial change \u2013 it will only be Jesse Marsch\u2019s third match in charge \u2013 but the battle to avoid the drop could look tighter than ever. LM\nLeeds United v Norwich, Sunday 2pm\nAnother six-pointer? There is an argument that Burnley\u2019s visit to Brentford constitutes one of those, given Sean Dyche\u2019s side can catch up with the Bees by winning their two games in hand. Brentford have played more times than anyone in the bottom half and are far from out of the woods, although last weekend\u2019s convincing win at Norwich offered huge relief after a torrid run. Safety will loom into view if they can break Burnley down. Christian Eriksen\u2019s presence could work wonders, given the guile he has added. The Danish playmaker was excellent against the Canaries in his first start and has returned in remarkably good shape. Burnley were brought sharply down to earth from their upturn in form by successive home defeats to Leicester and Chelsea, and this is not the time for grinding out draws. NA\nBrentford v Burnley, Saturday 3pm\nAs one of only two teams to have beaten Manchester City in the Premier League this season, Crystal Palace may be one of the biggest obstacles remaining between Pep Guardiola\u2019s side and another title triumph. Aymeric Laporte certainly cannot dispute that claim. The centre-back seems very likely to start with R\u00faben Dias out injured, but was given the run-around by Palace in October. Laporte was dispossessed in the build-up Palace\u2019s first goal and was tormented by Wilfried Zaha for 45 minutes before getting himself sent off for hacking the forward down. Liverpool, who certainly know what it is like to blow a title chance at Selhurst Park, will be hoping for more of the same on Monday. PD\nCrystal Palace v Manchester City, Monday 8pm\nIt\u2019s been a mixed start at Villa Park for Steven Gerrard. In 14 league games, his team have beaten just one side currently sitting in the top half of the table \u2013 Southampton, last week. And there remain questions about Gerrard\u2019s management. Perhaps he got lucky at Rangers, taking advantage of Celtic\u2019s unsuccessful rehiring of Neil Lennon. Gerrard\u2019s old side, meanwhile, look just as good under Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Though he\u2019s still learning the role, the importance of a \u201cwell done\u201d from someone of his standing as a player should not be underestimated. He may have hit upon the formation which serves his best players best. The 4-3-1-2 he has adopted gives him solidity and enterprise in midfield, allows Philippe Coutinho to roam, and imposes both Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings upon opposing centre-backs. Villa should fancy their chances against a weary West Ham. DH\nWest Ham v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm\nIn addition to Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl\u2019s gripes about Newcastle\u2019s January signings and their postponed meeting, he now has some good old-fashioned fixture congestion to deal with, with three matches to play in nine days. After a heartening run, last weekend\u2019s heavy defeat by Aston Villa was a significant wobble. The return of Mohammed Salisu, one of Saints\u2019 outstanding performers this season among a buoyant squad, is a reason to be cheerful and to enjoy for now. Trying to hang on to Saints\u2019 best players, such as Salisu, in the summer will shift into focus over the coming weeks. LM\nSouthampton v Watford, Sunday 2pm",

        "content": "Matt Reeves\u2019 film conjured a noirish cityscape where criminals must be out-thought rather than out-fought. But what now?\nPerhaps the most splendid payoff from Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman is that it has the potential for opening up an entire Batverse of movies and TV shows. This is a movie that resets the dark knight mythos in the same way Batman Begins did in 2005 after the debacle that was Batman & Robin. For long-term fans of the caped crusader, it\u2019s like a warm bath in all that Gotham City good stuff, with the implication that more mysteries lurk around every corner for Batman as he cuts through corrupt cops and hardboiled gangsters.\nSo what comes next? We already know that Colin Farrell\u2019s remarkable, unrecognisable turn as Oswald Cobblepot is to be rewarded with a spin-off TV show that will screen on HBO Max in the US. And there are also rumours that Arkham Asylum, which by the end of Reeves\u2019 movie has been revealed as the new home of not just Paul Dano\u2019s Riddler but also Barry Keoghan\u2019s Joker, will form the basis of a second segue to the small screen. It\u2019s more than possible Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman might turn up from time to time in either, but both shows will have to find storylines that swirl far beyond his immediate sphere of influence.\nThe Batman ends with the Joker and the Riddler at the apparent beginning of a poisonous friendship, a development that could drive the proposed Arkham Asylum series forward if Warner Bros decides to borrow from the storyline of the classic comic book War of Jokes and Riddles. But what about The Bat\u2019s next big-screen outing?\nReeves has already gone on record to say that any sequel will most likely feature a different supervillain and that the climactic reveal should not be read as a Marvel-style setup up for future episodes (though Christopher Nolan pulled a similar trick in Batman Begins and did go on to give us the definitive Batman/Joker film). But it tallies with the sense that Reeves is ploughing his own unorthodox furrow with Gotham\u2019s favourite son.\nMoreover, if the deliciously languid pace of The Batman is to be echoed in future instalments, Reeves needs to retain the air of foreboding and enigma that allowed Battinson to slip into \u201cworld\u2019s greatest detective\u201d mode. Dano\u2019s brutal Riddler was the perfect foil, but other villains who employ subterfuge and sleight of hand, such as Hush or Ra\u2019s Al Ghul, might fit the new template more comfortably thanmore physical enemies such as Bane.\nReeves has suggested that Hush is in his thoughts, though not necessarily for The Batman\u2019s sequel. And there are even hints in his film that Thomas Elliot, who has ready-made connections to the Riddler and Catwoman, could already be present in this arty and unhurried take on Gotham City. Then again, so could any of the caped crusader\u2019s traditional rogue\u2019s gallery of supervillains.\nThat\u2019s the beauty of The Batman and its vision of Gotham City as an enormous, spiky puzzle waiting to be solved. We\u2019re right at the beginning of this epic comic book conundrum, and there\u2019s no knowing which dark and dastardly players are biding their time for the later, ever-more lucrative climactic rounds.",

The West should counter with its own energy-saving measures\nThis piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian\u2019s climate crisis newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week\u2019s biggest environment stories every Thursday\nTurning down the thermostat by 1C might not sound like much of a gesture when thousands of people are being killed in Vladimir Putin\u2019s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, but it may be one of the few ways by which ordinary people in Europe, and around the world, can make an impact on the horrific events.\nEurope is highly dependent on Russian gas, which makes up 45% of EU gas imports. And with prices sky-high \u2013 partly because of Putin\u2019s actions \u2013 an estimated $500m a day is pouring into Russian coffers to fight the Kremlin\u2019s war. If Europe wants to stop Putin, sanctions are needed, but so too are alternative sources of energy. The Ukraine war has starkly revealed a truth that governments failed to learn from throughout the climate crisis: that energy is a matter of national security, and getting off fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable power is a source of strength.\nPutin tightened the flow of Russian gas to Europe by about a quarter in the months leading up to his invasion, and prices have soared in response. He has used Russia\u2019s dominance of Europe\u2019s gas market as an \u201ceconomic and political weapon\u201d, the chief of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said last week. The global energy watchdog laid out a 10-point proposal showing how Europe could reduce its consumption of Russian gas by about a third, including advice to consumers to turn down their thermostats by only 1C, from an average of 22C to an average of 21C \u2013 a level that maintains comfort and that most people will barely notice, but which will save about 10bn cubic metres out of the 155bn imported annually from Russia.\nOther measures could save more: ramping up renewable energy; insulating homes; a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies that have enjoyed a bonanza amid high energy prices, with the proceeds used to reduce bills for hard-pressed consumers; and delaying the planned closure of several nuclear power stations.\nAll these are likely to be needed, and more. There is a serious danger, too, that governments will seek return to the coal-fired power stations they were phasing out \u2013 though they should note that about half of the coal used in the EU is imported from Russia.\nEuropean countries are now re-evaluating their energy systems as a matter of urgency, and the results will help determine how the bloc tackles the climate crisis.\nIronically, amid all this: Russia, if it wanted, could make a massive difference to the climate crisis, and at no cost. The IEA also found, in a separate report, that Russia is one of the biggest emitters of methane, the main component of natural gas, through its ageing and poorly constructed fossil fuel production infrastructure. Simply plugging those leaks \u2013 which would be profitable, because more gas could then be sold \u2013 could go a long way to help reduce temperature rises by 0.2C in the 2040s. But a country willing to slaughter today\u2019s children with bombs and bullets is unlikely to balk at killing tomorrow\u2019s through climate breakdown.",

The first time that happened was at the beginning of the pandemic. That was one of the most important events in my life, and I felt a responsibility and duty to write something.\n\u201cThen this great big mess came along, and I feel the same way. My head is full of images and language and ideas, and it\u2019s almost a relief to set things down on paper.\u201d\nThe poem was a \u201crefracted version of what is coming at us in obscene images through the news\u201d. Reports from Ukraine were both compelling and difficult to watch, he said. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t sit through both the 6pm and 10pm news bulletins.\u201d\nThe poem repeats the words \u201cit\u2019s war again\u201d several times, in reference to successive conflicts in recent history. \u201cThere\u2019s a weariness in the poem; here we go again,\u201d said Armitage.\n\u201cBut [the poem] is also a form of resistance, I hope. There\u2019s not a lot I can do, sitting here. But writing it down, taking ownership of the terrible images, feels a positive act.\u201d\nPoetry had an \u201cunbroken relationship with conflict and war, going right back to the Iliad\u201d, said Armitage. He pointed to the famous generation of first world war poets \u2013 \u201cthe bloggers of their day\u201d \u2013 and to Tony Harrison\u2019s poems about more recent wars in the Gulf and Bosnia.\nWhile evoking the desperate urgency of escaping death and destruction, Armitage\u2019s poem ends on a note of hope: \u201cAn air-raid siren can\u2019t fully mute the cathedral bells.\u201d\nIt was not clear yet whether the world was at a truly pivotal moment, he said.\n\u201cI was talking to somebody the other day who\u2019d been a young man at the height of the cold war and the Bay of Pigs crisis, and he said he used to go to bed not knowing whether he\u2019d wake up in the morning.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet. But in terms of catastrophe, tragedy, this feels as real and raw as anything I can remember. And the stakes are very high.\u201d",

He was teargassed, bombed, shot at, had a Scud missile fired at him, was trapped in a mine field, had a stun grenade dropped on his head, was irradiated, covered in toxic waste, trapped inside an upturned boat, faced a firing squad and nearly died in a helicopter crash.\nBorn in Buckland, Oxfordshire, David was the youngest of five boys. In 1962 his parents, Reginald and Elizabeth (nee Wright), took over the Red Lion pub in Avebury, Wiltshire, where he spent his early teenage years. In 1966, aged 16, he followed three of his older brothers to sea and joined the merchant navy. He signed up to Greenpeace on a voluntary basis in 1982, and the following year became the first paid crew member of one of their ships.\nFormer colleagues recount that he was rarely in the spotlight but was frequently the mastermind behind high-profile campaigns. He had a talent for motivating people and thinking up hare-brained, out-of-the-box, but essentially peaceful direct action strategies. He was instrumental in the logistics involving the escape of Greenpeace\u2019s Sirius ship from detention after an action against Bayer in Antwerp in 1985; in penetrating the security shield protecting a plutonium shipment in the Panama Canal in 1998; and, in 2003, in helping to block a shipment of arms to Iraq.\nDavid was a larger-than-life character and this, together with his imposing height, red hair, explosive temper and immense sense of humour, meant he made an impression on all he met.\nIn his lifetime he travelled to more than 130 countries and sent his children, and later his grandchildren, a postcard from nearly every place he visited.\nAt heart David was a naturalist, and in retirement he loved nothing better than studying trees or watching birds. He was a talented wood craftsman. In his last months, when he was not recounting tales of his adventures on his blog, he was converting a van, Marjorie, into a home to travel around Europe. He was a big fan of John Lennon and the Beatles, and was passionate about politics and world affairs.\nAs a family, we had no real idea what he had been getting up to in his professional life until after he died, when the numerous tributes to him from colleagues gave us an insight into some of his adventures.\nHe is survived by six children \u2013 Jemima and me from his first marriage to Susan Roberts (nee Jeary), which ended in divorce, Maia from his relationship with Lorena Lastra, and L\u00e9o, Sam and John from his second marriage, to Katia Kanas, which also ended in divorce \u2013 as well as his grandchildren, Tabitha, Myfanwy, Gwynfi, Violet and Adrian, and three brothers, Ian, Michael and Christopher.",

But it said the airport would feel significantly busier than that because of additional pre-departure checks, and it needed to embark on a recruitment drive.\n\u201cThis is higher than current airline, handler and airport capacity,\u201d Heathrow said. \u201cSo we are putting passengers first by gearing up across the airport for peak demand, working with airlines to reduce check-in times and recruiting 12,000 new colleagues, as well as reopening terminal 4 before July.\u201d\nHeathrow added that it was \u201cparticularly concerned over Border Force\u2019s ability to scale up to meet demand\u201d for the summer crowds. Failures in passport e-gates as well as additional Covid requirements have at times caused long queues in the immigration halls.\nIts rival London airport, Gatwick, has also predicted a summer surge, with passenger levels returning to 85% of pre-pandemic levels.\nIt said earlier this week that it expects to serve about 3 million passengers a month this summer, and will reopen its second terminal at the end of March, when British Airways will restart short-haul flights from the airport.\nHeathrow, however, warned that the immediate recovery in inbound traveller numbers remained slow because of testing and quarantine requirements in many overseas markets, and the aviation industry faced a host of additional concerns.\n\u201cWe also face headwinds from higher fuel prices, longer flight times to destinations impacted by airspace closures, concerns from US travellers over war in Europe and the likelihood of new \u2018variants of concern\u2019,\u201d the airport said. \u201cTogether [these] create huge uncertainty over the passenger forecasts this year.\u201d\nHeathrow had a weaker start to the year than anticipated because the Omicron variant dented hopes of an early recovery after a year in which passenger numbers fell to 19.4 million, its lowest level for nearly half a century, and the airport reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a31.8bn.\nHeathrow has angered airlines by planning to raise landing charges by more than 50% as it seeks to allay cumulative losses of \u00a33.8bn during the pandemic.\nThe rise in charges to airlines will typically add less than 2% to passenger air fares, the airport has said, although airlines have denounced the rise at a hub which they say is already the costliest in Europe. Heathrow says the rise in charges, to be approved by the aviation regulator, the CAA, is necessary for urgent investment in screening and baggage systems.",

Plus, the chefs cooking in solidarity with Ukraine\nGood morning.\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of being a \u201cterrorist state\u201dafter its tanks prevented a delivery of food, water and medicine to the besieged city of Mariupol, and he said Moscow was capable of chemical weapons attacks.\nAs Russian forces appeared to be regrouping in order to encircle Kyiv, and the US planned to ratchet up the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin, Zelenskiy tried to rally Ukrainians with another video address late on Thursday condemning the relentless assault on cities.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister said Russian forces had killed more Ukrainian civilians than soldiers, and Russian forces have been accused of hitting a psychiatric hospital near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izyum.\n\u201cThis is a war crime against civilians, genocide against the Ukrainian nation,\u201d the regional governor of Kharkiv said. Russia denies targeting civilians.\nWhat else is happening? Here\u2019s everything we know on day 16 of the Russian invasion.\nWhat happens if Russia cannot pay its debts after western sanctions? While Russia would have had enough foreign currency to cover debt payments, having amassed $630bn in reserves, the US, UK and EU freezing the assets of its central bank have made much of this sum inaccessible. This means it could default.\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s past has raised fears of a large-scale cyberwar  targeting Ukraine and its allies, including the US.\nThe likelihood of a criminal investigation and charges against Donald Trump are rising. This is due to allegations by a House panel of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d involving his aggressive drive to overturn the 2020 election results, coupled with a Department of Justice inquiry into a \u201cfalse electors\u201d scheme that Trump loyalists devised to block Joe Biden from taking office.\nFormer federal prosecutors say evidence is mounting of criminal conduct by Trump that may yield charges of obstructing an official proceeding of Congress on 6 January or defrauding the US government, stemming from his weeks-long drive with senior allies to thwart Biden\u2019s inauguration by pushing false claims of fraud.\nA 2 March court filing by the House January 6 panel implicated Trump in a conspiracy to block Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s win, and Trump faces legal threats from investigations under way into the \u201cfalse electors\u201d ploy, and seditious conspiracy charges filed against Oath Keepers who attacked the Capitol, say department veterans.\nWhat has the House panel said? The filing by the House panel stated that it had \u201ca good-faith basis for concluding that the president and members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States\u201d.\nThe actor Jussie Smollett has been sentenced to 30 months of probation, including 150 days of jail time, and ordered to pay restitution after his conviction for lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack that he orchestrated himself.\nSmollett, who is Black and gay, reported to police that two men wearing ski masks beat him and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him on a dark Chicago street. The 39-year-old was also ordered to pay $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago and fined $25,000 by Judge James Linn of Cook county circuit court.\nLinn denied a request to suspend Smollett\u2019s sentence and ordered he be placed in custody immediately. After the sentencing, Smollett removed the face mask he wore throughout the hearing to loudly proclaim his innocence.\nWhat did he say? \u201cIf I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of Black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBT community,\u201d Smollett said, standing up at the defense table as his lawyers and sheriff\u2019s deputies surrounded him. \u201cYour honor, I respect you and I respect the jury but I did not do this.\u201d\nThe election of an avowed \u201canti-feminist\u201d as the next president of South Korea has been greeted with dismay, amid accusations that Yoon Suk-yeol has fueled the county\u2019s gender divide. A former senior prosecutor, Yoon defeated the liberal ruling party candidate, Lee Jae-myung, by a margin of 263,000 votes.\nThe mysterious discovery of a mummified body in the walls of a historic convention center in Oakland, California, has prompted an urgent search for answers, as authorities seek to untangle the person\u2019s identity and how they came to be entombed within the building\u2019s walls.\nThe actor and singer Emilio Delgado, a warm and familiar presence in children\u2019s lives for 45 years as the fix-it shop owner Luis on Sesame Street, has died. His wife, Carol Delgado, said he died from the blood cancer multiple myeloma at their home in New York. He was 81.\nAs many as a third of all child deaths from Covid in the US have occurred during the Omicron surge of the pandemic. Children seem to be facing increasing risks from Covid-19, even as mask mandates drop across the country and vaccination rates among children stall out at alarmingly low rates.\nUS inflation surged again last month to a new 40-year high of 7.9%, propelled by surging costs for gas, food and housing. The February figures, the sharpest increase since 1982, are only a foretaste of higher prices to come as they do not factor in the impacts of the Ukraine war, Biden\u2019s ban on Russian energy imports and tightened oil supplies have sent prices at US gas stations and other energy commodities to record levels.\nIn Culver City, a Chinese restaurant is selling bright blue and yellow \u201cfreedom dumplings\u201d, the colors of the Ukrainian flag. In West Hollywood, a popular cocktail bar is offering a special \u201cPruzhnyy\u201d, or resilience, cocktail, made with Ukrainian Khor vodka. Bakeries across California are making special batches of hamentaschen, a Jewish cookie associated with resistance. It\u2019s all part of a wave of solidarity among California chefs, who are using food to show support for Ukrainians after Russia\u2019s invasion and to fundraise for humanitarian relief efforts.\nAs Biden ratchets up the pressure on Russia by banning imports of its oil, and American drivers grumble about rising gasoline prices, a more fundamental demand has emerged \u2013 for the US to decisively cut its umbilical reliance on fossil fuels. Environmental groups and progressive Democrats are aiming to build on the backlash to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by ending the era of fossil fuel dependency and help address the unfolding climate crisis.\nOn Monday, as the world watched the war in Ukraine intensify, Nikolai Plyuyko did something extraordinary. He went for an 11km run through the streets of Kyiv. He\u2019s not the only one. In the south of the city, Konstantin Bondarev, 61, has been running long distances since 1983. \u201cNow that there has been war, I\u2019ve been running non-stop; it makes things feel a lot easier during such turbulent times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to show that we are alive and strong.

        "content": "Workers are calling for the National Labor Relations Board to ban captive audience meetings and make organizing easier\nAmerican workers attempting to form unions in their workplaces are pushing the National Labor Relations Board to expand organizing rights \u2013 from reinstating the Joy Silk doctrine that makes unionization easier, to banning captive audience meetings held by employers to discourage organizing efforts.\nTheir efforts could transform how unions organize workers in the US, especially amid opposition from employers.\nMax Capasso, who has worked as a barista at Great Lakes Coffee in Detroit for six months, is one of about 20 workers at the coffee chain currently on strike, demanding their employer recognize their union and collectively bargain with workers.\nIn January, Capasso said, nine baristas at the Midtown location in Detroit tested positive for Covid-19, and management insisted the remaining workers, despite having been exposed, still come into work. The company denies that workers were asked to come into work sick.\nCapasso and others had been communicating with each other about working conditions and low pay, but the Covid-19 issue prompted them to sign a joint letter requesting that management provide hazard pay and not demand workers return to work without being cleared of the virus.\nIn response, the store location was shut down indefinitely, which incited the union organizing effort with Unite Here Local 24. Twenty out of 24 workers have signed union authorization cards and have been on strike since 16 February to demand recognition.\n\u201cWe clearly have a vast majority, we\u2019ve clearly proven that we are dedicated to this strike and we are dedicated to this union and getting a contract, and they have refused to acknowledge it,\u201d said Capasso. \u201cWe are seeking a higher authority to force their hand and come sit at the table with us.\u201d\nDuring the third week of the strike, workers filed unfair labor practice charges against Great Lakes Coffee with the NLRB, requesting the board reinstate the Joy Silk doctrine, a policy which stipulates an employer must recognize and bargain collectively with a union unless they have a \u201cgood faith doubt\u201d of majority support for the union.\nGreat Lakes Coffee did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the filing.\nThis would make it easier for workers to form unions as they would not have to hold ballot elections to do so, and under Joy Silk, employers would be forced to bargain collectively with the union if found to have broken labor law during a union election process.\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly expressed support for expanding union organizing rights, most recently during the State of the Union address. During the speech, Biden said that \u201cwhen a majority of workers want to form a union they shouldn\u2019t be stopped,\u201d which was reaffirming support for the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which passed the House last year but has yet to receive a Senate vote.\nBiden\u2019s new appointees to the NLRB, including the general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, have called for several types of cases for regional offices to bring to the NLRB general counsel office, outlining the office\u2019s priorities, including consideration of requesting the NLRB reinstate Joy Silk, which was abandoned by the NLRB around 1970.\n\u201cGiven the many years that we have had since Joy Silk was abandoned, we\u2019ve seen over those years, decade upon decade, employers abuse their power at the workplace where they intimidate employees\u2019 efforts to unionize,\u201d said Risa Lieberwitz, a professor of law and employment law at Cornell University. \u201cBringing Joy Silk back would be a doctrine that more fully respects workers\u2019 rights to unionize.\u201d\nLieberwitz said banning captive audience meetings will probably be more difficult, given employer opposition in citing first amendment rights. But there could be other ways for the board to address the coercive nature of captive audience meetings, such as granting unions equal access and time with workers.\n\u201cNow is a chance with a new board and this very creative general counsel to really take actions to engage in review and rethinking about how to make the NLRB work the way it was supposed to,\u201d said Lieberwitz.\nWorkers trying to unionize at Amazon in New York and Starbucks workers in Alabama have filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB to push for the board to ban captive audience meetings held by employers to discourage unionization efforts, a policy that is also included in the Pro Act.\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely inherently coercive and we feel absolutely disgusted by Amazon\u2019s union-busting tactics,\u201d said Brett Daniels, an Amazon worker and organizer at JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York. \u201cThey need to end and should be banned.\u201d\nDaniels said that workers are regularly forced to attend captive audience meetings held by Amazon throughout their work week.\nUnder the Trump administration, the NLRB fought to overturn state laws that prohibited or limited employers\u2019 use of captive audience meetings during union campaigns, claiming bans limit the free speech of employers.\n\u201cThere are no first amendment rights there, people are forced to go there. The unions have no way to respond to it and they lie to them,\u201d said Seth Goldstein, a pro bono attorney for the Amazon Labor Union. \u201cCaptive audience meetings are inherently coercive and the board has to take action.\u201d\nAmazon is publicly and aggressively opposing unionization in their warehouses, with a rerun election currently being held in Alabama after the initial results in 2021 were overturned due to Amazon\u2019s conduct during the election. Amazon is pushing workers to vote no in the NLRB elections that the board ordered after a majority of workers expressed interest in unionization through union authorization cards.\nAmazon and Starbucks have rejected criticisms of captive audience meetings, dubbing them \u201cregular informational meetings\u201d or \u201clistening sessions\u201d.\nOregon has a ban on captive audience meetings and Connecticut is currently debating legislation that would grant employees the right to leave these meetings, which business groups strongly oppose.",

        "content": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine reverberates in Brighton Beach, home to one of the world\u2019s largest concentrations of immigrants from the former Soviet Union\nFor years, the sign for Taste of Russia, a grocery store in Brooklyn\u2019s Russian-speaking immigrant community of Brighton Beach, featured the distinctive domes of St Basil\u2019s cathedral in Red Square. But soon after Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the owners of the shop took the sign down. In the window, they hung a large blue and yellow Ukrainian flag.\n\u201cWe felt that it was divisive,\u201d said co-owner Elena Rakhman, citing feedback from longtime customers who told her they no longer felt comfortable shopping in a store named after Russia. Several of her employees are from Ukraine and have family members there.\nFew people in Brighton Beach, home to one of the world\u2019s largest concentrations of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, are indifferent to Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Many were themselves refugees from Soviet Ukraine and are horrified to see Russian artillery shells hit apartment buildings and a new generation torn from their homes by an oppressive regime.\nRakhman said removing Russia from her store\u2019s name was not intended to diminish the local Russian community and while some people are angry, others have thanked them for supporting Ukraine. While the store\u2019s awning remains bare for now, the owners plan to announce a new name that is \u201cinclusive of our entire immigrant population, rather than just Russia\u201d as soon as their new sign is delivered.\nBrighton Beach became known as \u201cLittle Odessa\u201d after tens of thousands of Russian-speaking Soviet Jews, many from the Black Sea port in Ukraine, settled there in the 1970s. When Rakhman arrived from Odessa as a toddler with her family in 1974, she said, the community didn\u2019t delineate between those from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus or other Soviet republics: \u201cWe were all just Soviet refugees trying to find our way and helping each other.\u201d\nThe breakup of the Soviet Union brought another wave of immigrants to Brighton in the 1990s, followed by more recent arrivals from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia and other former Soviet nations, drawn by their shared knowledge of Russian and job opportunities for those who speak it.\nOn a recent visit to the neighborhood, where Cyrillic signs abound and pensioners descend from their high-rise apartments to gather on the boardwalk and gossip in Russian, there were visible signs of solidarity with Ukraine. Mannequins in the window display of Exclusive Women\u2019s Wear on Brighton Beach Avenue sported blue and yellow outfits, and a large Ukrainian flag dangled from a plastic skirt hanger. Flyers in the checkout line at the NetCost supermarket urged people to donate to humanitarian relief efforts and the Ukrainian army. The company, founded by Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union, said it will work with its food suppliers abroad to feed displaced Ukrainians and provide jobs for those that make their way to the United States.\nSitting in the office of his daughter\u2019s shipping business not far off Brighton\u2019s main drag, Vakhtang Tsankashvili, 68, a physicist who came to New York 20 years ago from Georgia, denounced the war and said people in Russia \u201cmust come to their senses\u201d and stand up to Putin.\nNearby, the owner of the Magic Door gift shop, who declined to give his name but said he had emigrated from Odessa in 1990, estimated that 90% of people in the neighborhood support Ukraine. The owner placed Ukrainian flags in his store window and said he had sold four Russian flags that day \u2013 to Ukrainians who planned to burn them at a protest in Times Square.\nDown on the Brighton Beach boardwalk, some anti-war Russians on 6 March rallied around a brand-new flag they have chosen to represent them: a single blue band on a white background.\n\u201cWe decided we can no longer use the Russian tricolor, because Putin has turned it into a fascist symbol,\u201d said Alex Zaporozhtsev, an activist with the group For Freedom in Russia, which has organized protests against the Putin regime for over seven years. \u201cWe decided to take away the red stripe \u2013 it\u2019s the color of blood \u2013 and make it white.\u201d He said the new flag was conceived in a group chat for Russian opposition activists living around the world and made its debut shortly after the invasion.\nNearby on the boardwalk, Artem Danilchick, 34, stood draped in his own flag, the red-and-white one used by opposition activists in Belarus. He fled his native Minsk after participating in the country\u2019s massive protests in 2020, which were brutally suppressed by President Alexander Lukashenko with support from Moscow.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the fact that I\u2019m from Belarus, but I\u2019m very ashamed of what is going on,\u201d he said, referring to Russian missiles launched at Ukraine from Belarus. \u201cNobody supports this war.\u201d\nWhile many other Belarusians are traveling to Ukraine to join the fight against Russia, \u201cNow I\u2019m here and participating in these protests is practically all I can do right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if I go to Belarus I will not leave in the next five to 10 years.\u201d\nSophia Zhukovsky, 22, whose parents fled Russia 30 years ago as the Soviet Union was collapsing, came from Long Island to join the protest on her birthday because \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of any place that I\u2019d rather be.\u201d She was distraught over the war in Ukraine and worried about her relatives still in Russia as the authorities crack down on dissent and the rouble crashes.\nHer friend Anton Kobrin, also 22, whose parents emigrated from Tomsk in Siberia, said the war had caused tensions with some relatives in Russia. \u201cMy grandparents at this point are so brainwashed from the propaganda there that they genuinely think that this is like a \u2018military operation\u2019. They\u2019re liberating Ukraine from, from what I don\u2019t know \u2026 it breaks my heart that even my grandparents don\u2019t want to talk to me or the rest of my family about it because they just don\u2019t believe what we say.\u201d\nActivists note there is a contingent of Russian speakers in Brighton Beach, particularly older immigrants who watch Russian television, who support Putin and buy the Kremlin\u2019s narrative about Ukraine. \u201cI have an impression that\u2019s a personal choice, to watch Russian television and to believe it or not,\u201d said Alexander Korzun, 36, who came from Moscow five years ago.\nThere are \u201cabsolutely\u201d people in the community who back Putin but are not very vocal, said Yelena Goltsman, who emigrated from Kyiv in 1989 as a young mother. In 2008, Goltsman founded a support network for Russian-speaking LGBTQ+ people that has held pride parades in Brighton Beach. The group\u2019s name, RUSA-LGBT, is an abbreviation for Russian-Speaking American LGBT Association and it has members from countries across the former Soviet Union. Since the invasion, they are discussing \u201cchanging our name without changing our identity as Russian speakers, LGBT people\u201d in order to remove the association with Russia.\nImmigrants from Russia \u201chave nothing to do with those decisions that are based in the Kremlin\u201d, said Michael Levitis, who came from Moscow at age 12 in 1987 and hosts a Russian radio show on Radio Freedom FM 104.7. \u201cWe still have to be very proud of our culture, of our Russian influence, of our language, our history, our education.\u201d\nLevitis, who owned a glitzy Russian restaurant in the area before pleading guilty to fraud in 2014, remains well-connected in the community and now runs a Facebook group for Russian speakers with over 17,000 members, where the war currently dominates discussion.\nWhile most people in the group are supportive of Ukraine, \u201cthere\u2019s a variety of opinions about who\u2019s at fault for starting this war\u201d, he said. \u201cThere are some voices that are saying look, we definitely want the bloodshed to stop \u2026 however, we feel that Putin had his concerns that were not met during negotiations by the Ukrainian government, by the US and European leaders and Nato.\u201d Levitis said he had also seen many people who were previously ardent Putin supporters and backed the annexation of Crimea in 2014 say that they no longer support the Russian leader because the most recent invasion \u201cwent too far\u201d.\nGoltsman and others who have been protesting against Putin for the last decade wish the international community had put more pressure on him and his allies earlier, before it got to this point. \u201cNone of us is guilty in what\u2019s happening, but everyone is responsible,\u201d she said.\nRUSA-LGBT members have been raising money for Ukrainians, translating lists of necessary medical supplies, helping people identify routes out of the country and connecting them with volunteers who can assist them. For Goltsman, watching the violence unfold in her native country, where she still has family and friends, is agonizing. \u201cNo matter how much I provide help, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d she said, her voice wavering.\nDaniel Price, a 19-year-old sophomore at Brooklyn College born to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants in America, said he was committed to helping a country he\u2019s never been to, where his ancestors experienced generations of persecution. His great-great-grandfather was a Jewish leader in western Ukraine who was imprisoned by the Soviet Union for gathering the local religious community. One of his great-grandfathers and both of his grandfathers fought against the Nazis in the Red Army during the second world war.\nPrice spent his early childhood in Bensonhurst, a south Brooklyn neighborhood with a sizable Russian-speaking population not far from Brighton Beach, and later returned there to volunteer at the Marks Jewish Community House, which serves as a hub for the local Russian-speaking Jewish community. He\u2019s collecting headlamps and flashlights for the \u201cpartisans\u201d in Ukraine and inviting other teens to come together through anti-war protests and relief efforts.\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here on my phone in New York watching what could have been my neighbors\u2019 houses get destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to do something.\u201d",

        "content": "Bristol Old VicWith brilliant performances, eye-popping visuals and a gloriously profane script by Ross Willis, this is an unforgettable tale of adolescence\nHere is an audaciously inventive, sparky yet sensitive, giddily enjoyable new play that deserves to be packed to the rafters with kids on school trips. Ross Willis has created an extraordinary exploration of adolescence with his tale of 12-year-old Sonny, who invents a superhero, Captain Chatter, to help him with his stammer. It is brilliantly performed in this dream of a production from director Sally Cookson, complete with eye-popping projections, a lurid lime-and-orange colour scheme and stunningly expressive physicality all round.\nRaphel Famotibe makes a confident stage debut as Sonny, whose homemade comic books introduce us to Captain Chatter (the superb Ramesh Meyyappan, dressed as a sort of space-age sprinter). Sonny\u2019s relationship with him veers from sidekick to nemesis: Captain Chatter helps save him from having to speak in public but Sonny must ultimately learn to live without him, especially when he lands a role in his school\u2019s production of Hamlet.\nThis push-and-pull is reflected in Sonny\u2019s new friendship with the lippy Roshi (a barnstorming Juliet Agnes), who lives on his estate, and his relationship with his teacher Miss Wainwright (Amanda Lawrence, hardboiled yet soft-centred). Wainwright is locked in battle with the callous headteacher, Miss Fish, who is the school\u2019s real bully and symbolises a wider ideology of labelling children rather than striving to understand them. Jenny Fitzpatrick, in hiss-worthy mode as Miss Fish, doubles as Sonny\u2019s mother in scenes that sting with sadness. The play considers specific experiences and misconceptions around stammering alongside other themes of communication, especially regarding mental health.\nWillis\u2019s mastery of words is matched by the fonts used in the creative captioning on screen from designer Tom Newell: comic-book kapows jostle with Shakespeare, ghoulish grindhouse dialogue with textspeak, heartfelt eloquence with a flood of F-bombs from teachers and students alike, institutional jargon with scatological puns. As the insults ping (\u201cMiss, did you fight in the second world war?\u201d), it feels as if the whole thing is harnessing the energy of a Year 8 classroom.\nWillis can make quotidian detail startling: a missing dog sign is printed in comic sans, the description of someone\u2019s eye colour becomes an insult. Even the stage directions ping: \u201cSonny rips out his vocal cords\u201d leads to one particularly haunting physical sequence.\nLaila Diallo\u2019s movement direction is felt in every performance, from Sonny\u2019s fury and frustration to Miss Fish\u2019s officious strut. Katie Sykes\u2019 design \u2013 lit by Aideen Malone \u2013 consistently surprises (those weaponised quills!) and there is a compelling variety in Benji Bower\u2019s electro score, played by a band above the stage, and in Jonathan Everett\u2019s sound.\nBy rights, this school-life play should go straight on the curriculum, and not just because it offers an eye-wateringly funny, expletive-laden synopsis of Hamlet and a richly resonant interpretation of Shakespeare\u2019s opening lines. Willis\u2019s play unfolds itself in miraculous ways. It\u2019s some kind of wonderful.\nWonder Boy is at Bristol Old Vic until 26 March and is streamed from 24-26 March",

        "content": "Leah Williamson and Kim Little reflect on the game\u2019s place in society after talking to women and girls who fled their homes\nKim Little and her Arsenal teammate Leah Williamson are reflecting on the role football can play in changing lives. The pair have just left a close to hour-long Zoom call with women and girls in the Za\u2019atari refugee camp in Jordan, the world\u2019s largest such camp for Syrians who have fled the war in their homeland.\n\u201cWe play football and people watch us, but I think for us, as a club, as a team and as individuals, the societal impact is way more important,\u201d Little says. \u201cThat\u2019s more lasting past football. When we retire from playing it\u2019s not just: \u2018Oh, I played OK on the pitch, we did this, we won this.\u2019 Imagine if we can look back in five or 10 years\u2019 time, when I\u2019m not playing, and can say we maybe had an impact on ordinary people\u2019s lives to go and study law or travel? I\u2019d take that any day over winning trophies.\u201d\nOn Zoom on International Women\u2019s Day were two junior coaches, 16-year-old Nada and 17-year-old Sondos, a 42-year-old mother of five and coach, Salma, and 12-year-old Reem. All are a part of the Coaching for Life programme co-created by the Arsenal Foundation and Save the Children that is in its seventh 20-week cycle.\n\u201cI used to live in Bloudan, a village near Damascus,\u201d Salma says. \u201cAs the situation got worse there, I moved to Daraa [near the Jordan border] in 2012 but it was still dangerous. In Daraa, a sniper shot my 16-year-old son and he died from the injury five days later. I fled Syria with my then husband and children and arrived at the Za\u2019atari refugee camp in 2013.\u201d\nNada arrived with her three sisters and one brother in 2014; Sondos arrived in 2012 with 10 family members and joined Coaching for Life with her 16-year-old divorced sister; Reem came aged two, brought by her parents with her three sisters and brother.\nLife in the camp is difficult, says the director of the Arsenal Foundation, Mairead King, who last visited in November: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty harsh. There isn\u2019t much colour and there isn\u2019t much life. Over the years the structures have become more permanent. It\u2019s corrugated structures, but you might have three or four families living in one of those. It\u2019s in the middle of the desert so everything\u2019s dusty and there\u2019s 80,000 people and 40,000 of them are kids. Maybe six years ago people still thought they would go back to Syria, but now people talk about the camp being their home. It\u2019s been a journey for many families to come to terms with that, to realise that they\u2019re actually probably not going back.\u201d\nGradually things have been added. There are schools, supermarkets and a street they call the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es where makeshift shops sell all sorts, even wedding dresses, but the buildings are basically shacks.\nThe one patch of green is home to the pitches built and operated by the Coaching for Life programme. The project, which you can donate to here, marries the Arsenal Foundation\u2019s experience of working with underprivileged kids in north London, including those involved in knife crime, to build a sense of belonging with Save the Children\u2019s experience of conflict areas and humanitarian crises.\n\u201cSome kids, particularly in the early days, when they were quite traumatised, were really withdrawn and they didn\u2019t want to go to school,\u201d King says. \u201cBut if a couple of their mates were going to a football pitch and there was a sense of play and a sense of fun, gradually you could cajole them out of themselves. Football has the power to do that, and has the power to bring them together, and then once we get them together, then that\u2019s when we can give psychosocial support.\u201d\nIn the past two years the rates of child marriage and gender-based violence have increased in the camp as pre-existing gender inequalities have been exacerbated by the pandemic. As part of the programme, which operates around schooling, girls are taught how to stand up for their rights to education, sport and how to advocate for themselves.\nAs Reem, Sondos and Nada quiz Williamson and Little on what goes through the players\u2019 heads when in a position to score or one-on-one in defence, who their role models are, what makes Little a good captain and whether they thought they might lose after conceding twice against Birmingham last Sunday, the problems of the camp feel very far away.\nPoignantly, when Williamson and Little ask the girls what their aspirations are, the ambition is not to be a footballer or coach: \u201cI want to continue my education and study law\u201d \u2026 \u201cI want to travel, I don\u2019t know where, outside the camp\u201d \u2026 \u201cI want Coaching for Life to expand to include children with disabilities that are bullied in school and the community\u201d \u2026 \u201cI want my children to all graduate.\u201d They leave the players speechless.\nThe experience has Williamson and Little thinking about football and its role. \u201cWe have conversations on the coach,\u201d says Williamson. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit and talk about everything but football really, but I\u2019m finding it hard at the minute, especially with Ukraine, that we keep stepping out on to a pitch and that life is normal here. I am battling with that a little bit. But at the same time, you struggle to find a place where you can actually have an impact and for us to have an impact on those girls is to go out and play well on the weekend.\u201d\nLittle adds: \u201cIt\u2019s not completely pointless because you are having an impact on people but in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s so irrelevant. In the football world, male and female, we are in this bubble and we get to do a job where we get this tunnel vision sometimes.\u201d\nWilliamson agrees: \u201cYou have to remember it is so irrelevant. It\u2019s an incredible, powerful thing that lots of good can come out of and right now us continuing to play, continuing to just be, is the best thing, because we can\u2019t do anything else. But if you offered me a chance to go and visit that camp at the weekend instead of playing my game it would be a moral dilemma. What\u2019s more important, when you actually really start to think about it? Yet we are in a performance sport where if we don\u2019t win, or if we don\u2019t play well, then we don\u2019t have that impact. So it\u2019s a constant existential conversation.\u201d\nLittle likes that. \u201cThat\u2019s a good mentality to have when you\u2019re going into anything,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the broader purpose? Football is a small part of the world but everything is there to make it go round.\u201d",

        "content": "Unlike the UK, EU countries have offered open sanctuary to the millions fleeing Russia\u2019s attack in biggest refugee crisis since second world war\nOver the past few days, images of desperate Ukrainian families being turned away by officials have thrown the UK\u2019s response to what has been termed the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war into stark contrast with its European neighbours.\nSo far the UK has refused to match the EU\u2019s decision to offer Ukrainians open sanctuary, instead operating a limited family reunification and humanitarian sponsorship system.\nA concession on Thursday from the Home Office, struggling to show that it is keeping on top of the situation, means that Ukrainians with passports will be able to apply for British visas online and give their biometric information once in the country, a marginal simplification of the web of bureaucracy that Ukrainians attempting to take refuge in the UK face.\nHowever on Tuesday, the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, stood in front of the European parliament and stated that all Ukrainians fleeing the war would continue to be welcomed with open arms by EU countries. \u201cMillions more will flee and we must welcome them,\u201d she said.\nWithin days of Russia\u2019s invasion, EU states decided to activate the hitherto unused Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), which gives any Ukrainian national the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years. They will also be able to access education and housing without having to claim asylum.\nOver the past 12 days, the EU has accepted more refugees than in the crisis of 2015 and 2016, when 1.3 million people applied for asylum in the 28 member states of the EU, Norway and Switzerland.\nThe majority of Ukrainian refugees have gone to neighbouring countries: more than 1.5 million in Poland, Hungary (about 225,000), Slovakia (176,000), Moldova (104,000), Romania (85,000), Belarus (860) and Russia (106,000).\nPoland has been the first point for Ukrainians escaping Russia\u2019s invasion, with more than 1.4 million already in the country, compared with 258,000 elsewhere in Europe, according to the UN\u2019s refugee agency. Tens of thousands more are crossing every day.\nA huge volunteer army has mobilised since the first refugee crossings to provide food, blankets and healthcare. Thousands of Polish families have also invited Ukrainians to stay in their homes.\nThe Polish parliament is considering a bill that would immediately give Ukrainians residency for 18 months and give financial aid to communities, local authorities and families hosting them.\nGermany had registered more than 80,000 refugees from Ukraine by Wednesday. The country has immediately given arrivals the right to work and children access to education. The country was also one of the first to offer free train travel from Poland, with volunteers on board providing food and water and helping Ukrainians access accommodation or arrange onward travel.\nFrance has been critical of the UK\u2019s \u201ctechnocratic\u201d approach and has itself received more than 7,500 refugees, the interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, said on Thursday.\nThe government said it was preparing to receive up 100,000 more in the coming weeks, and on a local level authorities and town halls are organising temporary accommodation, including for those arriving in Calais hoping to get visas for the UK. The French government has set up a website to help to connect families offering accommodation with charities.\nParis\u2019s Gare de l\u2019Est station has been a key welcoming point for the refugees, with volunteers helping arrivals with food and advice.\nItaly has one of Europe\u2019s largest Ukrainian communities and had taken in around 20,000 refugees by Wednesday, according to the government, with as many as 800,000 expected in total.\nIt has been testing arrivals for Covid-19 and offering vaccinations, while some of the refugees are being housed in former Covid quarantine hotels.\nSpain\u2019s regional presidents meet over the weekend to discuss how a country that has so far taken in around 2,000 Ukrainian nationals will prepare for further arrivals; it is readying reception places for up to 12,000 in the coming weeks and will extend its facilities to meet demand.\nEarlier this week, the interior ministry of the Czech Republic said the country had already taken in more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Four days after the Temporary Protection Directive was triggered by EU states on 3 March, the Czech government had already processed about 57,000 \u201cspecial\u201d visas, more than half of which went to children. The Czech Republic had a large Ukrainian diaspora of more than 197,000 before the war began.\nGreece has accepted about 7,000 Ukrainians since the refugee exodus began, according to migration ministry officials. This week the education minister, Niki Kerameus, said more than 1,000 refugee children, mostly from the war-torn country\u2019s sizeable ethnic Greek community, were poised to be enrolled in local schools, with special classes being set up for those who did not know the language.\nOn Wednesday Cyprus\u2019s interior ministry said close to 3,000 Ukrainians had flown into the Mediterranean island, itself partitioned by war, since 25 February, the day after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine. Of that number, 19 had sought asylum, the ministry said.",

But Gulf states are failing properly to investigate why so many migrant workers are dying.\nThe report, Vital Signs: The deaths of migrants in the Gulf, has been compiled by NGOs from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and the Philippines, and FairSquare Projects, a London-based migrant rights organisation.\nLow-paid migrant workers in the Gulf are exposed to a series of risks to their health, including heat and humidity, air pollution, overwork and abusive working conditions, poor occupational health and safety practices, psychosocial stress and hypertension. Long hours of manual labour in searing temperatures can result in heat stress, which can lead to organ damage, the report said.\nJulhas Uddin, a 37-year-old man from Bangladesh, died in Saudi Arabia in October 2017 when a supervisor instructed him to enter a sewerage line without an oxygen cylinder. No investigation was conducted, and his death certificate states the cause as \u201cheart and breathing stopped\u201d.\nThere are about 30 million migrants working in the Arab Gulf states \u2013 the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. About 80% of these are employed in low-paid sectors such as construction, hospitality and domestic work, and come from poorer countries in Asia and Africa.\n\u201cDespite the Gulf states\u2019 practical dependence on their migrant workforces and the bolstering impact migrant worker remittances have on the economies of their homelands, both origin and Gulf states have for too long paid inadequate attention to ensuring they return home in good health,\u201d said Anurag Devkota, a lawyer from Nepal\u2019s Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice. \u201cAs a result far too many do not return home at all, or do so in coffins or body bags.\u201d\nDespite widespread criticism of worker exploitation \u2013 notably in relation to Qatar\u2019s preparations to host this year\u2019s World Cup \u2013 the Gulf states have largely avoided structural labour reforms, and origin states have been unable to ensure proper protection for their nationals abroad.\nThe governments of the six Gulf countries did not respond to requests for comment.",

Last year\u2019s ceremony \u2013 held in a train station, don\u2019t forget \u2013 was watched by just a tiny dribble of viewers. This year, the lack of a televised Golden Globes has hobbled awards season, and anticipation is at an all-time low. The Academy\u2019s plan to lure viewers by handing out a bunch of awards off-screen has been widely criticised by the film-making community. Simply put, things are getting desperate.\nBut we\u2019ve all thrown parties without knowing whether anyone will actually turn up, and the Oscars are currently doing the most sensible thing possible: they\u2019re focusing on the catering.\nA press release announced that the menu at this year\u2019s Governors Ball \u2013 essentially, the official afterparty that everyone pops into before heading on to other, better afterparties \u2013 will be a collaboration between Wolfgang Puck and the \u201cBronx-based culinary collective\u201d Ghetto Gastro. As the release put it: \u201cMerging food, fashion, music, art and design, Ghetto Gastro\u2019s work masterfully blends influences from the African diaspora, global south ingredients and hip-hop to create offerings that address race, identity and economic empowerment.\u201d\nNot to be down on the sentiment, but a large proportion of the Governors Ball attendees will be millionaires who just lost out on an award in front of a global audience. Is there a demographic less likely to appreciate a mixed-media food selection designed to address identity and economic empowerment?\nBut it\u2019s OK, because if Ghetto Gastro doesn\u2019t float everyone\u2019s boat, guests can eat the food prepared by Wolfgang Puck\u2019s team, which is said to include \u201cspicy tuna cones\u201d and \u201csmoked salmon Oscars\u201d. Not everyone at the Governors Ball can win an Oscar, but they can eat a slice of fish that looks a bit like an Oscar.\nYou can\u2019t help feeling, though, that none of these offerings will go down particularly well. You don\u2019t have to be an Academy Awards historian to know that the best part of any Oscar night is when someone gets the burgers out. This tends to happen at the Vanity Fair party and, when it does, it\u2019s like feeding time at the zoo.\nAfter all, what are the Oscars if not the culmination of a season during which hundreds of already thin people have denied themselves calories in an effort to squeeze into uncomfortably tight outfits? It sounds hellish. When Ellen DeGeneres hosted in 2014, there was a segment where pizzas were brought to the ceremony with great procession, and the cries of hungry delight from the assembled A-listers was chilling. So imagine how furiously the same people would fall on a plate of hamburgers when the cameras stop rolling. They deserve it, too. Those burgers are the real award.\nMy advice for next year\u2019s awards is to forget about Wolfgang Puck and Ghetto Gastro. Leave the salmon Oscars at home. Instead, let\u2019s replace them with an all-you-can-eat carb station. Bread rolls fired out of T-shirt cannons. Troughs packed to the brim with mashed potatoes. A firehose that shoots a jet of hot rice pudding directly into the face of anyone who walks into the room. This is what Hollywood wants. This is what Hollywood needs. This, with no exaggeration, is the only thing that can save the Oscars.",

        "content": "Crackdown on sweeping eco-friendly claims hoped to boost faith in genuine sustainable products\nConsumers are being duped into paying a premium for fashion products that make grand claims about their environmental credentials but have no evidence to back them up, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said as it prepares to name and shame high street clothing companies.\nEntire lines of clothing are being labelled \u201csustainable\u201d and \u201ceco-friendly\u201d, without the company having proof that the whole process \u2013 from manufacture to delivery, packaging and sale \u2013 is good for the environment, according to the CMA.\nThe CMA is investigating claims by Britain\u2019s fashion sector and will shortly have a list of the worst offenders. It is investigating sector by sector, with the packaged food industry and supermarkets likely to be next.\nIt is estimated that UK consumers spend \u00a354bn annually on clothing and footwear, and this is expected to continue growing in the coming years. According to some estimates, fashion is responsible for between 2% and 8% of global carbon emissions, as well as causing waste and pollution. About 300,000 tonnes of used clothes are burned or buried in landfill each year in the UK.\nBut buyers trying to do the right thing by buying sustainable products are being bamboozled by sweeping claims, according to the watchdog, resulting in a loss of trust which could stop the UK reaching its climate commitments.\nCecilia Parker Aranha, the CMA\u2019s director of consumer protection, said: \u201cAccording to our research, something like 60% of people had said they were either likely to or fairly likely to be willing to pay more for products, and I think it was up to about 9% more [money] for products that were environmentally friendly. My impression is that people are willing to pay a premium.\u201d\nThis means companies have been quick to slap green claims on their products, sometimes without going to much effort to make the items more sustainable.\n\u201cWe have taken the view that the growing consumer demand for green products and their willingness to pay for those green products has increased the incentive for businesses to be seen to be green, whether or not they actually are green,\u201d Parker Aranha explained.\nClaims being investigated by the CMA include unfair comparisons that individual items of clothing are \u201cbetter for the environment\u201d without qualifying how; claims about the use of recycled materials in new clothing; and entire ranges of clothing within stores being branded as \u201csustainable\u201d.\nParker Aranha said: \u201cI was really sceptical about anybody that\u2019s making a sweeping claim that a product is \u2018eco\u2019 or \u2018sustainable\u2019 because the business would be having to really show that every element of the product from production through to disposal will be good for the environment, not harmful to the environment. The other thing I would watch is if they say they\u2019re \u2018made with recycled fibres\u2019. They are often only made with 16% to 20% recycled fibres.\n\u201cFor those very generic general claims, most businesses won\u2019t be in a position to prove that the product is good for the environment every step of the way. If you use the word \u2018sustainable\u2019, I think that really means that you have to be sustainable throughout the whole lifecycle.\u201d\nThe CMA will name the companies it considers to be the worst offenders, as an example to the rest of the industry, and ask them to make changes. If they do not make changes to their advertising, they could be taken to court.\nInvestigators pointed out that its ticket-touting crackdown led to a legal case against the website Viagogo, which then made changes to how it operated. It said that greenwashing fashion companies could face similar consequences.\n\u201cIf businesses don\u2019t voluntarily undertake those changes, then we have the option to take them to court to force them to do that,\u201d Parker Aranha said.\nThis area is still relatively un-investigated, with companies free to call themselves \u201ceco\u201d and face little scrutiny.\nParker Aranha added: \u201cI think greenwashing and misleading environmental claims is not an area that a lot of regulators in the UK have looked into so far.\u201d\nThis could cause a loss of faith in sustainable products, with customers giving up on making eco-friendly choices. It could also cause companies that do make an effort to be green to face a competitive disadvantage.\n\u201cThis is a problem as a large amount of these claims are false, consumers are buying the wrong products, and the businesses [that] are doing the right thing are losing out,\u201d said Parker Aranha.\n\u201cIt could also really undermine trust. And ultimately, if you undermine trust, consumers don\u2019t believe what they\u2019re seeing on any packaging as far as green claims are concerned. And that\u2019s going to have an impact on the UK\u2019s ability to do what it needs to do to tackle climate change and the other sustainability challenges that we face.\u201d\nEco\nSome ranges are named \u201ceco\u201d or have \u201ceco\u201d in the name, but it would be very difficult to prove whether the entire supply chain and manufacturing process was eco-friendly.\nSustainable \u2013 labelling of an entire range\nCertain components of a product can legitimately be called \u201csustainable\u201d \u2013 but check if there is a qualification. For example, it might be made using a non-toxic process, but if an entire range or garment is labelled \u201csustainable\u201d, this raises a red flag because it is a sweeping statement.\nMade with organic or recycled cotton\nMany clothing lines say they are made with recycled or organic materials when these fibers only make up a small percentage of the fabric.\nUnfair comparisons\nIf something is labelled \u201cgreener\u201d or \u201cmore eco-friendly\u201d but does not indicate what this comparison is with, it could be a greenwashing claim.",

        "content": "Increase in infections to estimated one in 25 people follows similar trend in Scotland\nOne in 25 people in England had Covid last week, figures show, causing a rise in the rates of hospital admissions.\nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs from randomly selected households, reveal an estimated 2,073,900 people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 5 March, equating to 3.8% of the population or about one in 25 people. The week before, the figure was about one in 30.\nIn Scotland, the latest ONS figures suggest about one in 18 had Covid in the most recent week \u2013 continuing a rise in prevalence \u2013 while in Northern Ireland and Wales it was one in 13 and one in 30 respectively, suggesting infection levels are increasing in all countries in the UK.\nIn both England and Scotland the number of Covid patients in hospital is also increasing: in Scotland the number reached 1,636 on Thursday, surpassing the high of 1,571 on 19 January.\nProf John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said there were likely to be a number of factors behind the rise in infections. These included the relaxation of Covid measures, such as the legal requirement to self-isolate, and the slow shift in people\u2019s behaviour, such as increased socialisation and reduced mask-wearing, he said.\nThe BA.2 Omicron variant, which appears to be more transmissible than the earlier BA.1 Omicron variant and is rising across the UK, waning immunity and even the impact of half-term, are also likely playing a role, he said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very hard to say what is the dominant factor \u2026 This might be just a blip or it might herald something which is much larger,\u201d he said, adding that it was unclear how big the coming wave might be.\nThe ONS data also suggests differences in infection levels by age, with a rise in infection levels in those aged 25 years and over in the most recent week. However, while infection levels were highest in those aged two years old to school year 6, at 4.2%, it was 3.3% in those aged 70 and over \u2013 the highest since the survey began in 2020.\n\u201cToday\u2019s data shows an increase in Covid-19 infections across the whole of the UK, with a continued rise of BA.2 Omicron cases,\u201d said Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey. \u201cIt is too early to say whether these increases have been driven by the easing of restrictions, recent school holidays or something else, but we will continue to carefully monitor the latest data.\u201d\nThe figures came after findings from the React-1 study, led by Imperial College London, suggested cases of Covid were rising in older people.\nWhile Edmunds said the current situation was not keeping him up at night, one concern was that people\u2019s behaviour remained very different from before the pandemic.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go in terms of relaxing and going back to normal behaviour. And that will just, I think, continually fuel further cases over the coming months,\u201d he said, adding another problem that would increase over time was waning immunity.\nThe upshot, he said, was that it was likely there would be a lengthy period of high prevalence, similar to that which occurred last autumn. \u201c[That resulted] in a constant stream of people going into a hospital and unfortunately a constant stream of people dying,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in for something similar over the next few months. It won\u2019t be as severe because more people have been vaccinated, and this is a less severe strain. Nevertheless, it is that kind of pattern, and I think what we are seeing now is the start of it.\u201d\nWhile Edmunds welcomed the forthcoming second booster programme, aimed at those over 75 or people who were vulnerable, he said there needed to be serious consideration as to whether, and to what point, it should be expanded further.\n\u201cThere is a point at which you don\u2019t react to every small increase in incidence with another vaccination programme. They are phenomenally expensive,\u201d he said.\nBut Edmunds said public health advice, including increasing ventilation, hand-washing and other measures remained relevant. \u201cIf you are ill, and if you do have symptoms that are likely to be Covid, stay at home for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said.",

This is not the time for delays. I hope other people will do the same.\u201d\nThe 69-year-old said he will meet the cost of bringing the refugees to the UK and paying for their accommodation for up to six months.\nOn Friday, Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said the number of Ukrainian refugees had exceeded 2.5 million since the invasion began on 24 February.\nThe number of refugees from Ukraine \u2014 tragically \u2014 has reached today 2.5 million.We also estimate that about two million people are displaced inside Ukraine. Millions forced to leave their homes by this senseless war.\nEarlier this week, ministers began considering a climbdown to allow Ukrainians with temporary visas to bring relatives to the UK after Ukraine\u2019s ambassador called for an easing of restrictions.\nWhile Morgan\u2019s initiative is being paid for through his foundation, which was set up in 2001, he said it does not have the facilities to handle the logistics of the relocation programme. Staff at the foundation, which distributed almost \u00a326m to charities struggling with the pandemic last year, have contacted a number of MPs to ask for clarity on the sponsorship process.\nMorgan, whose fortune is estimated at close to \u00a31bn, retired as chairman of Redrow, which has a stock market value of nearly \u00a32bn, in 2019.\nThe Liverpudlian received an OBE for services to the construction industry in 2012.

We live here.\u201d\nDespite heavy losses of personnel and equipment in the third week of Russia\u2019s brutal assault on Ukraine \u2013 in which cities have been placed under siege and subjected to bombardment \u2013 Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces were pushing ahead with their campaign.\nThe Russian defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Russia used high-precision long-range weapons on Friday to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk \u201cout of action\u201d.\nThe airstrike on the Lutsk military airfield early on Friday left two members of the Ukrainian forces dead and six people wounded, according to the head of the surrounding Volyn region, Yuriy Pohulyayko.\nImages of the aftermath showed what appeared to be a massive explosion that set fire to what looked like fuel storage tanks and cratered the runway.\nLutsk residents said they were woken at 6.45am on Friday when four Russian rockets hit the city\u2019s military aerodrome.\nOne said: \u201cWe live 2km away. The rockets woke us up. We had been living in Kharkiv and left the city last week. The Russians bombard Kharkiv 100 times a day. Compared to that, this wasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d\nThe strikes also targeted an airport near Ivano-Frankivsk, where residents were ordered to shelters after an air raid alert, the mayor, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said.\nThree Russian airstrikes also hit the eastern industrial city of Dnipro early on Friday, killing at least one person, according to the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser, Anton Heraschenko. They hit an area near a chemical plant, leaving a shoe factory completely destroyed, and breaking the windows on a nearby kindergarten.\nThe new wave of strikes came as clear skies on Friday made Russian air operations easier.\nDespite claiming to have \u201cneutralised\u201d the Ukrainian air forces and air defences in the first few days of the war, in the last week Russia has hit Ukrainian airforce sites a number of times, including striking an airfield in Vinnytsia \u2013 the city that is the headquarters of the Ukrainian airforce \u2013 with eight cruise missiles in a single attack.\nThe focus on Ukraine\u2019s air assets appears to be part of a continuing effort by Russia to gain uncontested control of the air, which it has so far failed to achieve, but which would allow more air support to forces on the ground.\nThe latest strikes came amid contradictory assessments of Russian progress around Kyiv, with the Ukraine general staff saying the Russian advance had been halted and the Pentagon suggesting that it had moved forward about 3 miles in the north-west.\nThe satellite photos of Russian concentrations around Kyiv, meanwhile, appeared to show a massive convoy previously detected outside the Ukrainian capital had fanned out into towns and forests near the city with artillery pieces raised for firing, in another potentially ominous movement.\nA US defence official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russian forces moving toward Kyiv had advanced about 3 miles (5km) in the past 24 hours, with some elements as close as about nine miles from the city.\nIt appeared the convoy forces were moving west around the city, trying to encircle it to the south, according to Jack Watling, a research fellow at British defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute.\n\u201cThey\u2019re about halfway around now, to be able to close off on the south,\u201d he told BBC radio. He added they were likely preparing for a \u201csiege rather than assault\u201d on Kyiv because of continuing low morale and logistical problems.\nWhile a move to a more static approach of shelling Kyiv from outside might be less costly for Russian forces in the first instance, it is not without risk.\nThe Ukrainian use of Turkish-supplied combat drones has been effective against Russian vehicles, and more static positions would be vulnerable to other Ukrainian aircraft, perhaps explaining the recent stepped up effort to knock Ukrainian airfields.",

        "content": "The England hooker has had a rollercoaster couple of years but cannot wait to face some good friends at Twickenham on Saturday\nEveryone is in agreement that a hugely significant fixture awaits the rugby men of England and Ireland. Inside the two dressing rooms, though, intense personal motivation is also part of the emotional mix. Sometimes it can be overlooked just how much pain and soul searching has to be endured before players finally run out into Twickenham\u2019s concrete vastness and stand proudly for the anthems.\nFor at least one Englishman, it is only then that the madness makes sense. All those sacrifices \u2013 the injuries, the rehab, the relentless grind of professional sport \u2013 finally become worth it from Jamie George\u2019s perspective. \u201cA lot of the time during the week you go through a lot of hardship. It isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone sees you lining up for the anthems but not always the amount you need to go through to get there.\u201d\nAnd in that split second, as he gazes up at the evening sky and thinks of his family and friends, George will give grateful thanks that, somehow, he is still standing there. As recently as last September the Saracens and England hooker feared he had played his last Six Nations game, having been dropped from the squad as a consequence of England\u2019s 32-18 loss to Ireland in Dublin a year ago. There is a wry smile now but at the time the 31-year-old felt it could be game over: \u201cGenuinely when I was left out the thought that went through my head was: \u2018Wow, I might never get another chance to sing the anthem.\u2019 I certainly won\u2019t ever take it for granted again.\u201d\nWho knows, maybe that was Jones\u2019s masterplan all along? If so, it was brutal man management and the rejection, in the case of George and others, cut deep. \u201cThat was a real low point for me. Eddie suggesting I\u2019d lost that fire in the belly \u2026 those were the words he used.\u201d Despite being immediately recalled to the squad inside 24 hours, courtesy of an injury to Exeter\u2019s Luke Cowan-Dickie, the jolt was considerable. \u201cFor me it was almost fight or flight. I had to show how much I cared. I was disappointed that Eddie saw \u2013 or thought he saw \u2013 that I was not as fired up as he\u2019d seen before. I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with him but it gave me that kick to drive on and go and show him that I was.\u201d\nThe wild, lurching extremes of professional rugby, George believes, are not always fully appreciated by outsiders. Just over two years ago he was starting a World Cup final and representing the domestic champions. A few short months later he was plying his trade in the Championship following Saracens\u2019 enforced relegation and contemplating international oblivion. Even after his autumn reprieve, he was injured against Australia and sidelined for 10 weeks, making his two tries against Italy in Rome all the sweeter.\nUp, down, up, down. Now, suddenly, here he is again as vice-captain of England, about to play his 65th red rose Test on Saturday courtesy of another Cowan-Dickie injury. Even for a well-adjusted individual with an expanding rehabilitation and physiotherapy business in Hertfordshire it has been a tricky time. \u201cIt has been a bit crazy, to be honest,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cThere\u2019ve been some incredible highs and some pretty serious lows. It\u2019s been a helluva ride.\u201d\nLast summer\u2019s British & Irish Lions expedition was also bittersweet: after being asked to captain the touring side against the Sharks in June he was subsequently overlooked for the Tests. Four years previously he started all three in the drawn series against the All Blacks. \u201cGoing from the high of captaining the Lions to the low of not being selected in the Tests in two weeks is pretty hard to get your head around,\u201d he says.\nA phlegmatic streak has been a prerequisite from his earliest Test days. For all his lineout accuracy, scrummaging strength and bustling ball-carrying, Dylan Hartley\u2019s presence ensured George\u2019s first 19 caps for England were earned as a replacement. His father, Ian, sat on England\u2019s bench nine times without winning a cap so there was a degree of dark humour involved. But it was still striking to see him start for the Lions before Jones had handed him the white No 2 jersey.\nNow it almost feels as if he has come full circle, required to prove his pedigree all over again. Much the same applies to Jones\u2019s England. Lose badly to Ireland and France, and another bottom-half championship finish beckons. And given Jones\u2019s response to last year\u2019s defeat in Dublin \u2013 by the time George appeared as a second-half replacement his side were 20-6 down \u2013 who knows what the fallout might be if history repeats itself?\nComplicating things further is that George is great mates \u2013 \u201cI count a lot of those guys as close friends\u201d \u2013with, among others, Johnny Sexton and Peter O\u2019Mahony from the 2017 Lions tour. Pointedly ignoring them in the tunnel is not his style \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not that sort of bloke\u201d \u2013 but he also knows Sexton and O\u2019Mahony well enough to know how they will be feeling.\n\u201cYou go in with perceptions of people having played against them and Johnny\u2019s a great example,\u201d George says. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously one of the best fly-halves to play the game and he\u2019s very serious in the way he drives the standards of his team. Then you get him off the field and he\u2019ll have a laugh and loves a beer. I really enjoy his company.\u201d And O\u2019Mahony? \u201cPete is very serious and grumpy on the field \u2013 and very serious and grumpy off it. But he\u2019s another close mate so I\u2019m allowed to say that.\u201d\nWhat every English squad member would really love, of course, is a rerun of the crisp, commanding 32-20 win Jones\u2019s side inflicted on Ireland in Dublin in 2019. A positive Covid test will prevent the forwards coach, Richard Cockerill, from attending the game but the messages urging the home team to up their physical intensity and their set-piece accuracy remain unchanged. \u201cUltimately whenever you play Ireland it\u2019s going to come down to a physicality battle,\u201d says George. \u201cThat was something we were disappointed with in Dublin last year. If you look at the template of how you want to play against them you\u2019d look at that first game. We really took the game to them. But at the same time we\u2019re a different team to what we were; we want to give them something they haven\u2019t seen before. We\u2019re aware it needs to be a full, relentless 80-minute performance.\u201d\nPowering it all, in addition, will be a rising sense of collective grievance \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you beat Wales at home but suddenly you don\u2019t beat them by enough\u201d \u2013 and a last-minute blast of profound individual desire. \u201cI always get very emotional during the anthems,\u201d says George.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be English, proud to be part of the team and proud to be representing my family. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about for me.\u201d Ireland are daunting opponents but England do not plan to lie down meekly.",

        "content": "Reclaim These Streets welcomes judges\u2019 decision as \u2018a victory for women\u2019 and calls for Met reform\nThe Metropolitan police breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in the way they handled the planned event, high court judges have ruled, in a decision hailed as a \u201cvictory for women\u201d.\nReclaim These Streets (RTS) proposed a socially distanced vigil for the 33-year-old, who was murdered by a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens, near to where she went missing in Clapham, south London, in March last year.\nFour women who founded RTS and planned the vigil brought a legal challenge against the force over its handling of the event, which was also intended to be a protest about violence against women.\nThey withdrew from organising the vigil after being told by the force they would face fines of \u00a310,000 each and possible prosecution if the event went ahead, and a spontaneous vigil and protest took place instead.\nAt a two-day hearing in January, Jessica Leigh, Anna Birley, Henna Shah and Jamie Klingler argued that decisions made by the force in advance of the planned vigil amounted to a breach of their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and say the force did not assess the potential risk to public health.\nIn a judgment handed down on Friday, Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate ruled in favour of RTS, finding that the Met\u2019s decisions in the run-up to the event were \u201cnot in accordance with the law\u201d.\nIn a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice on behalf of the four women who organised the vigil, their solicitor Theodora Middleton said: \u201cToday\u2019s judgment is a victory for women. Last March, women\u2019s voices were silenced. Today\u2019s judgment conclusively shows that the police were wrong to silence us.\u201d\nThe Reclaim These Streets co-founder Jamie Klingler said the ruling represented \u201cabsolute vindication\u201d.\n\u201cEvery step of the way there was just condescension and disrespect and [the police] were telling us their hands were tied,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope that the new commissioner is a visionary who really prioritises getting rid of the systemic racism, sexism and homophobia in the force.\u201d\nPatsy Stevenson, who was arrested at an impromptu vigil for Everard in the days after her murder, described the ruling as a \u201chuge win\u201d, adding: \u201cWomen are fighting back now.\u201d\nStevenson, who is taking legal action against the force over her arrest, said: \u201cAs soon as I found out, I just burst into tears. It\u2019s a huge win and it just shows we should have been able to do it and that the police were in the wrong. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying the whole time but no one listened or understood.\u201d\nIn a summary of the ruling, Lord Justice Warby said: \u201cNone of the [force\u2019s] decisions was in accordance with the law; the evidence showed that the [force] failed to perform its legal duty to consider whether the claimants might have a reasonable excuse for holding the gathering, or to conduct the fact-specific proportionality assessment required in order to perform that duty.\u201d\nThe Met defended the claim brought by RTS and argued there was no exception for protest in the coronavirus rules at the time, and that it had \u201cno obligation\u201d to assess the public health risk.\nIn a statement after the ruling the Met said it was \u201cconsidering very carefully\u201d whether it should appeal.\nThe Met assistant commissioner Louisa Rolfe said: \u201cThe Met is mindful that this judgment has potential implications in other circumstances for how a proportionality assessment is to be carried out when considering enforcement action. This may apply beyond policing the pandemic. Even in the context of the regulations that kept us safe during the pandemic, this may have important consequences.\n\u201cThe Met unreservedly endorses the principle that fundamental freedoms, such as those exercised by the claimants in this case, may only be restricted where it is necessary and proportionate for a lawful purpose. Consideration of an appeal is in no way indicative that the Met do not consider such protections to be of the utmost importance. It is, however, incumbent on the Met to ensure that this judgment does not unduly inhibit its ability, and that of police forces across the country, to effectively balance competing rights in a way that is operationally deliverable.\u201d",

        "content": "Britain gets it badly wrong; and the kids think maybe I learned to read from a witch or a shaman\nIt was the week the 14-year-olds chose their GCSEs, and therefore a big growth-mindset week for me, one in which I was happy to discover a whole new vista of my own ignorance and wrong-headedness. Goodbye, then, all those things I used to know. Cool people don\u2019t do history any more, it\u2019s just out-of-date politics. But don\u2019t be fooled, they don\u2019t do politics either, that isn\u2019t a thing. Now they do geography. You\u2019ll notice not that much has changed; we had to choose between history and geography in 1989, round about the year GCSEs were invented. Nor have the contours of the Earth, or mysterious centrality of the oxbow lake, changed all that much. Sometimes when I attempt to share my experience, I see a trace of something like a tactfully masked surprise pass over their faces. God knows, I don\u2019t want to interrogate, so I\u2019m guessing here: but I think they\u2019re surprised that school existed when I was a kid. I think they think I learned to read from maybe a local witch or shaman and then moved directly from there to whatever it is I do.\nAnyway, some things have changed: you can now choose computer science, but only if you don\u2019t want to do Italian; and PE is a potential qualification rather than a time-filling exercise in sadism; and you must never say \u201cbiology, chemistry and physics\u201d, only \u201ctriple science\u201d, like it\u2019s an ice-cream or an espresso. But most importantly, at some point over the intervening 30 or so years, it has become none of your parent\u2019s business what you do. Their opinions, should they choose to share them, should be greeted by you doing the exact opposite of that, pour encourager les autres. So I\u2019m trying a new strategy. \u201cPah, exams, what do you want to do those for? You should stick it to the man!\u201d I can let you know how that panned out, two and a half years from now.\nIt was International Women\u2019s Day and I was due to chair a panel: Shaista Aziz, journalist and campaigner, one of The Three Hijabis who finally, after decades, enabled those of us who don\u2019t follow football to be authentically interested in the Euros last year; Kate Hudson from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; the political economist Yuliya Yurchenko; Aliona Lyasheva from the sociology faculty at the University of Kyiv; and Inna Berezkina, from Russia\u2019s School of Civic Education. Trying to map a feminist discussion at a time like this rams home the reality of the situation. Talking about violence against women when rape is being used as an act of war, discussing feminist peace movements through the ages when the terror of nuclear weapons has come roaring back as if it never went away, reflecting on the reality of feminist civic organising in authoritarian regimes, and how misogyny and racism act as organising principles for right-wing movements \u2013 these conversations have never been more devastating or necessary than this year. War tends to centre the masculine perspective. Women-and-children becomes a compound noun, an umbrella term for the vulnerable, the collateral, the peripheral.\nThen the event began \u2013 it was online of course. I could join it, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to become a speaker without kicking someone else off. Who to eject: the woman who\u2019d mobilised 3 million feminists to join the dots between misogyny and racism, or the woman whose city was under heavy artillery fire from a man who would, the next day, bomb a maternity hospital? It was not a bad metaphor for the underlying sense that maybe my perspective, living this life where feminism contains no real risk besides arguing with other feminists, wasn\u2019t the most relevant for 2022. So I sat it out in the audience, and the wonderful campaigner Alena Ivanova chaired instead.\nRefugees stream out of Ukraine, showing astonishing fortitude and endurance, and are met with equally awe-inspiring kindness by the citizens of the rest of Europe, who understand on a human level what geopolitics can\u2019t bring itself to voice: that this could be any one of us. The UK has been unique in its response; finally, there\u2019s some British exceptionalism one could actually stand behind. We are exceptionally bad at this. While other nations waive their visa requirements, ours are crazy: biometric tests that refugees can only take at specific centres; appointments nobody can get till April; visa centres that won\u2019t open their doors, as queues of people wait outside in freezing temperatures; others that keep their location secret, lest they accidentally help anyone. This inhumanity will be a lasting stain on the nation, and it is, at this point, impossible to tell whether it\u2019s deliberate, motivated by the home secretary\u2019s reluctance to offer sanctuary to anyone, or accidental, driven by incompetence.\nIn all likelihood, there will be some frantic governmental scrambling to save face. The stringency of the entry requirements is bound to be relaxed, as it slowly dawns on Priti Patel that, even if she were asking for the right documents, her government doesn\u2019t have the capacity to check them. By that point, hundreds of thousands of desperate people will have been through needless hardship and turmoil and bureaucratic hell, to satisfy rules that were never necessary and have shamed us all.\nThe Kardashians have signed a reported nine-figure deal with Hulu for their new reality show, because, in the words of Kris Jenner, \u201cwell, money always matters\u201d. Perhaps it was one of terms of the deal, that they spark a controversy from day one, or maybe just because you don\u2019t get to be nine-figure-famous without a certain facility for enraging people, but Kim Kardashian really pulled it out of the hat. \u201cI have the best advice for women in business,\u201d she said. \u201cGet your fucking ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.\u201d\nThere followed an outraged response on social media, including some from people who claimed to have worked for the Kardashians on such low wages that they\u2019d occasionally had to call in sick, because they couldn\u2019t afford the trip to the office.\nIn fact, you hear this complaint a lot, even if you don\u2019t happen to know any Instagram billionaires. Why don\u2019t young people want to come back to the office? Why won\u2019t they stay past 6pm? What happened to their work ethic? I\u2019ve heard people analyse it in the wildest ways: it\u2019s because their student debt overhang has completely upended their comprehension of money and value; or it\u2019s because, what\u2019s the point of saving, when you\u2019ll never be able to afford a house?; or it\u2019s because they\u2019re all polyamorous now, and \u2013 absent the ups and downs of a stable relationship \u2013 they\u2019ve never learned what it means to have to do something you don\u2019t want to do.\nThe Kardashian row indicated to me that maybe it\u2019s a little bit simpler. If you serially underpay people, that doesn\u2019t seem to motivate them very much. But maybe I\u2019m wrong.\nOscar nominees have a lunch ahead of the ceremony, who knows why, perhaps to practise their gracious-in-defeat faces. It\u2019s actually not a bad idea, to sit next to the rival you hate the most and smile beatifically at them, just to get everyone used to it.\nIf you, lowly punter, should ever feel at all envious of their charmed lives, I suggest you take a look at the menu: chickpea panisse with quinoa salad and pine nut picada. If you\u2019re wondering what a panisse is, think of a chip, then make it of something other than a potato, and there you have it. A picada, meanwhile, is an aromatic sauce. Naturally, you\u2019ll have heard of a sauce made of pine nuts before \u2013 pesto, of course, which is not really healthier than ketchup, but much greener, so more middle-class. Although history doesn\u2019t relate the colour of the picada, we can safely assume that this lunch was basically ketchup and chips, with some quinoa on the side, functioning as a modern take on the lettuce in a burger, which is to say, the limp item that nobody eats.\nYou have to feel for the modern Hollywood star; back in the day, the women were expected to be rake thin and were constantly eating watermelon, while the men sometimes had to be beefy, but could generally look however they liked (moreover, whatever age they liked). Now, none of them can admit to being on a diet, which would feel very 20th century, but nor can they admit to liking any unfashionable food, which is to say, all food. Yet whatever it is, it has to look like a luxury item, in order to generate the necessary wonderment from a watching crowd. So some poor schmuck ends up having to fashion a chip-a-like from a chickpea.\nThe week digested: the Home Office is not where the heart is.",

Officially known as the Parental Rights in Education bill, it seeks to ban teaching of sexual identity and gender orientation in early-grade education as well as in \u201ca manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\u201d. The wording of the latter has been attacked as so vague that it may effectively enable parents to prevent discussion of the topics at any age. The bill is currently awaiting a signature from state governor Ron DeSantis.\nThe letter came in response to a company memo sent by Disney CEO Bob Chapek on Monday after Disney failed to make a public statement in opposition to the bill, and revelations that every politician who sponsored the bill had received donations from Disney. Chapek defended the lack of opposition to the bill, saying: \u201cCorporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds \u2026 they can be counterproductive and undermine more effective ways to achieve change.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe the best way for our company to bring about lasting change is through the inspiring content we produce, the welcoming culture we create, and the diverse community organisations we support.\u201d\nPointing out that Disney has already stopped commercial activities in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and threatened to boycott the state of Georgia over its planned Religious Liberties bill in 2016, the Pixar employees group says the company\u2019s claims \u201cring hollow\u201d.\nChapek, who became CEO of Disney in 2020 after Robert Iger stepped down, is thought to want to step back from the kind of advocacy that flourished under Iger, with the Hollywood Reporter suggesting that Chapek is \u201cconcerned that Disney might be viewed as too liberal\u201d.\nDisney has been contacted for a response.",

Two of the officers investigated were promoted, while nine were left to continue serving.\nThe Met leadership\u2019s handling of the murder of Everard in March 2021 by a serving Met officer also caused consternation in City Hall and government.\nAfter her killer was sentenced to a whole-life term in September 2021, the Met leadership was expected to show it understood those concerns. Instead, it was mocked after saying that women who were worried about an officer approaching them could wave down a bus.\nJudges have now ruled that the Met breached the rights of the organisers of a vigil for Everard with its handling of the planned event.\nThe leaders of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets withdrew from organising the vigil after being told by the force they would face fines of \u00a310,000 each and possible prosecution if the event went ahead.\nBut in its place, a spontaneous vigil and protest took place that culminated in scenes of women being dragged off by male police officers that caused outrage across the political spectrum.\nThe ruling is an embarrassment for the government, particularly the home secretary, Priti Patel, who had made it clear to police that a ban on gatherings had to be enforced.\nAfter the ruling, one of the founders of Reclaim These Streets, Jamie Klingler, said that had the Met cooperated with the group, an organised vigil would have involved dozens of stewards who could communicate with the police.\n\u201cIt would have been a quiet moment of silence and then we would have gone home,\u201d she said.\nKlingler said the Met\u2019s approach \u201clit a match\u201d. She has also warned the Met that any attempt to appeal against the decision would \u201cfurther erode women\u2019s trust in the force\u201d.\nBut Scotland Yard has said it is considering an appeal, arguing that the judgment has \u201cpotential implications in other circumstances for how a proportionality assessment is to be carried out when considering enforcement action\u201d.\nThe force said these implications may apply beyond policing the pandemic. Even in the context of regulations that kept people safe during the pandemic, this may have important consequences.\nIn a statement released after the ruling, the Met quoted the high court judges, adding that it was incumbent on the force to \u201censure that this judgment does not unduly inhibit its ability, and that of police forces across the country, to effectively balance competing rights in a way that is operationally deliverable\u201d.\nBut with such pressure on the force to move on from the terrible damage to its reputation in recent months, it will be paying close attention to the warning issued by Reclaim These Streets that to appeal would be to damage relations with women further.",

        "content": "Ian Smith\u2019s moving tribute to the late Colin Cowdrey is a gentle reminder of the abiding link between the stumps and the stage\nCricket and theatre have long been intimate bedfellows. Stroll round Lord\u2019s on a Test match day and you meet more actors than at an Equity AGM. Playwrights from Beckett and Pinter to Rattigan and Hare have been drawn to the game for obvious reasons: that cricket, like drama, is a formalised ritual pulsating with subtext. That is palpably true of the latest cricket play, I Don\u2019t Think We\u2019ve Met, written by Ian Smith, an academic and ex-captain of Pinter\u2019s team, The Gaieties. It was given a one-off performance this week at a London dinner emcee\u2019d by Graham Gooch: an extraordinary event that was about a lot more than the game itself.\nSmith\u2019s subject is the great cricketer Colin Cowdrey, who, as a batsman, was a model of elegance: in my favourite cricket book, Australia 55, Alan Ross wrote of the young Cowdrey that \u201che placed and drove the ball to the on with a distribution of balance that would have delighted Michelangelo\u201d. But Smith\u2019s starting point is the way Cowdrey, in his early forties, was summoned at short notice to join an England team plagued by injuries on the Australia tour of 1974. This triggers Cowdrey\u2019s reminiscences of his whole career, including his first tour of Australia under his admired captain Len Hutton, and the torrid time he endured in the West Indies in 1959-60 and 1963 facing the fast bowling of Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith.\n\u201cWhat do they of cricket know who only cricket know?\u201d CLR James famously asked, and Smith\u2019s play inevitably becomes about something more than Cowdrey\u2019s heroics at the crease. I see it as a celebration of a chivalric courtesy rapidly becoming outmoded in an age of commercial opportunism. In one of the key scenes, Cowdrey is invited by the England captain, Tony Greig, to join a breakaway Players\u2019 Association that will vastly increase the earning power of cricketers. Rejecting Greig\u2019s blandishments, Cowdrey quietly replies: \u201cI\u2019ve always played for more than what I\u2019m paid.\u201d On his return home in 1975, Cowdrey is dismayed to learn that his friend Ted Heath is being replaced as leader of the Conservative party by Margaret Thatcher, which will eventually lead to an even more profound elevation of the profit-motive.\nYou could argue that the comfortably-off Cowdrey didn\u2019t have to worry about money. But the play is really about the public virtue, and the professional cost, of Cowdrey\u2019s innate good manners. What makes the play moving is that the role of Colin Cowdrey is played by his son, Chris. Although he regularly hosts public events, Chris has no acting experience but seems to have inherited the familial modesty: he told me that people constantly tell him that he resembles his father \u2013 except when he\u2019s playing cricket. Ian Smith skilfully voices a variety of characters, including Tony Greig, Peter May and John Arlott, and Stephanie Tripp both plays Mrs Cowdrey and provides the svelte narration.\nAs for the title of the play \u2013 which would be a perfect fit for Radio 4 \u2013 it derives from a famous encounter in Australia in 1974 when the newly arrived Cowdrey, on going out to bat, politely introduced himself to the fast bowler Jeff Thomson, by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met \u2013 I\u2019m Colin Cowdrey,\u201d to which Thomson elegantly replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to help you, fatso. Now piss off.\u201d",

The voles do not eat the bunchgrass, but were observed to manage it as a means of self-preservation, an example of \u201cecosystem engineering\u201d.\n\u201cWhen shrikes were present, the voles dramatically decreased the volume of bunchgrass,\u201d said Dirk Sanders of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the university\u2019s Penryn campus in Cornwall.\n\u201cThis led to fewer visits from shrikes, which apparently recognise cut-grass areas as poor hunting grounds. An activity like this is costly for the voles in terms of energy so cutting the grass must significantly improve their chances of survival.\u201d\nThe voles attack the bottom parts of the stem and leaves and dropped them on the ground. They also dig burrows that lead to the roots being cut.\nResearchers tested the impact of keeping the predators away by putting up nets over certain areas. With no shrikes overhead, the voles stopped cutting the bunchgrass.\nOther examples of ecosystem engineering include elephants opening up areas of African savanna and fish off the Catalan coast reducing the canopy height of seagrass, but these make areas safer for other species rather than their own.\nShrikes often perch on the branches and stems of shrubs and tall grasses to search for prey such as voles and large insects. They store their food by impaling their prey on a thorn or a stem, as if storing food on a meat hook.\n\u201cWe sometimes underestimate the ability of wild animals to react to changes in their environment,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn this case, the voles were able to change their behaviour in response to the removal of predators.\n\u201cOur findings are a reminder that species show remarkable adaptations. It also underlines that the loss of even a single species in a food web can result in unexpected changes to an entire habitat.\u201d\nThe paper is published in the journal Current Biology, entitled \u201cA rodent herbivore reduces its predation risk\u201d.",

It left the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk at 01.27 on 23 February, according to maritime data. It was due to dock at Southampton on Friday afternoon.\nGreenpeace is tracking supertankers carrying fossil fuels that have left Russia since the war began, using shipping data to monitor their movements.\nExxonMobil, which owns the refinery in Fawley where the oil on Seatribute is destined to go, denied it was Russian oil. The company said the oil was from Kazakhstan, and had been transported via the Caspian pipeline.\nThe pipeline transports the bulk of Kazakhstan\u2019s oil exports through southern Russia to the oil terminal at Novorossiysk. But about 10% of the oil that passes through the pipeline comes from oilfields in the Russian sector of the Caspian, which is blended with the Kazakh crude. The pipeline is part-owned by Russia.\nExxonMobil said in a statement: \u201cNo ExxonMobil equity crude that is transported via the Caspian pipeline en route to the US or Europe is from Russia. The Caspian pipeline delivers oil and gas from Kazakhstan and is not subject to sanctions at this time.\u201d\nSeveral tankers have left Russian oil and gas ports for the UK since 24 February, according to the Greenpeace tracker. Some have been redirected, but others appear to still be on the way to Britain.\nLast Friday \u2013 just days after Shapps announced a ban on Russian oil and gas tankers docking in UK ports \u2013 dockers refused to unload a tanker of Russian gas due to arrive at a Thames estuary port. Shapps\u2019s veto contains a loophole: it does not cover the origin of the cargo, and only applies to Russian-owned, or Russian-flagged ships.\nRosie Rogers, the head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cOur dependence on oil and gas is still fuelling Putin\u2019s war. If ministers are serious about putting a stop to that, then we need to see firmer action on blocking fossil fuel imports from Russia. We hope our tracker will be a useful tool to anyone who wants to monitor where Putin\u2019s oil and gas are turning up.\u201d\nThe UK relies on Russia for 5% of its gas imports and 8% of oil imports. Earlier this week the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, pledged to phase out the import of Russian oil by the end of the year.\nShell had to apologise last week for exploiting the conflict to buy Russian crude oil last weekend at a discounted price.\nA spokesperson for Associated British Ports said: \u201cFollowing the government\u2019s legislation barring Russian vessels from UK ports, we are working closely with colleagues in the Department for Transport and other government agencies to ensure that all vessels entering our ports are fully compliant with this law.\u201d",

He also condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called on Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops.\n\u201cAt the moment many with Russian roots are under scrutiny, including myself,\u201d Lebedev wrote. \u201cI understand the reason for this as it is inevitable when events of such magnitude occur and the world order as we have known it in recent decades suddenly gets torn up.\u201d\nJohnson was this week forced to deny he intervened to secure a peerage for Lebedev after intelligence services warned it would be a security risk, after reports in the Guardian and Sunday Times.\nLebedev, who joined the House of Lords in November 2020 as a crossbencher, said he was \u201cnot a security risk to this country, which I love\u201d and that while his father had been a KGB agent, he was \u201cnot some agent of Russia\u201d.\n\u201cBeing Russian does not automatically make one an enemy of the state, and it is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,\u201d Lebedev added.\nIt came hours after the Foreign Office imposed sanctions on a further 386 members of the Russian parliament\u2019s lower house \u2013 the Duma \u2013 taking the total number targeted so far to 400 of its 450 members.\nThe move came in response to a vote last month that recognised the independence of self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, and authorised the permanent presence of Russian military in the two regions.\nThe UK government had been under pressure to act for some time, given the EU issued sanctions against those Duma members who supported the incursion on 23 February.\nThe UK had previously vowed to punish members of the Russian parliament\u2019s upper house \u2013 the Federation Council \u2013 with similar sanctions.\nDavid Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, welcomed the move but said it should have happened weeks ago. He called for the government to \u201curgently implement\u201d other sanctions to \u201ccut Putin and his criminal cronies out of our economic system\u201d.\nLabour has called for further action, including extending sanctions to cover wealth held in the name of family members of those already targeted; removing Belarusian banks from the international Swift payment system; and imposing limits on Russians depositing money into UK bank accounts.\nLayla Moran, the foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said the UK was \u201cmoving at a snail\u2019s pace\u201d and that only 18 oligarchs had been sanctioned, meaning \u201chundreds of Putin\u2019s cronies are still getting away with it\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cEvery second wasted is another opportunity for them to take off in their private jets and flee to a safe haven. We need to sanction the lot and seize their assets now.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the UK announced sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs, including the Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abaramovich, with an estimated combined worth of \u00a315bn.\nThe other businesspeople accused of having \u201cblood on their hands\u201d were Abramovich\u2019s one-time business partner Oleg Deripaska; Putin\u2019s \u201cright-hand man\u201d Igor Sechin; and four men in the Russian president\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d: Andrey Kostin, Alexei Miller, Nikolai Tokarev and Dmitri Lebedev.",

The G7 will also seek to deny Russia the ability to borrow from leading multilateral institutions.\nStripping most favored nation status from Russia would allow the US and allies to impose higher tariffs on some imports, increasing the isolation of the Russian economy.\nIt follows days after the Biden moved to ban imports of Russian oil and gas products.\nOther measures taken include the freezing of central bank assets, limits on exports and sanctions against Russian oligarchs and their families. These financial tools have led to the Russian rouble losing 76% of its value against the US dollar over the past month, which has caused destructive inflation that could erode Putin\u2019s ability to wage a prolonged war in Ukraine.\nMost favored nation status has been a baseline for global trade, ensuring that countries within the World Trade Organization are treated similarly. Some countries in the WTO have special privileges due to their status as developing economies.\nRussia would join the ranks of Cuba and North Korea by not having MFN status from the US.\nThe revocation, however, carries mostly symbolic weight. The earlier sanctions on imports of Russian oil, gas and coal already cut off about 60% of US imports from the country, and the new import bans announced on Friday add up to only about $1bn in revenue, according to White House figures.\nRussia provided less than 1% of US vodka imports in December, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US, and less than 2% of US seafood imports by volume, according to federal statistics.",

Mexico is a free, independent, and sovereign country.\n\u201cIf we were in the situation you describe in your pamphlet, our president would not be supported by 66% of citizens,\u201d added the statement, calling MEPs the \u201csheep\u201d of the \u201creactionary coup-mongers\u201d allegedly trying to derail L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government.\nOn Friday morning L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as he is known, continued the offensive, blaming the \u201cslanderous\u201d European resolution on conservative politicians \u201cwith a colonialist mindset\u201d.\nMexico\u2019s president, who said he had helped compose the pronouncement, also appeared to play down the recent killings of Mexican journalists, two of whom were shot dead outside their homes.\n\u201cRegrettably, about 5,000 Mexicans have been murdered in the first two and a half months of this year \u2013 and of these 5,000, five were journalists,\u201d the 68-year-old nationalist told his daily morning press conference.\nAmlo\u2019s posture sparked bewilderment and anger. \u201cScandalous, demented, shameful,\u201d tweeted Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico\u2019s former ambassador to the US, comparing the government statement to the kind of invective usually associated with diplomats from authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua or Cuba.\n\u201cWhat a pitiful statement,\u201d wrote Denise Dresser, a political analyst and writer. \u201cIt belittles the government. It belittles the country.\u201d\nAmlo has repeatedly targeted journalists during the first half of his six-year term.

Many of the protesters\u2019 demands echoed those which Boric and his contemporaries had pushed in a student movement which demanded that Chile be rebuilt with the concerns of its people at the core.\nIt is a vision that Boric has vowed to achieve as president \u2013 although a divided congress will probably hamper progress.\nIn the background, representatives from every corner of Chile are drafting a new constitution to replace Gen Augusto Pinochet\u2019s 1980 charter. The new constitution will be put to a referendum later this year.\nThe new government will also have to negotiate heightened tensions between the state and indigenous Mapuche in the south, and a migration crisis in the north.\nBoric makes a point of insisting that history does not begin with his generation, but there is no denying their impact on politics.\n\u201cHe always wanted to know where those who held power came from and what they had done before,\u201d said Maira.\nIn the winter of 2011, Boric and his contemporaries paralysed Santiago with their movement demanding free, high-quality education for all, catapulting them into the national consciousness.\nA year later, Boric took the reins at the University of Chile\u2019s student union in the centre of the capital, where bright swirls of colour now adorn a building once occupied by Pinochet\u2019s feared secret police.\n\u201cHe always had something about him, and when he put himself forward for congress I joked that he might become president,\u201d remembered Sonia Moreno, 59, who has worked at the union for more than a decade.\nAs she flicked through pictures of her and a long-haired Boric on her phone, she recalled how he pushed her to finish her schooling and even helped raise money for an operation on her arm.\n\u201cI have so much faith in him because he\u2019s a warrior \u2013 he does what he says. He has a strong character and he\u2019s determined,\u201d she said.\nIn 2013, Boric was elected to Chile\u2019s congress representing Magallanes, Chile\u2019s southernmost region, vowing to change Chile from the bottom up.\nThose around him paint a picture of a voracious reader and patient negotiator, determined to collect opinions, bridge political divisions and build majorities.\nBoric has repeatedly said that as part of his ambition to decentralise Chile, he hopes to leave the presidency with less power than when he inherited it.\nHe has also been careful to signpost the changing of the times with his early choices.\nBoric reiterated his backing for Chile\u2019s constitutional process the morning after the election, and last month announced a female-majority cabinet \u2013 a symbol of the feminist Chile he is looking to build.\nHe will live downtown in Barrio Yungay, where eclectic rows of low-rise homes and graffitied facades line cobbled streets \u2013 a far cry from the outgoing president, the billionaire Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, who has a large house in Santiago\u2019s affluent north-eastern suburbs.\nThe home Boric has chosen sits between streets named Freedom and Hope.\n\u201cIf Boric is able to oversee the transition from one constitution to another, and from one generation to the next, then I would consider that a success,\u201d said Maira.\n\u201cIf he can do that, then the effects will be felt across Latin America, as he could be remembered as the leader of a new era in a region that has rarely found consensus.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Technology developed for new type of contraceptive pill could be applied to other medicines\nNew technology that allows for daily medications to instead be taken just once a week or month could transform the lives of people with conditions ranging from schizophrenia to opioid addiction, researchers have said.\nThe method has also been developed for a new type of contraceptive pill \u2013 a capsule, initially tested in pigs, that dissolves in the stomach to release a six-armed structure that delivers synthetic hormones over three weeks before falling apart and exiting the body.\nLyndra, the company that is developing the technology \u2013 backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 plans to start phase 1 trials in humans towards the end of this year. And the technology is also being applied to a host of other medications, including ivermectin for eradicating malaria.\nA once-a-week pill containing risperidone, an antipsychotic used for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is to go into clinical trials this year, the company said, and is expected to be submitted for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of next year, with approval hoped for by the end of 2024.\nTrish Hurter, the chief executive of Lyndra, said reducing the frequency for certain pills could bring health and economic benefits.\n\u201cIn schizophrenia specifically, adherence is a huge driver of outcomes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people aren\u2019t maintained on stable therapy, that\u2019s when they have relapses and hospitalisations.\u201d\nNot only does a long-lasting pill reduce the chance of missing a dose, but the technology allows for a steady concentration of a drug to be released over a given period.\n\u201cWhen you take daily pills, your drug levels are like a rollercoaster ride,\u201d said Hurter. At the start of the day, levels of the drug in the body can be very high, potentially triggering side-effects, while by the end of the day they may be too low to work.\nAnd there are other advantages to the new approach. \u201cIf you\u2019re a parent trying to help an adult child who\u2019s just been diagnosed with schizophrenia, they don\u2019t want to be treated like a kid any more and told every day, \u2018take your meds\u2019,\u201d Hurter said. \u201cHaving that interaction be less frequent just makes the whole thing more respectful, and better for the patient.\u201d\nThe company also plans to initiate a phase 1 trial for a once-a-week pill containing levomethadone, a drug used for opioid use disorder. Hurter said the approach could bring huge benefits as at present people requiring the drug must visit a clinic every day for observed dosing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for you to actually recover and get your life back on track when you\u2019re visiting a clinic every day,\u201d she said, adding that clinic resources were limited, meaning access could be difficult.\n\u201cWhen you think of the daily pill, it\u2019s highly effective provided you take it as prescribed, but hardly anybody does,\u201d said Hurter.\nLyndra is also developing the approach for rosuvastatin, a type of drug used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as a drug to control diabetes.\nBut Hurter said the technology may not work for all medications. For the approach to work, a week- or month-long dose needs to be able to fit into the capsule \u2013 which is not possible for a drug such as metformin, used to treat type 2 diabetes.\nAnd developing that technology has been far from simple. \u201cBuilding something that can stay in the stomach and last for a week is challenging from a materials design standpoint, because your stomach does like 500 to 1,000 contractions a day,\u201d Hurter said.\nProf Sh\u00f4n Lewis, a clinical professor in adult psychiatry at the University of Manchester, said it would be important to study whether the approach has the expected impact given the options already available for people with conditions such as schizophrenia, while a key question remained whether Lyndra\u2019s products would be approved in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.\n\u201cI think that the definitive trial \u2026 is going to be when we do this in real life, with the warts-and-all stuff of people\u2019s everyday lives, and does this really translate into a practical, clinical benefit?\u201d he said.\nHowever, Lewis said weekly pills could be particularly useful in the initial treatment of people relapsing in the community, allowing health professionals to give a single pill rather than having to arrange daily visits to give risperidone. \u201cThat could be a crucial step forward,\u201d he said.\nProf Cynthia Graham, an expert in sexual and reproductive health at the University of Southampton, welcomed the approach, saying while long-acting contraceptives such as hormonal implantsand intrauterine systems were very effective, not all women liked them.\n\u201cMissing pills is a massive issue still. And just the idea of taking it every day \u2026\u201d A once-a-month pill could be a positive step, she said. \u201cI think it would be a big addition, I really do.\u201d",

He described Russia\u2019s aggression as a \u201ctragic turning point\u201d.\n\u201cWe can see how our food, our energy, our defence are all issues of sovereignty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be open to the world but we want to choose our partners and not depend on anybody.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe Versailles declaration is linked to the fact that sovereignty in Europe, which might have been thought of by some as a slogan or a French fantasy, is seen by all today as crucial.\u201d\nMacron defended the decision not to offer fast-track EU membership for Ukraine, which was criticised overnight by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cThe answer is no,\u201d Macron said of the request from the war-stricken country, but he added that the EU was mobilising all its economic power to help the Ukrainian government and that the \u201cEuropean path\u201d was open.\nLithuania\u2019s president, Gitanas Naus\u0117da, said there was a \u201cflavour of disappointment\u201d to the decision for a number of EU member states but that the bloc would return to the issue.\nThe Versailles declaration was said to be the \u201cinitiation\u201d of European defence by Charles Michel, the European Council president.\nThe leaders agreed to \u201cinvest more and better in defence capabilities and innovative technologies\u201d by substantially increasing defence expenditures and through tighter cooperation and coordination of their armed forces and procurement. While EU member states spend more than three times the Russian defence budget, there are limited tie-ups and multiple overlaps in capabilities.\nThe European Commission has been given a new role to find weaknesses in Europe\u2019s defences and to advise on investment.\nMacron said Olaf Scholz\u2019s decision to set aside \u20ac100bn (\u00a384bn) for defence and Denmark\u2019s decision to put its opt-out on EU security mechanisms to a referendum showed the seriousness of the moment. The EU is also doubling its funding of military equipment destined for Ukraine to \u20ac1bn.\n\u201cAbout 10 days ago, Germany decided to make historical investments and Denmark made a historic choice deciding to ask the people if they want to come back to the European defence and security project,\u201d Macron said. \u201cEverywhere you look historic choices are being made.\u201d\nA deadline of 2027 has been set for freeing the EU from dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal. In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of its gas imports and close to 40% of the bloc\u2019s total gas consumption.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the commission would produce proposals by mid-May on how to achieve the target. In order to prepare for next winter, plans will also be made to coordinate European countries\u2019 fragmented network of gas stocks. Von der Leyen said in future underground stocks would have to be filled to at least 90% by the start of October each year.\nMacron and Scholz are due to speak to Vladimir Putin in what the French president said would be a \u201cdemanding dialogue\u201d, with the EU threatening tougher economic sanctions should Russia\u2019s president make a move against Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.\nShortly after leaders left Versailles, a new round of measures was announced by the G7, with Von der Leyen citing the failure to respect agreements over humanitarian corridors as being a motivating factor.\nRussia is being denied most-favoured-nation status for its markets under World Trade Organization rules, which will mean tariffs being imposed on its goods, and Moscow risks having its representatives thrown out of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\nAfter some resistance from Italy, the EU is also banning exports of any luxury goods to Russia, \u201cas a direct blow to the Russian elite\u201d, Von der Leyen said.\n\u201cThose who sustain Putin\u2019s war machine should no longer be able to enjoy their lavish lifestyle while bombs fall on innocent people in Ukraine,\u201d she added.\n The EU will no longer import iron and steel goods from the Russian Federation and there will be a ban on European investments across Russia\u2019s energy sector.",

Those displaced by Russian bombing should try to find jobs, he boldly suggested.\nOver in Observatorna Street in central Kyiv, a 15-minute walk from the landmark St Sophia\u2019s Cathedral, a group of Kyiv hipsters were heeding the minister\u2019s call. City hairdressers had staged a muted reopening. There were few customers for now. The street outside was mostly deserted. And you needed an appointment.\n\u201cWe only take people through word of mouth at the moment,\u201d said Yulia Stets, the salon\u2019s lead stylist and director. The business opened in October, soon after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, began amassing troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders. The salon slotted right into Kyiv\u2019s burgeoning youth scene, so hip that it was widely referred to as the \u201cnew Berlin\u201d.\nStets said she returned to work two days ago. So far they had cut the hair of seven people. Most of the staff have exited Kyiv but there were so many hairdressers without work that Stets proposed the salon become a cooperative. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting paid,\u201d she said. \u201cOur last salary is all we have. People have to find a way to start working again.\u201d\nAir-raid sirens go off every few hours in Kyiv. The city centre has not been hit for more than a week, when two Russian bombs struck the TV tower, killing several civilians including a journalist. Residents have grown used to the warnings. Most carry on with their daily tasks.\nThe war, however, is never far away. A colleague of Stets went home to Kharkiv, a city which Moscow has remorselessly pounded. The employee sent Stets pictures of three dead men who had been killed when they ventured out for water.\nStets and her only remaining hairdresser, Taras Savchenko, have converted one of the salon\u2019s rooms into a storage area. It is now being used as part of Kyiv\u2019s \u2013 and Ukraine\u2019s \u2013 ubiquitous volunteer effort. Restaurant owners have created a network of more than 100 kitchens. They are working in shifts to deliver food to hospitals, soldiers and to other key workers.\nSavchenko said he had thought about cutting hair for the first time on Thursday. Previously he had collected generators from farmers and delivered them to the frontline as a volunteer driver. \u201cAfter the war I want to get military training. I have none at the moment,\u201d he said.\nAnd what about Russia? Savchenko said he wanted to kill \u201corcs\u201d \u2013 a Ukrainian term for invading Kremlin soldiers \u2013 but wasn\u2019t yet in a position to do so. Before the war he was critical of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Now he is a fan. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing as commander in chief is totally correct.\u201d\nNon-essential shops, bars and restaurants in Kyiv have shut, along with hotels and entertainment venues. The city\u2019s Soviet-era underground network functions as a bomb shelter. There is a train every 90 minutes. Zhennya was sitting in a stationary train in Olimpiiska station, waiting to travel to his home in Teremky, in south Kyiv.\nHe said he came into town to buy some groceries. Usually an employee in the agri business, he said he was not working. \u201cI have been out every day since the war began to do shopping,\u201d explained Zhennya, who is in his mid 50s.\nThe Park Inn hotel \u2013 a looming glass tower \u2013 and the city\u2019s Olympic stadium were both devoid of inhabitants. But a coffee stand next to the station had miraculously reopened. Ruslan, a barista, said he went back to work on Wednesday. On Friday he said he had served 50 people \u2013 a small sign that life was carrying on.\nBack at the salon, a doctor working in Kyiv\u2019s hospital number 17 came in to deliver supplies. He also brought bad news: one of his patients included a pregnant woman fleeing from Irpin, north-west of Kyiv. A Russian shell had killed her husband and she had lost her baby, Yevhen said.\nTwo other fashionable Kyivans turned volunteers also dropped by at the salon, to pick up dog food. They were taking it to a new dog shelter. It has so far received 49 dogs \u2013 and one wolf \u2013 all apparently abandoned by owners who had fled Kyiv for western Ukraine, Poland and other destinations.\nWhen the war started, the Ukrainian government told citizens to stay at home and not go to work. But after several days of lockdown, supermarkets, petrol stations and pharmacies were told they could reopen. Many did. Now other businesses are considering starting to operate in this traumatic new normal.\nIn his latest video address on Friday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine and its capital had survived 16 days of Russian attack \u2013 longer than Moscow and many of the Ukraine\u2019s western supporters had anticipated. He spoke of a \u201cstrategic turning point\u201d. He even mentioned the word \u201cvictory\u201d.\nThis may be wishful thinking, but whether accurate or not, the owner of Kyiv\u2019s most famous Crimean Tatar restaurant, Musafir, said he was considering reopening on Saturday. Kemal Seitveliyev had been volunteering along with staff members. He said society needed to start functioning again even in these abnormal conditions.\nMusafir used to have three branches in Kyiv, but Seitveliyev said they were only using one because, as with the hair salon, his employees had mostly departed. \u201cA few people have called me to ask if we\u2019re open. So there is some interest. But let\u2019s see.\u201d He acknowledged that a reopening may be short-lived, if and when the bombs resume.\n\u201cIf they take Kyiv, well, that\u2019s the end,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Fears claims of plot to use birds to spread disease could be pretext for biological attack by Russia itself\nRussia has accused Ukraine and the US at the UN security council of a plot to use migratory birds and bats to spread pathogens, raising alarm among other council members that the accusations could be intended to provide cover for future Russian use of biological weapons.\nThe Russian permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, delivered a lengthy account of the alleged biological weapons plot, and said the birds, bats and insects supposedly intended to spread disease would cross Ukraine\u2019s western border.\n\u201cWe call upon you to think about a very real biological danger to the people in European countries, which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine,\u201d Nebenzya said. \u201cAnd if there is a such a scenario then all Europe will be covered.\n\u201cThe risk of this is very real given the interests of the radical nationalist groups in Ukraine are showing towards the work with dangerous pathogens conducted together with the ministry of defence of the United States.\u201d\nThe United Nations high representative for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the UN was \u201cnot aware of any biological weapons programmes\u201d in Ukraine, and pointed out there was an official channel for governments to raise any concerns about violations of the biological and toxin weapons convention banning their use.\nIn response to Nebenzya\u2019s claims, several member states on the security council warned that it could be a disinformation campaign ahead of a planned Russian attack inside Ukraine.\n\u201cThe intent behind these lies seems clear and it is deeply troubling,\u201d said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN. \u201cWe believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations as part of a false flag incident or to support tactical military operations.\u201d\nBefore the UN session, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, expressed similar concerns.\n\u201cAllegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a video address on Thursday. \u201cThis makes me really worried, because we\u2019ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia\u2019s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.\u201d\nRussian forces have continued their advance into Ukraine, bombing cities in the west of the country, including Lviv, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk.\nElsewhere, satellite photos appeared to show a massive convoy outside Kyiv had largely dispersed and redeployed. The US space technology company Maxar said its pictures showed armoured units had fanned out through towns and forests in the area, with artillery moved into potential firing positions.\nIn Moscow, Vladimir Putin announced 16,000 foreign \u201cvolunteers\u201d from the Middle East were ready to fight with Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine to \u201chelp\u201d the people living in the Donbas region. In a meeting with Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, Putin also said western-made weapons including Javelin and Stinger missiles that were captured by the Russian army would be handed to Donbas forces.\nAs heavy shelling continued across eastern Ukraine\u2019s towns and cites, Ukrainian authorities reported Russia had killed more civilians than soldiers. Russian forces were also reported to have hit a psychiatric hospital near Izyum, a town in the Kharkiv region. The regional governor, Oleh Synegubov, called it a \u201cwar crime against civilians [and] genocide against the Ukrainian nation\u201d. He said 330 people had been in the hospital at the time, including wheelchair users and people unable to move. The exact number of casualties is still to be established.\nIn the besieged port city of Mariupol conditions remain desperate, with people trapped inside indoor shelters with no heat, electricity and little or no food. More than 1,300 people had died in the 10-day siege, said Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk. \u201cThey [Russia] want to destroy the people of Mariupol. They want to make them starve. It\u2019s a war crime,\u201d she said.\nThe Associated Press spoke to an exhausted-looking resident as he pulled a cart loaded with bags down an empty street flanked by damaged buildings in the port city. \u201cI don\u2019t have a home any more. That\u2019s why I\u2019m moving,\u201d Aleksander Ivanov said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist any more. It was hit, by a mortar.\u201d\nMore than 400,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces, and basic supplies are running out. About 200,000 are believed to want to leave amid continuous Russian bombardment but have not been able to do so despite the daily declaration of humanitarian corridors.\nA UN spokesperson said there were credible reports of Russians using cluster munitions in populated areas. Cluster munitions, which scatter small bombs over a large area, are banned by more than 100 countries, including the UK, but not Russia, Ukraine or the US.\nMore than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine and a further 2 million are internally displaced, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said on Friday. The grim toll for Ukrainian civilians comes amid growing fears that Russia could stage a chemical attack, as senior Russian officials recycled old conspiracy theories about alleged western-made biological weapons.\nThe head of the Russian military\u2019s radiation, chemical and biological protection troops, Igor Kirillov, said on Thursday that US-backed labs in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa were working on pathogens custom-designed to target Russians and other Slavs. According to Russian-state media, Kirillov alleged the US planned to exploit Ukraine\u2019s \u201cunique geographical position\u201d by sending migratory birds carrying deadly diseases into Russia.\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, made a similar claim on Thursday, alleging that US-backed labs in Ukraine were working to \u201cdevelop ethnically targeted biological weapons\u201d. The director of the CIA, William Burns, told the US Senate intelligence committee that Russia could be laying the groundwork for a chemical or biological attack, which it would then blame on the US or Ukraine in a \u201cfalse flag operation\u201d.\n\u201cThis is something, as all of you know very well, [that] is very much a part of Russia\u2019s playbook,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve used these weapons against their own citizens, they\u2019ve at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere, so it\u2019s something we take very seriously.\u201d",

        "content": "The complexity of shifting an entire hospital during a flood emergency is mind-boggling, but doctors say an \u2018amazing\u2019 team made it work\nAs darkness descended on the northern rivers town of Ballina, a ragtag fleet of taxis, trucks and school buses began pulling up outside the town\u2019s small hospital, ready to take part in an extraordinary mission.\nThe 55-odd patients inside were at risk.\nFloods were inundating the northern rivers, and authorities believed the Richmond River would burst its banks, swelled by the basin\u2019s unprecedented saturation and a looming high tide.\nThe order was issued at 6pm on 1 March: the entire hospital was to be evacuated to a local high school, Xavier Catholic College in nearby Skennars Head.\nIt meant moving palliative care patients, people with dementia, the immobile and stroke victims.\nStaff were given three hours to prepare.\nAmong the three doctors on shift was Dr Katie Treble. The past 24 hours had sharpened her resolve.\nTreble, along with her dog, Jeff Bridges, had spent the previous day stuck on the roof of her inundated home in low-lying Mullumbimby.\n\u201cI thought \u2018no one predicted what happened in Mullum yesterday, and I\u2019ve lost all my stuff, my house is under water and my car\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m not going to take any chances\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no way I was having my patients go through what we went through.\u201d\nThe complexity of dismantling an entire hospital and setting it up again \u2013 at a school, of all places \u2013 in three hours is mind-boggling.\nHere, staff had to do it in the middle of a flood disaster, in the dark, knowing they might be overwhelmed by patients in coming days.\nTreble still isn\u2019t sure who organised the vehicles.\nBut they began to arrive at the hospital in numbers. So did the State Emergency Service, which offered to help however it could.\nSchool buses were used for patients who could walk. The hospital\u2019s sickest were transported via ambulance.\nTaxis, trucks and SES vehicles were used to transport ultrasound gear, trolleys, air mattresses, huge stocks of medicines, bags of fluid, and airway equipment.\nSome patients were incredibly difficult to move.\n\u201cA lot of them are confused, don\u2019t understand what is going on, and a lot of them are pretty bed-bound too,\u201d Treble says.\nXavier College\u2019s hall was transformed into a general ward using a sea of inflatable mattresses, each with an IV pole and stand.\nTaped to the end of each bed was a piece of A4 paper, recording a number and name for each patient.\nMonitors were run from batteries, and staff, lacking a usable IT system, converted all electronic records to paper form.\nA classroom was set up as the triage area for new patients, where a nurse waited for arrivals, standing in front of a two-by-two-metre screen, designed to give some semblance of privacy.\nThe classroom whiteboards were used to track patients and outstanding jobs and orders.\n\u201cIt had the opportunity to be just a terrible shit-show, and it was the opposite,\u201d Treble says. \u201cIt was slick and the communication between the team was good, I think everybody understood what role they had and the attitude of everybody was very much \u2018can-do\u2019 and \u2018how do I help?\u2019.\u201d\nAnother classroom was used as a resuscitation area. A GP clinic and mental health unit were set up in other parts of the school.\nSoon, the volunteers began to arrive. Doctors, nurses and hospital staff turned up in uniform, unpaid and unexpected, after hearing of the evacuation.\nMany, including emergency doctor Shaska Khosa, were arriving from extraordinary situations of their own.\nA day earlier, Khosa, who lives in Brunswick Heads, had launched a boat from a flooded street with her partner, Tom Lee Lewes, and joined a convoy of police rescue and surf lifesaving vessels to Mullumbimby.\n\u201cWe were just grabbing people from their houses and taking them up to slightly higher ground,\u201d she says.\nKhosa arrived at the high school at 2am one morning, expecting to stay for six hours to help. She worked a 14-hour shift.\nThere was no phone signal, she says, and some of the usual services a hospital relies on \u2013 including pathology \u2013 were nonexistent.\nThe flood disaster had cut off access to other regional medical centres, leading to an influx to the high school.\nSomehow, though, the hospital worked.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nBoth Khosa and Treble say no patient they dealt with lost any quality of care during the move, an incredible feat amid the unfolding disaster.\n\u201cIt was weirdly functional, and I think it\u2019s because emergency staff are used to working in the face of adversity,\u201d Khosa says. \u201cYou just very much worked around it, you went back to basic clinical skills: you don\u2019t have a chest X-ray, you\u2019re going to be listening to their lungs and you\u2019ve got an ultrasound machine.\u201d\nLater that week, when the flood threat eased, patients were returned to Ballina hospital.\nThe evacuation, like so much of what\u2019s occurred in the northern rivers, was unprecedented.\nNeither Treble, who worked for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Central African Republic, nor Khosa have ever been involved in anything like it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of anyone having to evacuate a hospital in three hours,\u201d Treble says. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it, not in the developed world, anyway.\n\u201cBut we had an amazing team.\u201d",

The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing.\nFor all the complexity of this case, a key question in its outcome will be a very simple one: were there any people inside the tunnel at Whiskey 108?\nTwo irreconcilable versions of events have emerged around that tunnel.\nRoberts-Smith has repeatedly told the court the tunnel contained a cache of arms, but no people.\nFour times during his evidence to court, Roberts-Smith has told Justice Anthony Besanko \u201cthere were no men in the tunnel\u201d, or \u201cthere were no people in the tunnel\u201d.\nBut so far this trial, five SAS soldiers \u2013 some still serving \u2013 have told the court they saw men pulled from the tunnel.\nThe presence of those men, or otherwise, is key because of what is alleged to have happened next.\nThe newspapers claim the two men pulled from the tunnel were later murdered: one, a disabled man with a prosthetic leg, was allegedly machine-gunned by Roberts-Smith himself, his leg later souvenired by another soldier as a ghoulish trophy of war, a drinking vessel for celebrating soldiers; the other, an elderly man, was allegedly executed by another soldier on Roberts-Smith\u2019s orders, a \u201cblooding\u201d of a new trooper.\nRoberts-Smith denies this ever happened, says it could never have happened, because there was never anybody in the tunnel.\nWhiskey 108 was the name given by the SAS to a compound in the village of Kakarak, a known stronghold and arms base for Taliban insurgents on the western side of the Dorafshan River in Afghanistan\u2019s southern Uruzgan province.\nAustralian SAS troops had been \u201coutside the wire\u201d in the province for several days before they received an order, late in the afternoon of 12 April 2009, to move on Whiskey 108. An airstrike was called in, a bomb dropped into the middle of the compound, and they fought their way through the river valley\u2019s \u201cgreen zone\u201d, killing at least two insurgents en route, to the perimeter of the mud-walled compound.\nAfter the fight-through to secure the compound \u2013 which passed without significant incident \u2013 the patrol commanders gathered in a courtyard, amid the rubble of the bombed-out compound, to plan the next phase of the operation.\nIt was then that one soldier, moving a pile of grass to check what lay beneath, discovered the entrance to a tiny tunnel.\nStraight away, the Australian soldiers had their guns trained down the hole.\nIt is here that the versions of events described to the court diverge, and part irreconcilably.\nThe testimony from six SAS soldiers has focused on what happened next at Whiskey 108. Five soldiers have said they saw people emerge from the tunnel, one has said he saw two Afghan men in the custody of Australian troops next to the tunnel entrance.\nThe soldiers\u2019 testimonies have not been identical.\nIn some versions of events, Australian troops called themselves for anyone in the tunnel to surrender and come out, in others, the message was relayed through an interpreter, assisted by two Afghan women who had been detained in the compound.\nOne soldier has told the court he put his head and shoulders inside the tunnel and saw two men inside.\nAnother soldier, Person 43, said while he recalled there were two \u201cpersons under control\u201d found at Whiskey 108, he had recollections he helped only one come out of the tunnel. He told the court he knelt down beside the tunnel to help drag the unarmed man out. \u201cHe started to stand up and I reached down and pulled him out.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t resisting,\u201d Person 43 said, \u201chis hands were up in the universal \u2018I give up\u2019 position.\u201d\nAnother serving soldier, Person 40, said he watched two men emerge.\n\u201cThey were obviously very frightened. One had a distinctive limp \u2026 immediately [upon] coming out of his tunnel he was lifting his trousers, pointing to his prosthetic leg, expecting some sympathy from the troops.\u201d\nPerson 40 said both men, whom he believed were Taliban, were searched, \u201cand from there they were marched off to another area, by Roberts-Smith and Person 35 [another Australian soldier]\u201d.\n\u201cMy understanding is that they would be TQed (tactically questioned), and Ben Roberts-Smith was the lead TQer on the ground.\u201d\nPerson 40 said he expected the men to be taken back to the Australians\u2019 Tarin Kowt base: \u201cThat\u2019s the SOP (standard operating procedure).\u201d\nHowever, Person 40 told the court no prisoners were taken back to Tarin Kowt from that mission. He never saw the men alive again.\nOne soldier, anonymised as Person 41, gave evidence to the court about an alleged execution at Whiskey 108.\nHe told the court he was investigating a room inside the compound where he had discovered bomb-making materials and opium when he emerged into a courtyard to see Roberts-Smith and another soldier, known as Person 4, standing above a kneeling elderly Afghan male, near the entrance to a tunnel.\nPerson 41 said: \u201cRS [Roberts-Smith] walked down and grabbed the Afghan male by the scruff of his shirt.\u201d\nHe said Roberts-Smith walked the man about two metres until he was in front of Person 4, \u201cthen kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down \u2026 RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 \u2018shoot him\u2019.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nPerson 41 said he did not want to witness what he realised was about to occur, and stepped back into the room where he had previously been. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve fired thousands of those rounds and I know what they sound like\u201d. He waited another \u201c15 or so seconds\u201d before stepping back into the courtyard.\nHe said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head.\nHe inspected the body. \u201cThere was quite a lot of blood flowing from the head wound.\u201d\nThe two Australian soldiers did not speak.\n\u201cHe seemed to be in a bit of shock to me.\u201d\nPerson 4, subpoenaed as a witness by the newspapers, spent nearly a week in the witness box during this trial.\nWhile he gave evidence about other SAS missions he participated in, Person 4 objected to answering questions about his actions at Whiskey 108: \u201cI object on grounds of self-incrimination,\u201d he told the court. After intense legal debate over whether he should be compelled to respond, the judge ruled he did not have to answer.\nPerson 41 also gave evidence about standing in a cordon outside the Whiskey 108 compound following the Australian fight-through, telling the court, as he stood guard, he saw Roberts-Smith \u201cfrog-marching\u201d an Afghan man \u201cby the scruff of his neck\u201d away from the compound entrance.\n\u201cHe [Roberts-Smith] had his machine gun in his right arm \u2026 he then proceeded to throw the Afghan male down onto the ground. The Afghan male landed on his back. \u2018RS\u2019 then reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder and flipped him onto his stomach. Then I observed him lower his machine gun and shoot approximately three to five rounds into the back of the Afghan male.\u201d\n\u201cAfter he\u2019d done that, he looked up and saw me standing there, and looked at me and said \u2018are we all cool, we good?\u2019. I just replied, \u2018yeah mate, no worries\u2019.\u201d\nAnother soldier was also in the cordon surrounding the compound. Person 14 said the light was fading when he heard heavy footsteps to his right.\n\u201cAs I turned my head to my right, there were three Australian soldiers and a black object, which was similar to a human, that was thrown to the ground.\u201d\nPerson 14 said the person made a thudding, \u201cexpulsion of air\u201d noise as they hit the ground.\n\u201cThen a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para and fired an extended burst. It was loud, like a \u2018BRRRRRT\u2019 for one second.\u201d\n\u201cThat person turned and walked away out of sight back into Whiskey 108.\u201d\nPerson 14 said he turned to his patrol\u2019s second-in-command and said \u201cwhat the hell what that?\u201d He said he did not recognise the soldier who fired at the time.\nBut Person 14 said the soldier who shot the man was wearing a distinctive new camouflage paint, worn only by one SAS patrol in action that day, the five-man team of which Roberts-Smith was a member.\nPerson 14 later checked the body of the slain man \u2013 he had gunshot wounds to the centre of his torso and blood coming from his mouth and nose. Person 14 saw that the man had a prosthetic leg.\nLater in the day, Person 14 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith carrying the distinctive Minimi weapon at the troops\u2019 lay-up point.\n\u201cI saw who had the Para Minimi [machine gun],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Ben Roberts-Smith.\u201d\nRoberts-Smith has been resolute in his evidence.\nIn June last year, under cross-examination, he was repeatedly asked about what happened at Whiskey 108. Four times he told the court \u201cthere were no men in the tunnel\u201d or \u201cthere were no people in the tunnel\u201d.\nHe said testimony that men were pulled from the tunnel was \u201ccompletely false\u201d.\nIt is not disputed Roberts-Smith shot and killed the man with the prosthetic leg.\nRoberts-Smith told the court he killed the man because he was a threat to Australian troops. Roberts-Smith said he saw him, armed and running, and killed him in accordance with troops\u2019 rules of engagement.\nRoberts-Smith told the court he was standing outside the compound when he saw the man, \u201cnot running directly at me, but coming on an arc\u201d.\n\u201cHe had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that \u2026 hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.\u201d\nRoberts-Smith said the other man killed at Whiskey 108 was also an insurgent, also armed, and killed in combat by another Australian soldier.\nRoberts-Smith said after he had killed the man with a prosthetic leg he had a weapons stoppage, as he was kneeling to fix it, another SAS soldier shot and killed the second man.\n\u201cMy assumption was it was someone in my team, so either Person 18 or Person 4 was my assumption, but I actually don\u2019t know.\u201d\nUnder cross-examination, he was asked \u201cthis is a person who, on your account, saved your life?\n\u201cYes,\u201d Roberts-Smith replied, but said, to this day, he does not know which soldier it was.\nIn the witness box, Person 18 denied being involved in a firefight at Whiskey 108. Person 4 was not questioned on his actions at Whiskey 108.\nUnder cross-examination, the SAS witnesses who have been questioned over Whiskey 108 over the past fortnight have been asked whether their memories of the mission are hazy or faulty, whether they have conflated Whiskey 108 with other operations, or whether their stories were confected out of malice to harm Roberts-Smith. They have denied those assertions, and reaffirmed their evidence.\nThis trial has weeks left still to run. The newspapers are only partway through their witnesses. Roberts-Smith may call up to 20 witnesses-in-reply. He may even take the stand again himself in order to rebut some of the allegations against him, though he has already given his version of events at Whiskey 108.\nFor all of the vast sweep of this mammoth trial, a simple tunnel dug into the soil of Afghanistan could prove critical: was there anyone inside?",

        "content": "The small town in northern NSW was cut off by flood waters for five days. Susan Chenery surveys a devastated community\nThe first thing that hits you is the smell \u2013 the reek of overflowing sewage, rotting animal corpses in the river, decaying vegetable matter, toxic waste, all the things the flood brought up. It gets into your skin that smell. Under a low grey sky in bacterial heat, the town of Coraki is a wasteland, a dystopian nightmare. In the air above us, helicopters drag bales of hay across the brown inland sea that surrounds the town.\nPiled high outside almost every house, are belongings encased in sludge and mud, the entire lives of the occupants. No one has escaped this disaster. People are still very raw. Coraki is where the Richmond and Wilson rivers meet and the area felt the full brunt of both flooded rivers. On Monday 28 February firefighter Shane Cox was wading around in the water helping people, when he says it \u201cwent up another 2 metres\u201d.\nDominique Sorrenson had about 4% battery left on her phone when she put a Facebook post up to let people know she was at her house. A water surge had come through her home and cut off her electricity. \u201cI had my elderly father who had health conditions, the next morning a boat rocked up and picked us up because of my Facebook friends,\u201d she says.\nCoraki was marooned for five days by flood water and residents were forced to fend for themselves without help or supplies. The army broke through on Sunday. People\u2019s legs are cut and bruised from being in contaminated water full of sharp objects. There is a risk of mosquito borne diseases. Electricity has started coming back on in some houses, but the internet is still sporadic. People are living on the streets, under tarpaulins, disoriented, despairing, running on adrenaline.\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d says volunteer Sharsha Witthahn, \u201cis tired and broken\u201d.\nThe outlying communities are still in the rescue phase. On Thursday private boats were being loaded and launched with provisions and medical supplies for those still out there. For the first time paramedics were on board, after volunteers had become concerned about mental health issues. Volunteer Miriam Meyers says the paramedics were \u201cadministering tetanus shots, antibiotics for infections gotten from moving machinery and metal debris, dressing wounds\u201d.\n\u201cPeople are presenting with chemical burns because of leaking diesel,\u201d she says.\nKate Coxall, a reporter with the Lismore App, a former volunteer firefighter and a trained support facilitator, had thought she might be \u201coverzealous\u201d when she evacuated her daughter and dog from her house at nearby Bungawalbin to her neighbours on Sunday 27 February. \u201cI just felt something was wrong, I moved my landlord\u2019s cows that day from thigh-deep water to the top paddocks,\u201d she says.\nReturning to her house the next day, she says: \u201cI was absolutely shocked.\u201d She waded through 1.5-metre-deep water to rescue her chickens.\nOn the way back to her neighbour\u2019s house Coxall says she saw a family of five carrying an outboard motor and a boat trying to get to Coraki, nearly 20km away. Some of them were shoeless, one had a big gash on his head. \u201cWe begged them, \u2018please stay with us, it\u2019s not safe,\u2019 the waters at this point were raging,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t listen, and then an hour later we saw an urgent message for emergency services because they had chained themselves in the tinny to a tree.\u201d Coxall spent several hours frantically trying to get help for them before hearing they had been rescued.\nAt her neighbour\u2019s house, the water kept rising. Coxall had left a flashing torch on a fence post, deck lights on and had been waving at passing choppers but they were missed in the cloud cover.\nThey were there for two days with a ladder up against the roof, her neighbour starting to get sepsis in her foot. \u201cThere is nothing worse than feeling like you have been left and forgotten and accounted for as collateral damage,\u201d Coxall says.\nWhen the ADF chopper finally came she had to leave her dog behind. \u201cShe tried to follow us, I will never forget her face.\u201d\nFrom the moment she landed in Lismore Coxall was trying to get her dog and other people\u2019s pets rescued. \u201cGathering GPS coordinates, addresses, numbers of people, numbers of animals and all that sort of thing,\u201d she says. \u201cOrganising choppers and going out on boats myself. For us, it is day 14 and we\u2019re still doing rescues.\u201d\nA few days after her own rescue, her dog was brought out by a private chopper helping in the area. And Coxall, who has lost everything, remains indefatigable in helping the community still out there.\n\u201cThe water is only dropping half a metre each day and \u2026 we\u2019ve only lost five metres of height,\u201d Coxall says. \u201cIf there is more rain they could be out there for another two weeks easily.\n\u201cMost [locals] have no vehicles left. One of them had a severe back injury, he couldn\u2019t move, he\u2019s there by himself with five dogs. It took us two days to get medication to him.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people with cuts, we\u2019re worried about septicaemia and people self-treating with whatever they can get from neighbours. I\u2019m worried about people\u2019s mental and physical health. I\u2019m seriously worried about anyone who may have a time sensitive injury, there are so many brown snakes out there.\u201d\nMost of the properties are on 100-acre blocks run by tough and stoic people. \u201cThey will say other people are worse off than us and they are in a really shit situation,\u201d volunteer Meyers says. \u201cThere are people on remote properties who are not on social media, they don\u2019t have the resources to ask for help. If you are not on Instagram no one is going to turn up to help.\u201d\nCoxall agrees: \u201cYesterday we suddenly found out that there was a family under tarps with nothing. It is not even as though we have accounted for everybody yet. And that is what is terrifying. We think there are at least 50 people out there.\u201d\nSome people are choosing not to leave their properties because they have horses and cattle to look after. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where they would even go,\u201d Meyers says.\n\u201cAt this point it is about welfare. They are in ankle-deep water, none of them are taking care of themselves. They are all troopers, reclusive, they don\u2019t want the fuss. But I can tell you for sure, they are very happy when they see you on the boat.\u201d",

The company is already contracted to buy gas used to make the fertiliser from Woodside Energy\u2019s Scarborough gas field.\nThe plant has been strongly supported by both the Western Australian and federal governments, with $255m given to the company to build water and marine infrastructure nearby.\nBuilding the plant would, however, require the removal of rock art at three sites.\nThe company has been given approval by the Western Australian government to go ahead with the removal but it is understood it does not yet have the work approvals required to start.\nThe Burrup Peninsula in the Pilbara \u2013 known as Murujuga to traditional custodians \u2013 is also an outdoor gallery home to over a million examples of Indigenous rock art produced over a period of 50,000 years.\nThe area was nominated for a world heritage listing in 2018. If successful, this would mean the area is protected in the same way as the pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal.\nWhile Perdaman has claimed to have the full support of the traditional owners to remove the art, this has been contested.\nRaelene Cooper, a Mardudhunera woman and former board member of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, said elders and members of the community had been misinformed about the nature of work.\n\u201cThe elders never approved this,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey had no understanding of it. No one had ever explained to them what was really going on.\n\u201cI mentioned that they were going to start removing the rock art and said they don\u2019t want that. They said so repeatedly.\u201d\nPerdaman was contacted for comment.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nCooper and another custodian, Josie Alec, wrote to Australia\u2019s environment minister, Sussan Ley, asking her to use emergency powers under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to stop the rock art removal.\nIn response, the federal environment department asked Perdaman not to go ahead until a review can be carried out.\nA spokesperson for Ley said the department would review the application to remove the art \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\n\u201cAt this time the scheduling of works remains a matter for the proponent who must meet all conditions including those relating to the protection of Indigenous cultural heritage,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nCooper said the situation had a renewed urgency after the inquiry into the destruction of sacred sites at Juukan Gorge following international outcry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite concerning the government would support us in a way with world heritage nomination with all the rock and history, and then turn around, putting a $4.5bn plant in there and remove that history,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI find it astonishing.\u201d\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nAs well as physical destruction of the rock art by removal, there are also concerns about the cumulative effect of air pollution from increasing industrial development in the area.\nThe University of Western Australia honorary research fellow John Black said air pollution from gas production and other industrial operations builds up on the rock face, where it makes the surface more acidic, causing the paint to break down.\n\u201cThe main problem with urea is that it provides a nitrogen source for microbes and those microbes produce organic acids,\u201d Black said.\n\u201cThe thing about the Murujuga environment is that it was extraordinarily deficient in nitrogen. The only organisms that use to live [in] them were able to convert nitrogen from the air into biological form.\n\u201cNow what we\u2019re doing is providing various forms of nitrogen as pollution.\u201d",

government\u2019s plan to restore its power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens has been criticised as \u201cdisrespectful and wrong\u201d and a \u201csignificant step backwards\u201d in the recognition of Aboriginal societies.\nBoth claims are made in submissions to an appeal by the federal government to overturn the landmark Love and Thoms decision.\nIn February 2020 the high court held in a four-three split that Aboriginal Australians were not aliens for the purpose of the constitution and could not be deported.\nIn November, the federal court ordered the release of Shayne Montgomery, finding it was \u201cnot reasonable\u201d to conclude the New Zealand citizen was not Aboriginal because, although he lacked biological descent from an Aboriginal person, he had been culturally adopted as Aboriginal.\nIn its appeal against that decision, the government has sought leave to overturn Love and Thoms, which has resulted in at least 10 people being released from immigration detention since it was handed down.\nMontgomery\u2019s bid to resist that has been bolstered by interventions by the Victorian government, the Australian Human Rights Commission, National Native Title Council and the Northern Land Council.\nMontgomery\u2019s lawyers submitted that the commonwealth\u2019s claim there is no clear common reasoning between the four judges in the majority in Love and Thoms \u201cis both disrespectful and wrong\u201d.\nThey contended the point of Love and Thoms \u201cis clear and easy to understand: Aboriginal Australians \u2026 have such bonds of attachment to this nation and its territory\u201d that they cannot be subject to the \u201cdisabilities of aliens\u201d, such as visa cancellation.\nThey argued the commonwealth was \u201cno more than [a] disappointed litigant\u201d, warning that the \u201ccertainty of our legal system would collapse\u201d if the fact the four majority judges expressed their reasoning differently were used to reconsider the precedent.\n\u201cThe appellants \u2026 just do not like the result which they obtained from this court.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\u201cThat dislike gives them no claim or right to disrupt the legal certainty and authority flowing from the decision of this court.\u201d\nMontgomery\u2019s lawyers also rejected the commonwealth\u2019s claim that the decision threatens to confer \u201cpolitical sovereignty on Aboriginal societies\u201d, arguing it does not give legislative or constitutional power to Aboriginal societies to determine who is a non-alien.\nNNTC argued that it should be a matter for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to decide \u201cin any context, who is or who is not an \u2018Aboriginal Australian\u2019\u201d.\nThe NNTC described Love and Thoms as a protection against being found to be \u201caliens\u201d and \u201clike\u201d the second Mabo native title decision \u201can important step\u201d in the journey to recognise Indigenous connection to Australia and the \u201cenduring authority of tradition law and custom in Aboriginal societies\u201d.\n\u201cThe appellants\u2019 submissions, if accepted, would remove that protection, and \u2013 fundamentally \u2013 take a significant step backwards in that journey.\u201d\nThe AHRC sought to intervene, warning in its submissions that restoring the power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens would \u201cadversely affect the fundamental rights and interests of individuals\u201d including the \u201cserious interferences with the right to personal liberty\u201d.\nOverturning the case \u201cmay permit a larger group of Indigenous Australians to be permanently removed from Australia\u201d, it said.\nThe AHRC noted the fact that Indigenous births are registered at lower rates than non-Indigenous births, suggesting that people entitled to Australian citizenship who cannot prove they or a parent were born in Australia could be found to be aliens.\nThe Victorian government argued the commonwealth is seeking to \u201cmake the same arguments that a majority of the court rejected approximately two years ago\u201d.\nAlthough two judges in the majority have retired since the decision, Victoria warned that a change in the composition of the court \u201cis not and never has been reason enough\u201d to overrule previous judgments.\nThe Northern Land Council backed Montgomery\u2019s case that the category of non-citizen non-alien should be extended to those culturally adopted as Indigenous, because descent is determined by cultural not genetic factors in Aboriginal societies.\nThe NNTC also argued that, since not all Aboriginal Australians are native title holders, \u201csome other test or standard\u201d should be used to determine who is a non-citizen non-alien.\nOn Wednesday the high court heard Brendan Thoms\u2019 case about whether his detention was unlawful, which could expose the commonwealth to claims of compensation by non-citizen non-aliens who were detained before the February 2020 high court decision.\nThe Montgomery case is expected to be heard in early April, although Montgomery has sought to have the case permanently stayed.",

But the party needs a gear change to convince voters their leader is the man for the moment\nPenny Wong won\u2019t be fronting any of the election night television coverage this time around. Back in 2019, Labor\u2019s Senate leader was on the ABC\u2019s election night panel. As Labor lost the election it thought it would win, Wong had to sit, stoic, controlled, analysing the incoming shellacking for hours.\nNever again, she says. In a conversation for my podcast this weekend, Wong recalls one of her more terrible nights. She says she knew by 7.30pm Labor was not returning to government, because the scrutineers in Queensland were telegraphing a blow out. \u201cI remember calculating how many hours I\u2019d have to be on television before Bill [Shorten] conceded,\u201d she says.\nThe trauma remains deep etched, for Wong, and for Labor.\nWong is on the podcast for a conversation about defence and foreign affairs, given Scott Morrison is fully intent on a khaki election. She raises election night in 2019 when I ask her how she is contemplating conducting foreign affairs differently, given oppositions always plan for a transition. Wong corrects my terminology. \u201cWe\u2019re planning,\u201d she says. After 2019, \u201cI don\u2019t contemplate. I plan for what we have to do without engaging in any assumption\u201d.\nWe are starting here this weekend because Wong\u2019s summary neatly encapsulates Labor\u2019s current mindset. Planning. Hoping, but after the 2019 rout, the opposition is too nervous to assume anything.\nBut with the budget now in sight, and the campaign proper then under way shortly after, Labor is executing a gear change. A political party that thinks and moves as a collective, even during periods of maximum derangement, is entering the season of Anthony Albanese.\nObviously Albanese has led his party for a full parliamentary term, steering colleagues past the trauma of the defeat, so when I say the season of Albanese, I mean Labor is about to learn whether or not the bloke up front can persuade voters he is the man for the moment.\nTo this end, Albanese is assembling the components of his alternative prime minister story. There were two scene-setting speeches this week \u2013 one to a business summit arranged by the Australian Financial Review, and another to a foreign and defence policy related outing at the Lowy Institute.\nThe spine of Albanese\u2019s pitch to voters is \u201cI represent safe change\u201d. In that spirit, the Labor leader had two messages for the business community. The first was he planned to govern in the consensus style of Bob Hawke. The second was Labor had a growth and productivity agenda. Albanese would champion aspiration as well as fairness.\nAt Lowy, Albanese wanted to project that he was a person who would bring a level of institutional seriousness back to the prime ministership. He told the foreign policy boffins he intended to \u201crestore a greater sense of responsibility to the office of the prime minister\u201d.\nAlbanese also picked up some broken pieces from his near past. Asked by Lowy\u2019s executive director, Michael Fullilove, to identify prime ministers he\u2019d admired from a foreign policy perspective, Albanese eventually got to John Curtin (given Curtin, for Labor people, is always the correct answer).\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nBut first, he nominated Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Albanese said he\u2019d seen Rudd \u201cup close\u201d during his first G20 meeting in London during the global financial crisis, shuttling between Barack Obama and the Chinese delegation. \u201cI saw Australia punching above our weight,\u201d he said. Albanese said Rudd had yanked Australia out of \u201cthe naughty corner\u201d in global forums by ratifying the Kyoto protocol.\nLest anyone be accused of having a favourite sibling, Albanese added: \u201cThe relationship Julia Gillard forged with president Obama was extraordinary. It led to Julia addressing Washington in a celebrated address, and a great honour for our country, and it led to the increased presence of US Marines in the Northern Territory.\u201d\nThese reflections felt sincere, but they were also very obviously didactic and rehabilitative. Albanese wanted to project a sense of competence from the recent past \u2013 a past in which he\u2019d been a significant actor. Rudd/Gillard/Rudd wasn\u2019t all civil war was his point. That government I was part of wasn\u2019t all rank self-indulgence. We did things too.\nIn addition to the speeches, Albanese has done the obligatory Women\u2019s Weekly profile \u2013 a rite of passage for any prime ministerial aspirant. This Sunday, a let\u2019s meet the \u201creal Albo\u201d 60 Minutes special will bookend Jenny Morrison, Morrison and his ukulele a couple of weeks back.\nSo you can see where this is all going.\nBut it\u2019s also reasonable to wonder at this juncture why it has taken the Labor campaign so long to colour between the lines. The simple question is this: why is Operation Define Not At All Scary Albo running so late in the political cycle when opinion polls tell us there\u2019s a reasonable chunk of voters who haven\u2019t yet formed a view about the Labor leader?\nIf we cast our memories back to 2007, when Kevin Rudd took on John Howard, and won, Rudd was out telling voters \u201ca number of people have described me as an economic conservative\u201d a full five months before the election.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nRemember those ads? I bet you do. They are entirely memorable in the sense that peak chutzpah always is. Because Rudd\u2019s serene humblebrag was so ludicrously audacious, the advertisements became a cultural conversation piece, generating a bunch of free media follow-up.\nRudd had wanted to lure the Liberals into talking more about him, so that campaign was more than introductory. It was bait, and the bait worked.\nNow obviously Albanese does talk about his values and background frequently. There have also been a couple of dry run marketing prototypes. In March 2021, there was the \u201cAlbo\u2019s story\u201d montage prepared for the ALP national conference. Then in December 2021, for a rally in Sydney\u2019s inner west, there was the \u201cbetter future\u201d pitch.\nBut neither of those pitches were pushed out forcefully across social media, radio or television to voters who only watch politics out of the corner of their eyes. For weeks, I\u2019ve been wondering when that might change.\nGiven the log cabin narrative is such a basic building block in professional campaigning, the absence has felt deliberate. I\u2019ve wondered whether Albanese has resisted traditional mass market definitional efforts because, fundamentally, he prefers ambiguity. Albanese has prospered this long in politics, in part, because he knows how and when to dance between the raindrops.\nI haven\u2019t been the only person curious. Some Liberals have also been scratching their heads. Is this a lack of money? Is this some kind of deep, risk aversion? In any case, Morrison, of course, is never one to die wondering. The prime minister has sought to exploit the opening Albanese has left by moving to define the Labor leader himself.\nIf you watch politics closely, you\u2019ll know Morrison\u2019s efforts on this front have intensified significantly over this past month or so. Albanese is weak, and sneaky. The Labor leader is Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate for the election. And so on.\nFrom my vantage point, the tone of this desperate barrage landed somewhere between hyperbole and hysteria.\nBut Morrison isn\u2019t talking to me, he\u2019s talking to the disengaged voters that determine the outcome of elections, and some of these people would struggle to identify Albanese in a line-up. People who conduct focus groups for a living, whose judgment I trust, tell me people are deeply angry with Morrison at the moment, but they are not yet volunteering a positive assessment of Albanese in the way voters did, unprompted, about Rudd in 2007.\nGiven Morrison is currently on the rampage, firing indiscriminately, it would make sense for Labor to call time on strategic ambiguity, if this is, in fact, a strategy.\nApparently that\u2019s about to happen. People say a campaign defining the Labor leader and the coming contest is hovering in the wings. I suspect it will surface over the coming week or two, on all major mediums.\nAlbanese has copped a fair bit of flak since taking the leadership for playing it safe. But if the polls are right, the leader\u2019s political instincts and judgments have, thus far at least, kept Labor in the contest, at a time when the power of incumbency should wipe any political insurgency off the map.\nSo perhaps he\u2019s right to have left colouring in between the lines this late in the political cycle. Perhaps it\u2019s best to wait until people are fully tuned in.\nBut if Labor loses because voters ultimately don\u2019t feel as if they have a grip on the Morrison alternative \u2013 and therefore aren\u2019t confident Albanese means safe change \u2013 holding back will have been a big judgment call to get wrong.",
