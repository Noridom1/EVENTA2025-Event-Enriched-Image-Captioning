        "content": "Exclusive: Supreme court president wants to see more progress in diversity of senior benches\nThe judiciary needs to be more diverse so that the public feel those on the bench are genuinely \u201cour judges\u201d rather than \u201cbeings from another planet\u201d, the president of the supreme court has said.\nIn an interview to mark the centenary of the 1919 act that dismantled barriers preventing women from entering the professions, Lady Hale called for a more balanced gender representation on the UK\u2019s highest court as well as swifter progress promoting those from minority ethnic backgrounds and with \u201cless privileged lives\u201d.\nWomen working in law and other professions are increasingly aware and resentful of earning less than men, said Hale, who is the court\u2019s first female president since its creation 10 years ago. She also described the compulsory retirement age of 70 for judges as a \u201cwaste of talent\u201d.\nThis year, 2019, marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of the supreme court. Hale said she believed in its first decade the court had improved the accessibility and transparency of the legal system while establishing its independence more \u201cvisibly\u201d.\nBased in a neo-gothic building opposite parliament, the supreme court has pioneered live-streaming its proceedings, welcomes visitors, holds public exhibitions and prints comprehensible summaries of its complex judgments.Hale has supported the pursuit of gender equality as consistently as she can within the constitutional restraints of her position. There are currently three female justices on the UK\u2019s 12-seat supreme court \u2013 a rapid advancement on the position up until mid-2017 when she was the only woman. But how many women should there be?\n\u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg [the long-serving US supreme court justice, when asked the same question] famously said: \u2018When there are nine\u2019. There are [only] nine justices on the US supreme court bench,\u201d Hale explained. \u201cMy own view is up to a quarter [on the UK supreme court] is an important breakthrough but that there\u2019s no right number of justices of either gender. An ideal balance would be at least 60/40 either way. And so we still have a little way to go towards that.\u201d\nThere are several reasons for desiring a more diverse judiciary in terms of gender balance, ethnicity and social background, Hale said. The most important of these is so the public can \u201clook at the judges and say \u2018They are our judges\u2019,\u201d rather than seeing them as \u201cbeings from another planet\u201d.\nIn the high court, court of appeal and supreme court, a quarter of judges are women. Among district judges, around a third are female. Diversity, Hale said, also helps by bringing \u201cdifferent perspectives to the discussion\u201d, particularly on a \u201ccollegiate\u201d court. \u201cWe are all products of our background and our experiences, so the greater the diversity, the better.\u201d\nHaving more than one woman on the supreme court had demonstrated that \u201cwomen are as different to one another as men are\u201d she said, acknowledging that it had been \u201crefreshing\u201d to sit with other women.\nWhile overt discrimination is illegal, there remain hurdles to overcome. \u201cWe do have in this country a gender pay gap to worry about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more pay is [delivered] through individual negotiation rather than collective agreement, the greater the risk of imbalance.\n\u201c[Women] are just waking up to the fact that they are not being paid as much. I have heard terrible stories about even successful women barristers being offered out by their [chamber] clerks at less than their male equivalents. That\u2019s an area where there\u2019s still work to do.\u201d\nSexual harassment has also caused problems for women at the bar, Hale said. She had not personally experienced problems during her career, she said, but was aware of its sexist culture \u2013 at least in the past.\n\u201cI do recall that when I was being elected to the northern circuit they required young women being elected to get on the table [as an initiation rite],\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t require me to get on the table. [I don\u2019t know] whether they thought I could not get up or whether [it was because] I was already married to a member of the circuit.\u201d\nMore progress was needed in advancing people from ethnic minority backgrounds into the higher judiciary, Hale said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that [the pace of promotion] is slower: it is [only] more recently that members of ethnic minorities have joined the legal profession in larger numbers. Although there\u2019s definitely a way to go, [the discrepancy] may not be as bad as we thought.\u201d\nThere is already a strong presence of ethnic minority judges in tribunals, county courts and among district judges, she said. \u201cThe way we can try and improve diversity in the higher echelons is being more open to transfers from other [courts]. And there have been appointments from the upper tier [tribunals] to the high court. So that is beginning to happen [though] it\u2019s still quite slow.\u201d\nShe hoped the judiciary would attract \u201cmore people who have had less privileged lives\u201d. Hale added: \u201cI have had a privileged life [but] I don\u2019t come from a privileged background and that is helpful. I have experienced various disappointments and setbacks in my life. I think all of this is quite helpful.\u201d\nLady Hale does not approve of positive discrimination, chiefly because \u201cno one wants to feel they have got the job in any way other than on their own merits\u201d. Better outreach efforts to encourage candidates are more productive, she said.\nNow 73, she is one of a small number of judges appointed before 1995 who are permitted to stay on the bench until they reach the age of 75. All those appointed since then have to retire at 70. Hale follows her predecessor, Lord Neuberger, in questioning that rule given the current shortage of high court judges.\n\u201c[He] called for the retirement age to go back to 75 and there\u2019s obviously a case for that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a waste of talent.\u201d It would help solve the \u201cdifficulty of recruiting to the high court bench so that people could be attracted after the most expensive years of life\u201d, she said. \u201cMy husband sat until he was 75 in a \u2026 property tribunal and no one could possibly doubt he still had a huge amount to offer.\u201d\nThe argument against extending the compulsory retirement age has been that it creates \u201cbed blocking\u201d, slowing the progress of younger judges up the career ladder.\n\u201cThe longer the old, white men [stay on] \u2026 the fewer posts there are for the younger more diverse judges,\u201d she said. \u201cBut given the recruitment problems, I\u2019m not sure that holds good. It does seem rather sad in these days to have a [retirement] age of 70.\u201d\nThis year the supreme court, having visited Edinburgh and Belfast, is due to sit in Wales. Hale, who was born in Yorkshire, would like to hear cases outside London in the north of England and the West Country.\nOne of her proudest moments, Hale said, was the article 50 case in 2016 that decided the course of Brexit amid a political and media furore. Following the high court decision, the judges were condemned as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d for ruling against the government.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the [article 50, Gina] Miller case because it was a classic constitutional issue about what the government could do and what parliament could do,\u201d Hale explained. \u201cIt was reminiscent of the 17th-century battle between parliament and the king. We were reinforcing principles that had been established then.\u201d\nMoving the law lords out of parliament and into a separate supreme court had made \u201cjudicial independence more visible\u201d, she said. The way the media treated the article 50 case at the supreme court was very different to coverage of what happened in the high court, Hale said.\nThis month the supreme court will host a display celebrating the centenary of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, which enabled women to join the legal profession and others.\nAfter Brexit the supreme court is unlikely to continue referring questions about EU law to the European court of justice in Luxembourg. \u201cWe shall have to work it out for ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it will be for the better or worse, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n This article was amended on 2 January 2019 to note that 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of the supreme court and to add in more details from Hale\u2019s interview reflecting on its achievements.",

        "content": "The midwinter window is open and will close on 31 January \u2013 what do the Premier League clubs want and who can they get?\nUnai Emery is two men down because of long-term injuries to Rob Holding and Danny Welbeck and so he would be open to adding a defender and striker. But with Aaron Ramsey on his way out and the continuing uncertainty over Mesut \u00d6zil, what he really wants is a new midfielder. David Hytner\nA spate of knee injuries has left Eddie Howe with a defensive crisis, particularly at right-back with Simon Francis and Adam Smith sidelined. Howe has stated how January is a notoriously difficult time to recruit, but injuries have forced him into a rethink. Links to Nathaniel Clyne make sense, and Howe admires Brentford\u2019s Chris Mepham. Keeping hold of Callum Wilson, a Chelsea target, will be crucial. Ben Fisher\nChris Hughton has been trying to reduce the burden on Glenn Murray ever since promotion. Attempts to lure the Liverpool forward Dominic Solanke appear to have failed, though J\u00fcrgen Locadia\u2019s form has eased anxiety. They have also been linked with Tunisia\u2019s Youssef Msakni. The Rangers captain James Tavernier and Wigan playmaker Nick Powell were previously of interest. BF\nSean Dyche has described Burnley as minnows when it comes to matching other Premier League clubs for spending power, which is why they frequently raid the Championship in their search for value. The same may happen this January, as long as Burnley can convince targets they are not about to return to the Championship, with West Brom\u2019s Jay Rodriguez and Matt Phillips among the usual suspects, along with Conor Hourihane of Aston Villa. Paul Wilson\nNeil Warnock said on Saturday that Cardiff had \u201cnine or 10 concrete inquiries in for players\u201d, which provides an indication of how desperate he is to strengthen. He would like to take Nathaniel Clyne on loan from Liverpool but the priority remains a proven striker. A budget of \u00a310-12m feels realistic. Stuart James\nChelsea are attempting to secure Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund for the summer, and have spoken to Juventus and Milan about taking Gonzalo Higua\u00edn on loan. If the latter arrives, \u00c1lvaro Morata could depart to San Siro in a similar arrangement. Yet the priority could be squad trimming, with Victor Moses, Gary Cahill and Danny Drinkwater likely to leave, and Tammy Abraham, currently on loan at Aston Villa, potentially also on the move. Dominic Fifield\nPalace have needed a natural goalscorer all season. They lack the budget to invest heavily mid-season but may be tempted to add another forward-thinking player, which would allow them to cancel Jordan Ayew\u2019s loan from Swansea and send out Alexander S\u00f8rloth for greater game-time. DF\nMarcel Brands, director of football, has stated this will be the quietest window for some time at Goodison. \u201cIt is not a goal to sell, it\u2019s not a goal to bring in new players,\u201d he said. The need for a quality striker and to secure Andr\u00e9 Gomes on a permanent deal is pressing, however. Andy Hunter\nFulham may have to cancel Timothy Fosu-Mensah\u2019s loan to bring in another temporary signing from the Premier League, but they will surely find money to spend on permanent deals, even after a vast summer outlay, given their desperation to stay up. They will be tempted to invest in Chelsea\u2019s potential rejects. Danny Drinkwater, after all, has flourished under Claudio Ranieri before. DF\nWith 12 goals in 20 league matches \u2013 and none from their centre-forwards \u2013 Huddersfield are crying out for players who can give them a cutting edge, starting with a clinical finisher. David Wagner has said they will do \u201ceverything we can\u201d to improve their attack. That may mean breaking the club\u2019s transfer record of \u00a317.5m. Paul Doyle\nLeicester will be looking to trim rather than add to their bloated and imbalanced squad, with Andy King and Adrien Silva, two of seven central midfielders, expected to depart. The out-of-favour Shinji Okazaki could move, too. The perennial question is where do they find a deputy for Jamie Vardy? SJ\nDespite repeated links to Christian Pulisic, J\u00fcrgen Klopp maintains he is unlikely to move in the market unless circumstances change and dictate otherwise. Liverpool were the biggest spenders in the summer as they built with a title challenge in mind and a healthy lead at new year has vindicated their planning. AH\nThe champions insist there will be no incomings, yet given the lack of competition to 33-year-old Fernandinho, another defensive midfielder would be welcomed by Pep Guardiola. Lyon\u2019s Tanguy Ndombele is one potential candidate \u2013 and his asking price of around \u00a355m is affordable. Left-back is another problem area; Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell may, again, be of interest. Jamie Jackson\nAs always there will be sizeable funds available. A centre-back is the prime requirement for interim manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, given the lack of clean sheets. Porto\u2019s \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, Tottenham\u2019s Toby Alderweireld, Leicester City\u2019s Harry Maguire and Napoli\u2019s Kalidou Koulibaly may be ideal but whether any can be prised away in the window is the challenge. JJ\nRafael Ben\u00edtez wants a playmaker \u2013 ideally Atlanta United\u2019s 24-year-old Paraguay international Miguel Almir\u00f3n \u2013 a left-back, a winger and an extra striker. Whether he gets any \u2013 or even one player on the list \u2013 remains to be seen. No one in and around the first-team squad is for sale. Louise Taylor\nSouthampton blew their modest budget on Mark Hughes\u2019s severance package and new manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, wants to trim the squad. He would listen to offers for C\u00e9dric Soares, Manolo Gabbiadini, Fraser Forster and Steven Davis. A new right-back and pace in the final third would be welcome. DH\nMauricio Pochettino resorted to mime when asked whether he would make any signings, turning his pocket inside out to indicate it was empty. Spurs have no money, as they wrestle with their \u00a31bn stadium project, and any incoming business would have to be funded by outgoings \u2013 Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 being one possibility. DH\nWatford do not intend to sell any members of their first-team squad but some peripheral players will be made available on loan, and they are open to making a small number of signings, in particular a central defender. They would like a proven goalscorer, but given salary constraints and with their need not desperate they may wait. Simon Burnton\nManuel Pellegrini spent heavily last summer but an injury crisis could force the manager to dip into the market again. Samir Nasri is set to join on a free and Pellegrini also wants more depth in central midfield. Gary Medel, the experienced Besiktas midfielder, could be available for a modest fee. Jacob Steinberg\nNuno Esp\u00edrito Santo gives nothing away about Wolves\u2019 transfer plans, but the club are known to be looking for another striker to provide competition and cover for Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez. Identifying the right players midway through a season, rather than coming up with the money, is the issue. SJ",

        "content": "The England and Saracens fly-half on how a degree course has helped him examine his mistakes and become calmer on the pitch\n\u201cThe thing I liked about it most,\u201d Owen Farrell says, \u201cwas having a look at yourself and what you\u2019re doing. Seeing and understanding how things happened.\u201d\nOn the verge of a new year, after a tumultuous 2018 in which he became England\u2019s captain amid the team losing five Tests in a row following a winning run of 18 games, Farrell reflects on his recently completed university degree rather than his crucial role in steadying a country\u2019s fluctuating rugby fortunes. Yet it is intriguing to hear Farrell investigate his analytical skills when so much of his game is built on fiery commitment and unyielding hardness.\nThis combination often boils over into brutal hits and battles with match officials. Yet Farrell remains England\u2019s most important player and their leader talisman with the World Cup nine months away. His degree in management and leadership, which included a 12,000-word essay on reflective learning, proves Farrell is more than just a fierce competitor. The 27-year-old appears determined to become a calmer player and a better leader.\nThe core attributes of his game will remain unchanged. England\u2019s coach, Eddie Jones, likes the controversial way Farrell hits people hard when he tackles. More importantly he seems to have settled on Farrell as England\u2019s fly-half, instead of inside-centre, and as the more important man in the co-captaincy role he shared with Dylan Hartley in the autumn. The hooker was dropped against Australia.\nFarrell is a guarded interviewee, even if we know each other a little and he is friendly and fun to chat to about other sports. But, after a year in which he got married, became England\u2019s co-captain and saw his dad, Andy, play a significant part in the rise of Irish rugby, Farrell\u2019s self-analysis should be welcomed. Did he learn much about himself? \u201cDefinitely. Not anything too new and drastic, just deeper understanding about everything you do.\u201d\nFarrell has always been a leader with the loudest voice on the training field and during games. Even when he made his Saracens debut, 11 days after turning 17 in 2008, Farrell expressed himself. Has he become even more vocal since becoming England\u2019s captain? \u201cNo. I hope I\u2019ve got better but I don\u2019t think the captaincy changes me much. I enjoy it \u2013 and I enjoyed that leadership stuff before the England co-captaincy.\u201d\nIt surely impacts on the way he deals with officials during a Test? Farrell smiles. \u201cI suppose it makes you a bit calmer. That\u2019s a good thing for me.\u201d\nFarrell was not very calm when, shortly after this interview, he fell out with the referee Tom Foley during Saracens\u2019 defeat by Exeter Chiefs on 22 December. He became frustrated and his characteristic on-field dialogue with the referee went awry. An irritated Foley snapped \u201cEnough\u201d before, in the second half, awarding a penalty against Farrell\u2019s backchat. Exeter\u2019s 31-13 win ended Saracens\u2019 22-game unbeaten run and meant they replaced Farrell\u2019s team as Premiership leaders.\nFarrell will still be a key player at the World Cup and he has matured. His exacting standards no longer automatically induce a glare or barked shout if a teammate makes an error.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot better at dropping emotions if something goes wrong, or right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to react authentically but a mistake is never a problem if the intentions are good. That feeling of being uptight or angry can\u2019t last.\u201d\nMost leaders, especially coaches and captains, find it difficult to switch off after a big game. Does Farrell also struggle? \u201cI\u2019m a lot better at it now than I was. It helps that I love thinking about the game. At the same time, when stuff doesn\u2019t go quite right and I get uptight I can carry it home.\u201d\n2018 was a difficult year for England. Having won successive Six Nations championships under Jones, including the grand slam in 2016, they finished second bottom last season \u2013 losing three consecutive matches. Farrell then captained England on their summer tour of South Africa where they lost the opening two Tests, having built clear leads in both games. They missed key players but England looked adrift. Since an improved autumn, when they won three out of four games, has Farrell been able to identify what went so wrong in that five-match slump?\n\u201cSometimes it can be about confidence. You lose a couple of tight ones and things get hard. Sometimes you can be too desperate to win games and therefore you play on the edge and do things you wouldn\u2019t normally do. Like the penalty count. Nobody wants to give penalties away but when your confidence is low, and you\u2019re a bit too desperate, you can\u2019t help but do that.\n\u201cBut when you get a couple of wins the confidence returns, probably without you knowing it. You trust [yourself] subconsciously that bit more..\u201d\nThis is the clearest sign that Farrell understands he needs to control himself while maintaining the searing intensity which makes him such a special player.\n\u201cConfidence can be elusive because you don\u2019t know you\u2019ve lost it,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can put your finger on. You don\u2019t go into a game thinking I\u2019m not confident. You always think you\u2019re going to win. But in big games, like the autumn, it comes down to fine margins.\u201d\nIt is easy to imagine that a driven Farrell would take defeat badly. \u201cThe initial reaction is yes. But the main thing for me is that a loss offers a lot. It probably shouldn\u2019t be this way but a loss probably opens more doors for you than a win. To really buy into something, and to take it to another level, you sometimes need a loss. We had that last year at Saracens when we lost seven on the bounce. We suffered a big loss in Europe against Leinster in a quarter-final but we opened up, came back strong and it allowed us to play like we did for the rest of the season. This season at Saracens we\u2019re taking that experience and making sure we don\u2019t get into a slump \u2013 and exploring where we can really go.\u201d\nFarrell will not say it out loud but Saracens, despite the Exeter defeat, aim to win both the Premiership and the Champions Cup. That regenerated optimism also seems to be surging through England as another Six Nations and the World Cup loom. \u201cDefinitely. We\u2019re excited. People are always going to drag it towards the World Cup and, of course, that\u2019s what everyone is aiming at. But we\u2019re looking at what we can do now to improve. We made good steps in the right direction in November, so we\u2019ve got to fight hard to keep doing that.\u201d\nThe memory lingers of Ireland looking imperious against England when sealing their grand slam last season at Twickenham. \u201cI don\u2019t remember feeling that,\u201d Farrell counters. \u201cI don\u2019t think we believed it had run away from us. Games can flip on their heads in a matter of minutes. The South Africa game in November is a good example. They were pretty dominant in the first half but we showed fight to stick in it and we got the win in the end.\u201d\nFarrell\u2019s contentious high tackle on Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen, carried out in desperate circumstances when England\u2019s confidence was fragile, happened then and South Africa were unlucky to lose 12-11. But a week later England suffered bad luck in a 16-15 defeat by New Zealand. Farrell stresses that his focus now is on the future.\nEngland\u2019s next game is a Six Nations opener in Dublin. The difficulty is made personal by Andy Farrell\u2019s presence as Ireland\u2019s defence coach \u2013 and he will become their head coach after the World Cup. Farrell Sr\u2019s defence work with Ireland and the Lions means his teams have lost only two out of the last six matches against New Zealand. His son tries to remain measured. \u201cHe will be the first person to tell you it\u2019s not just defence. It\u2019s about how the whole game joins up. Watching that last Ireland win against New Zealand was really impressive.\u201d\nHaving helped England to a stuttering victory over Japan that afternoon, Farrell watched Ireland beat the All Blacks on his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sitting down and watching it but I saw most of it \u2013 especially how exciting the game was.\u201d\nDoes Farrell now visualise how England might beat Ireland on 2 February \u2013 and set themselves up for a serious tilt at the 2019 World Cup? \u201cWe do our analysis and give full respect to the opposition,\u201d he says in an answer of fitting restraint. \u201cBut a lot of our preparation is about freeing ourselves up to enjoy the game. You really need to be relaxed and excited about playing. Not uptight and worried. When you\u2019re relaxed you are more decisive. It\u2019s not easy but we\u2019re learning all the time.\u201d",

        "content": "Regulations to ensure greater transparency come after string of shareholder revolts in 2018\nBritain\u2019s biggest listed companies will be forced to justify the pay gap between chief executives and their workforce as part of rules that come into force on New Year\u2019s Day.\nThe pay-ratio regulations are part of government efforts to improve transparency around executive remuneration. They follow a string of investor revolts in 2018 over high pay for senior executives at companies including Royal Mail, Persimmon and Unilever.\nBusinesses will have to divulge and justify the difference between executive salaries and average annual pay for employees. They will also need to explain how directors take staff and other stakeholder interests into account when they decide on salaries and bonuses.\nThe regulations will make it a statutory requirement for companies listed on the London Stock Exchange with more than 250 staff to disclose the ratio of chief executives\u2019 remuneration to the median pay of UK employees every year.\nPay for 2019 will be first under the microscope, which means the initial disclosures will be released in 2020.\nInvestors have been calling for more transparency around executive pay and how it aligns with salaries and bonuses across companies.\nPersimmon, a housebuilder, ousted its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, in November after a furore over his \u00a375m bonus. That package was honoured despite a shareholder revolt in April in which nearly 64% voted against the company\u2019s remuneration policy.\nMPs also hit out at the company for failing to pay the living wage to its lowest-paid workers. Persimmon, however, said it has signed up to pay the \u00a39 living wage starting in January 2019.\nRoyal Mail had one of the biggest shareholder revolts in UK corporate history in July. About 70% voted against its pay policy in light of an annual package for the chief executive, Rico Back, which was worth up to \u00a32.7m. This was on top of a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for having left the company\u2019s European subsidiary. Unilever, AA and Cineworld also experienced investor backlashes over director pay in 2018.\nLuke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said the rules were a step in the right direction. \u201cGovernment policy is overwhelmingly focused on supporting business, on the basis that successful businesses benefit wider society,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut too many companies lavish excessive pay awards on their top executives while holding down pay for low and middle-income earners, meaning that the full potential benefits of business success go unrealised.\n\u201cPutting information about pay ratios in the public domain won\u2019t instantly eradicate injustice, but it will give investors, workers and other stakeholders a better insight into the fairness of company pay practices.\u201d\nThe business secretary, Greg Clark, stressed that most companies in Britain act responsibly.\n\u201cWe do, however, understand the frustration of workers and shareholders when executive pay is out of step with performance, and their concerns are not heard,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe regulations coming into force today will build on our reputation by increasing transparency and boosting accountability at the highest level \u2013 giving workers a stronger dialogue and voice in the boardroom and ensuring businesses are accountable for their executive pay.\u201d",

        "content": "Politics, science, technology, TV, books \u2026 here\u2019s what to expect in the year ahead\nA year is much more than just 365 days, or one orbit of the Earth around the sun. One year produces so many events and human stories that in 2018 alone, the Guardian published more than 73,000 news articles.\nMuch of what happens is unpredictable. But with 2019 only hours old, there are a few things that can confidently be foretold.\nBrexit may be clear as mud, but if it\u2019s making you queasy then here are a few fixed political points in the year to steady the balance.\nIt\u2019s a busy year for elections, with four of the world\u2019s most populous democracies holding votes.\nEurope holds parliamentary elections from 23-26 May to elect 705 new MEPs. Watch closely to see how well the populist far-right does. It\u2019s been gaining ground across the continent, but will the attentions of Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart and the Trump White house, help or hinder?\nBefore that, Nigerians head to the polls in February. Sitting president Muhammadu Buhari faces a record 78 opposition candidates, some of whom accuse him of failing to deal adequately with corruption.\nFollowing an illness earlier this year and five months spent recuperating in London, there have also been bizarre suggestions that he has been replaced by a body double. That would certainly make campaigning in the world\u2019s seventh most populous country easier.\nOther major democracies going to the polls include India, where Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, and Indonesia, where the one-term incumbent faces a challenge from yet another rightwing populist candidate.\nSpeaking of rightwing populists, Brazil\u2019s newly elected and controversial president Jair Bolsonaro takes office on 1 January. Other notable votes take place in Thailand (February), South Africa (May), Argentina (October) and Canada (October).\nAnd finally, in Japan, Emperor Akihito will abdicate in April owing to health concerns after heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. This will be the first time a Japanese emperor has abdicated in two centuries.\nThe last time France hosted the G7 summit of the world\u2019s most industrialised nations in 2011, migration was a fringe issue, Emmanuel Macron was a little-known investment banker and the riots were happening across the channel in the UK.\nThis time around, President Macron will welcome his peers to Biarritz in August. Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged \u20ac500m (\u00a3452m) of funding, and migration.\nThe G7\u2019s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June. Founded after the financial crash of 2008, the summit promotes cooperation and a focus on global financial markets. The G20 has been criticised for becoming \u201ca stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home\u201d. According to the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Phillip Inman, this year\u2019s version will be \u201cincreasingly hampered by Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies\u201d.\nAnother year means another COP \u2013 the abbreviation for the annual UN climate summits that warn, with increasing severity, how imperilled we are by our carbon addiction. Alas, this year\u2019s host, Brazil, has pulled out owing to \u201cbudget restrictions\u201d. If the summit goes ahead, discussion will surely centre on Trump\u2019s continued disavowal of the Paris agreement, and a review of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development goals, four years on from their implementation.\nThe Women Deliver conference, which is held once every two years on women\u2019s equality and gender rights, will take place in June in Canada, with Justin Trudeau billed to speak \u2013 the first time a sitting leader of a country has done so.\nAs 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first world war armistice, so 2019 will see the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, the formal end of the conflict. It is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Nato, the collective defence pact originally set up to \u201ckeep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down\u201d.\nThe internet is poised to pass a notable milestone meanwhile, with predictions that the number of global users will pass the 50% mark in 2019. In the US, for the first time ever the population will have more people older than age 60 than younger than age 18.\nIn births and deaths, 2019 is the 500th anniversary of the death of original renaissance man Leonardo Da Vinci and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria. It also marks the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook reaching New Zealand, and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro.\nThis year will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s moon landing. No human has been back since 1972. Perhaps a moment to rekindle interest in our cosmological outrider.\nThe year will also see the first private spacecraft from SpaceX and Boeing take crews to the International Space Station. There will also be the first images of a black hole from the Event Horizon telescope, and the first results from the ESA\u2019s Trace Gas Orbiter probe, which is circling Mars to work out if methane plumes are due to life on the planet.\nBack on Earth, the landmark agreement to redefine the kilogram will come into place in May. Rather than being tied to a lump of metal stored in a Parisian vault, the new definition will be a reflection of Planck\u2019s constant, a number rooted in the quantum world. The weight is over.\n2019 could see the first birth in the UK of a baby with DNA from three parents. The process of mitochondrial transfer was legalised in Britain in 2015 and Professor Alison Murdoch has since been pioneering the technique in Newcastle, with the first woman selected to take part in the process this year.\nJohn Vary, a futurologist at John Lewis\u2019s Innovation Labs, notes some broader, science fiction-style developments which may also intrigue us in 2019.\n\u201cIn 2019, we could reach a point where customers can share their DNA with shops so that retailers can tailor products to a customer\u2019s genetics or ancestry,\u201d he predicts. \u201cWaitrose & Partners is piloting DnaNudge, an app which will use shoppers\u2019 DNA to help them make healthier choices while food shopping. Another example is OME Health, which offers health plans built on a person\u2019s gut microbiome, genetics blood markers and other health data.\u201d\nDespite 2019 being the Chinese year of the pig \u2013 a symbol that denotes wealth \u2013 in the western world there may be an economic downturn ahead. According to economics editor Phillip Inman: \u201cA recession looms in the UK, Europe and the US. It is possible once the impact of slowing growth in China and rising interest rates are put together, since most of the momentum after the financial crash of 2008 was based on cheap borrowing and the rapid expansion of Chinese trade. Without these two essential elements, the major economies are heading for trouble. Most doomsayer analysts consider 2020 a more likely year for a slump, with the seeds sown in 2019 by poor policy making.\u201d\nThe World Bank is predicting a global slowdown in 2019, as the stimulative impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts wane in the US and China is forced to restrict borrowing by state and private businesses.\nCentral banks are also poised to tighten monetary policies. \u201cThe US Federal Reserve is due to increase interest rates at least twice in 2019,\u201d Inman says. \u201cIt is also expected to further unwind its quantitative easing policy. An increase in the cost of borrowing is already hitting the US housing market which is reaching levels of distress last seen in the run up to the 2008 financial crash.\u201d\nThe World Trade Organisation could be unableto judge trade disputes between countries in 2019. When he took office, Donald Trump blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO to replace retirees, leaving a large number of vacancies. The WTO needs a minimum number of legal experts to judge cases and could be inquorate as early as spring 2019.\nThere will be no shortage of new technological releases in 2019. Samsung is due to launch follow-ups to its critically acclaimed Galaxy S and Note series, while Apple will be announcing a new iPhone in September, and Google the Pixel 4 phone in October.\nAmazon will be announcing new products in September, likely to be iterations of its home management Echo devices, and Apple will unveil new Macs and tablets in October. In terms of tech developments, the Guardian\u2019s assistant technology editor Samuel Gibbs predicts that the biggest advance will come in the form of flexible screens in 2019.\nFuturologist John Vary adds that the voice search enabled by products such as Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Alexa will develop to \u201cenable people to find items however they describe them and in any language\u201d. While augmented reality could enhance personalised shopping to mean \u201csmart home tech could act as your own shopper, alerting retailers in advance when you\u2019re looking for a product,\u201d he says.\nWith Channel 4 moving to new headquarters in Leeds in 2019, the Guardian\u2019s TV editor, Lanre Bakare, picks the fourth season of comedy Catastrophe and Brexit: The Uncivil War, as ones to watch on the channel next year. Catastrophe tells the story of a couple raising a child conceived in a one night stand. The two-hour Brexit drama meanwhile stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, and is based on first-hand accounts of the campaigns leading up to Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016.\nFurther recommendations include big-budget sequels \u2013 the final season of fantasy thriller Game of Thrones, airing on Sky Atlantic in April. There\u2019s also the third season of the brooding American noir True Detective in January. Moonlight Oscar winner Mahershala Ali takes the lead from season two\u2019s Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Finally, everyone\u2019s favourite local Norwich radio presenter returns to the BBC with a satirical take on a live talk show in February on This Time \u2026 With Alan Partridge.\nOn the big screen there is a volley of new releases to look out for. With 2018 being a record-breaking year for box office takings, major studios will be hoping to replicate their success with a slate of blockbusters: a live-action Lion King in July, Captain Marvel in May \u2013 the franchise\u2019s first female-led film \u2013 Toy Story 4 in June, Terminator 6 and Frozen 2 in November, and the final instalment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars IX, in December.\nThe Guardian\u2019s film editor Catherine Shoard\u2019s picks include King\u2019s Speech director Tom Hooper\u2019s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats, starring Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. There is also the Downton Abbey movie; Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, starring Godfathers Al Pacino and Robert De Niro; Get Out director Jordan Peele\u2019s latest horror, Us; an adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s novel The Goldfinch starring Nicole Kidman; and Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women, starring 2018\u2019s newcomer Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\nValued at more than $93bn, the games industry almost doubles the revenue of the international film industry, and the Guardian\u2019s games editor Keza MacDonald has some selections for 2019. Keza picks out Harry Potter Go, made by the creators of Pok\u00e9mon Go, as \u201canother potential world-conquering mobile game\u201d, she says, this time based on the Harry Potter universe. There is also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice \u2013 a horror samurai game from the director of Dark Souls, \u201cone of the best games of the decade\u201d, according to MacDonald; and The Last of Us Part 2, an \u201cintense, cinematic game about a survivor of a world-decimating outbreak \u2013 far from the usual boring zombie story\u201d.\nAdele by Leila Slimani (February)One of the runaway bestsellers of 2016 was Slimani\u2019s Lullaby, a chilling tale of a homicidal immigrant nanny, and Slimani hopes to continue this success with a new novel telling the story of a sex-addicted Parisian journalist.\nBlack Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James (February)Marlon James releases the follow-up to his Man Booker Prize-winning 2015 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings. With Black Leopard, James creates an imaginary ancient world built on African mythology to tell the story of a hunter tracking a lost child. It is the first in a new trilogy, Dark Star.\nThe Liar by Ayelet Gundar-Goshen (March)Israeli author Gundar-Goshen pens her third novel on a teenage girl who accuses an older minor celebrity of sexual assault. A fictionalised tale building on the #MeToo movement of 2017-18.\nThe Other Americans by Laila Lalami (March)Pulitzer prize finalist Lalami writes a novel charting the American immigrant experience through the eyes of a Moroccan family living in California. It is already earning praise from the likes of JM Coetzee.\nClear Bright Future by Paul Mason (April)Journalist Paul Mason follows up on 2016\u2019s Postcapitalism, which formulated a collapse of capitalism as we know it, with a theorisation of what makes us human and how we are still capable of changing the future.\nThe Heartland by Nathan Filer (April)Former mental health nurse Nathan Filer publishes his second book, a collection of first-person encounters and essays on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "content": "Previously churches were protected from being sued by a legal precedent which said they did not legally exist\nVictims of sexual abuse can finally sue the Catholic church in New South Wales after the state government abolished the infamous \u201cEllis defence\u201d.\nIn October the NSW parliament passed laws to allow survivors to seek justice and sue unincorporated organisations, including churches, following recommendations by the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nThe laws came into effect on 1 January and are retrospective, allowing past victims to seek justice.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased my first item of business in 2019 is to condemn the \u2018Ellis defence\u2019 to the scrapheap and create a fairer civil litigation system for all child abuse survivors,\u201d the NSW attorney general, Mark Speakman, said.\n\u201cThis means all survivors of institutional child abuse in NSW will now have the same access to compensation through civil litigation, no matter what kind of organisation is responsible.\u201d\nPreviously, churches were protected from being sued by a legal precedent which said a church, the assets of which are held in a trust, could not be sued because it did not legally exist.\nThe precedent was set when the Catholic church won a legal battle against John Ellis, a former altar boy who was sexually abused at the age of 13 by the former Bass Hill parish priest Father Aidan Duggan.\nEllis sued Duggan, the trustees of the Roman Catholic church for the archdiocese of Sydney, and Cardinal George Pell, but the NSW court of appeal found Pell and the trustees were not proper defendants in the proceedings. It ruled the trustees didn\u2019t control Duggan and weren\u2019t responsible for his conduct, and couldn\u2019t be sued.\nPell is born in the Victorian town of Ballarat.\nPell returns as a parish priest to Ballarat, where abuse is widespread.\u00a0\nPell\u00a0lives with the paedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale.\nPell supports Ridsdale at a court appearance for child sex offences. Ridsdale is eventually convicted of abusing more than 60 children.\nPell is appointed archbishop of Melbourne. He introduces the Melbourne Response, which offers counselling to victims of sexual abuse but caps compensation payments.\u00a0\nPell is appointed archbishop of Sydney.\u00a0\nPope John Paul II appoints Pell a cardinal.\nThe Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, announces the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.\nPell is appointed the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the Vatican\u2019s treasurer.\u00a0\nPell appears before the royal commission for the first time.\u00a0\nPell appears again in Melbourne, where he likens the church\u2019s responsibility for child abuse to that of a \u201ctrucking company\u201d whose driver had sexually assaulted a hitch-hiker.\u00a0\u00a0\nPell gives evidence to the royal commission via videolink from Rome. He denies he had any knowledge at the time of Ridsdale's offending. He says once he did find out, it was\u00a0a \u201csad story\u201d but \u201cnot of much interest\u201d to him.\nAustralian detectives interview Pell in Rome about child sexual abuse allegations. Pell dismisses them as \u201cabsolute and disgraceful rubbish\u201d.\u00a0\nPell is charged with multiple sexual offences.\nPell is ordered to stand trial over multiple allegations. The details may not be reported at this time for legal reasons. Pell says he will plead not guilty. The charges are to be split into two trials. The first relates to allegations that Pell sexually abused two choirboys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in 1996 and 1997. The second relates to allegations Pell molested boys at the Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s.\nProsecutors request a suppression order, later approved, which bars reporting of the trials.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe jury in the first trial fails to reach a verdict. A mistrial is declared.\nThe jury in the retrial finds Pell guilty on all charges.\u00a0\nProsecutors drop the swimming pool charges after the judge rules certain evidence is inadmissible. The suppression order on the first trial is lifted.\nChief judge calls Pell\u2019s crimes \u2018breathtakingly arrogant\u2019 as he sentences Pell to six years in jail, with non-parole period of three years and eight months\u00a0\nPell's appeal against his conviction for child sex abuse is dismissed by the Victorian court of appeal. The three-judge court of appeal dismissed Pell\u2019s first grounds for appeal \u2013 that the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty \u2013 by a margin of two to one. The other two grounds of appeal were dismissed unanimously. He will remain in jail until at least October 2022.\nDuggan died in 2004, soon after proceedings commenced, and Ellis was left with no one to sue over the abuse he suffered.\nUnder the new laws an institution must now identify a defendant with sufficient assets to pay any potential claim, or have the court appoint associated trustees who can access trust property.\n\u201cWe are now going to see a pathway to justice for survivors of abuse that they haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, long battle.\u201d\nHe told the ABC he had felt a sense of responsibility because his case put it \u201cin black and white\u201d that the church could not be sued, but in the years since, and particularly during the royal commission, he felt very supported.\nThe survivor advocacy and support group Care Leavers Australasia Network welcomed the change and thanked Ellis. However, it also noted many survivors were \u201ctoo old [and] frail to sue\u201d over abuse from decades ago.\nThe NSW legislation also established statutory liabilities for child abuse, which the NSW justice department said would \u201cestablish more fair and certain avenues for survivors to pursue civil action\u201d.\n\u201cIt is also to encourage institutions to do everything they can to prevent the abuse from occurring in the first place.\u201d\nThe new laws stipulate a duty of care on organisations which exercise care, supervision or authority over children, to prevent abuse perpetrated by individuals associated with it. It reverses the onus of proof onto institutions, requiring they prove they took reasonable steps to prevent abuse.\nIt also extends vicarious liability to cover abusers who are not employees but whose relationship with the organisation is \u201cakin to employment\u201d.\nVictoria passed laws to close the legal loophole in May. In June Western Australia became the final state to sign up to a national redress scheme.",

Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.\u201d\nWarren, 69, is entering what is likely to be a crowded Democratic primary field seeking to take on Donald Trump. Those considering bids include a slew of fellow senators such as Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, the former vice-president, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nIn her four and a half minute announcement video, Warren stressed the economic populist message that has brought her to national prominence.\nShe mixed old family photos with charts showing the declining middle-class share of income and the gap between black and white household wealth, and discussed her upbringing in Oklahoma and her family\u2019s struggle to make ends meet after her father had a heart attack that left him unable to work.\n\u201cWorking families today face a lot tougher path than my family did,\u201d she said. \u201cOur government\u2019s supposed to work for all of us, but instead it has become a tool for the wealthy and well-connected.\u201d\nWarren did not mention Trump by name in the video, but it showed images of him along with allies Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon and Fox News personalities Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. The video says: \u201cThe whole scam is propped up by an echo chamber of fear and hate designed to distract and divide us \u2013 people who will do or say anything to hang on to power.\u201d\nEvery person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, & take care of themselves & the people they love. That\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for, & that\u2019s why I\u2019m launching an exploratory committee for president. I need you with me: https://t.co/BNl2I1m8OX pic.twitter.com/uXXtp94EvY\nWarren, a former law professor, gained prominence for her critique of Wall Street after the 2008 financial crash, and proposed what became the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She ran for the Senate in 2012, defeating incumbent Republican Scott Brown.\nAs a senator, she has proposed legislation to overhaul the way corporations operate, requiring them to obtain government charters to operate and consider their public\u2019s interests rather than just those of their shareholders. She gained fans for standing up to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor, turning his admonishment of her \u2013 \u201cNevertheless, she persisted\u201d \u2013 into a slogan.\nBut Warren has suffered significant missteps as well, and become a favorite target for conservative critics who paint her as the the epitome of the east coast, academic liberal elite they often disparage.\nShe drew criticism for the release of a DNA test intended to prove her Native American heritage, which offended some Native American groups and led to doubts about her political acumen. The Cherokee nation secretary of state, Chuck Hoskin Jr, called her move \u201cinappropriate and wrong\u201d and said: \u201cSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201d\nShe is also a favorite target of Trump, whose taunts calling her \u201cPocahontas\u201d prompted the DNA test. He has also labeled her \u201cGoofy Elizabeth Warren\u201d.\n Commenting on Warren\u2019s 2020 announcement in an interview with Fox News, set to air late on New Year\u2019s Eve, Trump said he would \u201clove to run against her\u201d. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well.\u201d\nEven in her heavily Democratic home state, Warren is a polarizing figure. The editorial board of the Boston Globe, noting that she won re-election with fewer votes than Republican Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker, encouraged her not to run for president.\n\u201cThose are warning signs from the voters who know her best,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cWhile Warren is an effective and impactful senator with an important voice nationally, she has become a divisive figure. A unifying voice is what the country needs now after the polarizing politics of Donald Trump.\u201d\nAt a press conference Monday afternoon near her Cambridge home where she was joined by her husband and dog, Warren brushed off concerns she could be too polarizing to be elected.\n\u201cWhen we show \u2013 not just tell, but show \u2013 what Democrats can get out there and make happen, I think that\u2019s how we win,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem we\u2019ve got right now in Washington is that works great for those who\u2019ve got money to buy influence, and I\u2019m fighting against that, and you bet that\u2019s going to make a lot of people unhappy.\u201d\nForming an exploratory committee will allow Warren to begin raising money for the presidential campaign. In past campaigns, she has had success raising small-dollar donations.\nTrump has said he would welcome a run against Warren. \u201cI hope she\u2019s running for president, because I think she\u2019d be very easy,\u201d he said in October. \u201cI hope that she is running. I do not think she\u2019d be difficult at all. She\u2019ll destroy the country. She\u2019ll make our country into Venezuela.\u201d\nAmong progressive groups, reaction on Monday was positive.\n\u201cSenator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s formal entrance into the 2020 race for president today helps launch what we believe will be a vibrant discussion of bold, inclusive populist ideas in the Democratic primary, and we look forward to the wide array of progressive candidates that we expect to join her in it in the year ahead,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, the Democracy for America executive director.",

The government plans to establish \u201cexclusion zones\u201d to move any protests away from clinics.\nThe rollout will mark another milestone in the Republic of Ireland\u2019s transformation from a conservative society in thrall to the Roman Catholic church to a liberal, secular country, and will increase the pressure to lift Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion ban, an anomaly in the UK.\n\u201cThe fact it has been turned around so quickly is brilliant,\u201d said Clare Murphy, a spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which catered to many of the approximately 3,000 women who travelled from Ireland to Britain last year to obtain abortions. \u201cThat number will definitely drop, without a doubt.\u201d\nThe referendum last May delivered a mandate for change: 66.4% of voters chose to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution, which gave \u201cthe unborn\u201d equal rights to pregnant women and made abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest or severe danger to the mother.\nSince then, Ireland\u2019s health minister, Simon Harris, has driven a tight timetable, steering legislation through contentious, marathon debates in parliament and negotiating with medical service providers.\nThe Irish president, Michael Higgins, signed the regulation of termination of pregnancy bill into law on 20 December, paving the way for services to open in January. Campaigners have hailed it as an overdue breakthrough for women\u2019s rights and equality.\nUnder the new system, GPs will provide abortions to women up to nine weeks pregnant and hospitals will perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, abortions will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The service will be largely free, with the state paying GPs approximately \u20ac400 per patient.\nAs the rollout nears, all sides are apprehensive. Pro-choice groups criticised a mandatory three-day \u201ccooling off\u201d period for women who request abortions, calling it a sop to anti-abortion activists that lacked any medical basis. They also worry about uncertainty over those seeking abortions after 12 weeks, estimated in about 17% of cases.\n\u201cWe expect there will be a significant cohort of women who won\u2019t be catered for,\u201d said Murphy. She expected hundreds of such cases to end up in British clinics this year.\nAnti-abortion advocates have been dismayed, saying the referendum was not a mandate for abortion on demand. Brendan Leahy, the bishop of Limerick, said Ireland was experiencing an \u201cinglorious watermark\u201d.\nDoctors, nurses, counsellors and administrators worry about bottlenecks and confusion in a health service already creaking from dysfunction and long waiting lists.\nA 24-hour, seven-day helpline will direct women to local GPs who provide abortions. Concern about teething problems has deterred many GPs from signing up to abortion services.\nAn online consultation by the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) found that 43% were unwilling because of concerns about the rollout, especially \u201creferral pathways\u201d to secondary care involving ultrasound and hospital services.\nTony Cox, the ICGP\u2019s medical director, said: \u201cA small but significant group, particularly younger GPs, see the introduction of abortion services as a significant milestone for women\u2019s health services in Ireland.\n\u201cWe believe the majority of members are concerned that the introduction has been rushed, that the referral pathways won\u2019t be in place for a while, but are optimistic that it will settle down and that the media interest will subside, and the 24-hour helpline will work smoothly.\u201d",

        "content": "Palestinian leaders have rejected Washington as a mediator and Israeli politicians openly deride peace efforts\nAfter two years of drum-rolling, Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cultimate deal\u201d for Israelis and Palestinians is about to enter what its architects claim is the pre-launch phase.\nThe US president has said the peace plan drawn up by his team \u2013 two former personal lawyers and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner \u2013 will be ready to unveil by the end of January.\nYet despite the anticipation surrounding Trump\u2019s proposals for resolving one of the world\u2019s most intractable conflicts, a more crucial plan for the region is already being implemented on the ground: an attempt to strengthen Israel\u2019s hand while weakening that of the Palestinians.\nOne by one, the US has implemented the key demands of Israel\u2019s hardline rightwing lobby, drastically slashing humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, declaring the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, shuttering Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington, and closing its own consulate that serves the occupied West Bank and Gaza.\nFor Palestinians \u2013 and many Israelis \u2013 a peace deal is a sideshow. The bigger issue, which does not depend on peace, is the implementation of Israel\u2019s wishes by the most accommodating US administration in its history.\nTrump has repeatedly said the measures are intended to force Palestinian leaders \u2013 who reject him outright as a biased mediator \u2013 into a peace effort. Trump has also said Israel will have to \u201cpay a price\u201d for peace, although has not specified what that would be.\nPalestinian leaders have responded by saying there is no genuine plan for a just solution. \u201cIt\u2019s really a lie,\u201d said Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian politician. \u201cEverybody is working on this fictitious concept. [The US] became partners with Israel and they are implementing Israeli policies. All we see are unilateral measures by the US and by Israel \u2026 The reality on the ground is now being engineered.\u201d\nA state department official said a \u201chigh priority\u201d has been placed on achieving a comprehensive deal, but it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d. While they would not comment on details of the plan, which is still being drafted, a few aspects are becoming clearer.\nFirst, unlike previous US-led efforts in which it was up to the Israelis and the Palestinians to decide the details, the Trump version will likely be much more specific and prescriptive. In essence, it will be a series of suggestions that detractors say will be heavily focused on Israeli demands based on the political views of its authors.\nFor example, Jason Greenblatt, who is leading Trump\u2019s team after his promotion to government from chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, has broken US precedent to say Israeli settlement-building in the occupied West Bank \u2013 illegal under international law \u2013 is not an obstacle to peace.\nThe US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who also worked for Trump\u2019s company, has been even more vocal in his support of Israeli settlement construction, and even the annexation of Palestinian territory.\nSecond, the US will only go so far in pushing the two sides to accept the deal, meaning the plan is liable to collapse. \u201cThe parties will need to decide if they think the plan works for them and will make their lives better,\u201d Greenblatt has said. \u201cThe parties are the only ones who can make these compromises.\u201d\nCritics say it is increasingly apparent that those drafting the plan might not even be betting on its success to achieve their goals, which are already being enforced on the ground.\nTrump\u2019s team will know that from Israel\u2019s perspective there is very little appetite for peace compared with the past. An August poll found only 9% of Israelis wanted their government to prioritise reaching a deal with the Palestinians in 2019.\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is acutely aware of public sentiment as an election approaches, has said he does not see \u201cany urgency\u201d on Trump revealing his peace plan. His former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman was even clearer when asked about a peace deal that could result in Palestinian self-rule: \u201cI don\u2019t care about a Palestinian state,\u201d he said. The justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, said she would tell Trump the plan was \u201ca waste of time\u201d.\nA European diplomat in Jerusalem told the Guardian on condition of anonymity that it was \u201cdistinctly possible that we could get to the end of Trump\u2019s presidency with no [peace] proposals\u201d.\nWith few predicting success, Palestinians are presented with two options: accepting a plan drafted by the least receptive US administration to their cause since peace efforts began, or continuing to face punitive measures. If the plan is rejected out of hand, the status quo \u2013 in which Israel entrenches its occupation of the West Bank and continues to enforce a blockade on Gaza \u2013 will remain.\nHowever, US officials insist that there are genuine peace efforts. The three main architects \u2013 Greenblatt, Friedman and Jared Kushner \u2013 all come from a business background and their position has been to treat the conflict like a deal. With economic incentives they hope to convince a side that has historically prioritised issues of principle, such as the right of refugees to return to their homes or to call Jerusalem their capital.\n\u201cThere is no reason the Palestinians (in both the West Bank and Gaza) can\u2019t enjoy economic success and integrate into a thriving regional economy \u2013 if they let us help,\u201d the trio wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in July.\nTrump also sees any negotiations as transactional, saying he has to force the Palestinians to reach an agreement by weakening their hand through aid cuts. The president referred to his Jerusalem declaration as a bargaining \u201cchip\u201d taken away from the Palestinians.\nIn a message sent a year ago to other senior officials on cutting funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, Kushner wrote in internal emails obtained by Foreign Policy: \u201cOur goal can\u2019t be to keep things stable and as they are \u2026 Sometimes you have to strategically risk breaking things in order to get there.\u201d\nShortly after Greenblatt was appointed last year, Tania Hary, the executive director at Gisha, an Israeli non-profit that promotes the freedom of movement of Palestinians, said her office started receiving calls from his team asking questions on the economy in Gaza, which has been kept under an Israel blockade for a decade.\nGreenblatt does not cite the blockade as a reason for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, but focuses blame on its rulers, Hamas, and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, which has blocked funding to the enclave.\n\u201cMy impression at the time was that I was being approached by business-minded people who thought they could solve a problem from a business perspective,\u201d Hary said.\n\u201cThey recognised that there were obstacles to growth that included restrictions on movement and access,\u201d she said, adding that her advice was that Gaza\u2019s problems cannot be solved by keeping it isolated from the West Bank and Israel.\nBut then they stopped calling. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that [message] carried through.\u201d",

        "content": "Party faces its greatest challenge as new generation urges change from corruption of the past\nIn a few months time, as winter begins to bite in the southern hemisphere, the African National Congress will face its biggest challenge since it took power in South Africa\u2019s first free elections a quarter of a century ago.\nThe 25-year milestone will be loudly celebrated. There will be rallies and speeches. The liberation songs that motivated ANC activists during the long, dark decades of its struggle to free South Africa from the racist, repressive apartheid regime will ring out. The memory of Nelson Mandela, Nobel prize laureate, freedom fighter and the country\u2019s secular saint, will be invoked.\nBut none of this will disguise the harsh reality that 2019 could be the year that will be seen by historians as the beginning of the end for the ANC.\n\u201cTwenty-five years is the time when the clock really starts ticking for liberation movements. The ANC is on the defensive now. It is just trying to stop the losses,\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, a South African commentator and analyst.\nThe general election likely in May or June will be the litmus test for the party.\nLast December, Cyril Ramaphosa, 66, won a close-run internal party election. Three months later, he ousted Jacob Zuma to take power as president of the country.\nZuma was accused of presiding over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the exchequer and damaged the reputation of the ANC beyond repair. Ramaphosa served as deputy president under Zuma.\nDetails of alleged graft are surfacing every week as journalists and a judicial inquiry unpick his era.\nThough Ramaphosa told reporters in November there was \u201ca new confidence, a new hope in the ANC\u201d and insisted \u201cthe shine that had been tarnished is coming back\u201d, the former trade union activist turned tycoon turned politician has struggled to overcome the toxic legacy of Zuma\u2019s nine-year rule.\nThe economy is weak, expectations are high and Ramaphosa\u2019s broadly centrist market-oriented policies face strong opposition from within his own party.\nEntrenched networks of government and ANC officials still loyal to Zuma remain powerful, while international investors, though interested by South Africa\u2019s undoubted potential, are wary.\nSuccessive ANC governments have made huge efforts to build homes and supply basic services to millions of people, but they have been unable to meet expectations. Many people still live without electricity or sanitation. Schooling and healthcare are often rudimentary. One recent survey found eight out of 10 nine-year-olds in South Africa are functionally illiterate. Levels of violent crime are among the highest in the world, with poor South Africans suffering most.\nRamaphosa\u2019s long stint in office under Zuma, and his failure to enact dramatic reform since taking power, leaves him and the ANC vulnerable to the charge from opposition parties that nothing has changed from the bad days before.\nSouth Africa remains a country with enormous resources and great wealth but also vast inequality.\nMuch of the focus in the last year was on the possible redistribution of farmland \u2013 largely owned by white people, who constitute fewer than 10% of the population.\n\u201cThe ANC is basically buying time. If you want to continue for another 30 years by fair not foul means you do need structural reform and land is one of those,\u201d said Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at the Chatham House thinktank in London.\nThe coming elections could see the ANC share of the vote fall close to 50% for the first time. \u201cThe ANC should get a weak majority but this may be the last election it wins,\u201d said Mathekga.\nHowever, the party will be helped by the relative weakness of the opposition. Ramaphosa\u2019s relative moderation has squeezed the political space once occupied by the Democratic Alliance, a centre-right, business-friendly party that is the ANC\u2019s main competitor. The belligerent rhetoric and populist policies of the radical Economic Freedom Fighters plays well with its core constituency but makes further expansion difficult.\nLeaders of the EFF have also been hit by damaging allegations that they benefited from the corrupt looting of a bank which held savings of some of the poorest members of society.\nSouth Africa, with its particularly traumatic history of racial repression and its high level of industrialisation, has always been something of an exception on the continent. But the country of 55 million people still follows many trends that are evident elsewhere.\nLast year the strength of a new wave of young politicians and activists challenging ageing leaders across much of Africa became evident.\nThe new generation of politicians are in their mid-30s and can barely remember the cold war or the conflicts that brought many autocrats or ruling parties \u2013 including the ANC \u2013 to power. Often educated and urban, they and their supporters are at the intersection of seismic demographic, social and economic shifts.\nMore than 10 million eligible voters in South Africa \u2013 about a quarter of the electorate \u2013 will be under 30 and thus too young to remember the ANC\u2019s role in the struggle against apartheid. A rising proportion live in towns and cities, not the rural zones that are the bedrock of ANC support.\n\u201cAll over \u2026 Africa, urban areas are in the forefront of moving away from the established parties, said Vines.",

They have been the subject of the second longest-running survey for any species, with detailed records going back almost a century. In 1928 there were 4,000 pairs in England and Wales, while in 2015 the figure for all Britain was 11,124.\nHerons have more than doubled their population partly as a result of remarkable versatility. Fish are the obvious dietary staple but mammals \u2013 rats, voles and moles included \u2013 are more than routine, as are snakes, lizards, frogs and birds\u2019 eggs. Adult birds have been seen to eat anything from robins and starlings to wood pigeons and mallards. There was correspondence in last January\u2019s edition of Birdwatch describing a heron at Rainham Marshes, in Essex, attacking and killing a member of its own species. The same letter referred to them recently killing and trying to devour little grebes and coots.\nI\u2019ve seen a good cross-section of this adaptability but never, until this day, had I witnessed the following technique. At Rockland Staithe there are a couple of tall metal posts at least 2m above the high-tide waterline. A heron is a habitual occupant of the tiny village quay, where the posts serve as a strategic perch to watch for possible titbits from local fishermen.\nI noticed this individual heron hop and raise its wings, with knees bent low to the post, as if it felt itself threatened. Instead of flying off, however, it angled its dagger-bill at the water below the perch and then, as an oarsman might shove off a boat, it pressed forward and down, hitting the water like a huge kingfisher. There was a split second when it sat at the surface riding its own brief swell. Then the heron, with a nice-sized roach in its beak, rose once more. The long hackles at its neck swayed with the force of the action. Diamond drops cascaded everywhere from the black-fringed cloak of its wings, which now rose and fell like bellows and, with long legs trailing way below, the heron regained its iron post to feed. I timed it all at under 15 seconds.",

        "content": "The CEO sets himself a personal challenge every new year. But after a bruising 12 months, what should he do next? \nWhen Mark Zuckerberg began his annual \u201cpersonal challenges\u201d in 2009, he set the bar pretty low: he dressed like an adult every day for a year. Subsequent challenges were squarely in the realm of achievable New Year\u2019s resolutions, from reading a book every two weeks and running a mile a day to starting to learn Mandarin and sending thank you notes.\nBut as Zuckerberg has transitioned his public image from the kid cosplaying as a business executive to the no-longer-quite-a-kid cosplaying as a statesman, his personal challenges have become something of a bellwether for how he is thinking about Facebook\u2019s future. In 2016, when it seemed that Facebook\u2019s challenges were still largely technological, he set out to build his own smart home system. In 2017, when political polarization was still being chalked up to filter bubbles, he embarked on a road trip around the US. And in 2018, when fake news and foreign interference were dominating headlines, he promised to buckle down and \u201cfocus on fixing\u201d all of the various \u201cissues\u201d that had left the one-time prodigy looking more and more like a pariah.\nTwelve months later, it seems that for the first time, Zuckerberg has failed to meet his goal. Not only has he not fixed Facebook, the list of problems with the social network has grown so long that it\u2019s getting harder to find people who think the company is even fixable.\nSo this year, we asked a number of writers, technologists, politicians, activists and comedians to answer two questions:\nWhat do you predict Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2019 personal challenge will be?\nWhat do you think Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2019 personal challenge should be?\nHere\u2019s what they said \u2026\nWill be: Spend time with people he wants to connect with, perhaps employees or maybe his family.\nShould be: Hire more people of color at the executive level, reporting directly to him. Bring more people of color, especially women of color, on to the Facebook board \u2026 Learn about the history of harassment on the internet over the past decade and a half from people targeted, from Pizzagate to Gamergate \u2013 and pay them for their time. Meet with the people in Myanmar and in India who have been victims of harassment from Facebook and WhatsApp.\nWill be: Continue to evade parliamentary scrutiny and personal responsibility for Facebook\u2019s problems.\nShould be: Have a productive life having resigned from the company he founded to leave a new leadership team to clean up his mess.\nWill be: Some trivial act of personal development that gives him an aura of moral growth without actually reforming the troubled mind and soul of his that helped put a demagogue in charge of America.\nShould be: Resigning from Facebook \u2013 and bringing Sheryl Sandberg with him, so she can spend all her time convincing women that patriarchy is really just a posture problem. Then he should reorient his charitable foundation. It should stop trying to end all disease and refocus on healing the plague that Facebook has become. It should stop trying to transform education and refocus on educating billionaire techies with huge power but limited moral imaginations.\nWill be: A further commitment this year to improving the platform.\nShould be: Mark would have an easier time tackling Facebook\u2019s problems if he could better understand them on a human level \u2013 not as data points. Just as he set off two years ago to visit all 50 states, he should set out to visit 50 people who were personally affected by all the bullying, hate speech, ethnic cleansing and live-streamed suicides that have occurred on his platform.\nWill be: Being more willing to admit error.\nShould be: Building social media tools that will strengthen democracy.\nWill be: Trying to learn yet another language in 2019. If he\u2019s self-aware in any way he will choose to master Burmese so he can better understand the genocide his platforms amplify.\nShould be: Understanding his own company. I could send him a substantial reading list of scholarship that assesses the influence of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp in the world. Zuckerberg could take a three-month sabbatical to digest all that work. Better than that, Zuckerberg could take a two-year sabbatical from Facebook, enroll at the University of Virginia, and finish his bachelor\u2019s degree under my direction. That would serve him \u2013 and his company and all its users \u2013 better than just about anything else he could do.\nWill be: To finally leave Facebook: \u201cIt\u2019s just not fun here any more, at first Facebook was about hanging out with my friends and sharing cool stuff. But now, most of my friends have quit and the ones that haven\u2019t are, no offense, just the most narcissistic crazy ones addicted to the fake positive reinforcement they get. I think about all the people in my life who I actually respect and I\u2019m like \u2018I never see those people at Facebook any more.\u201d\nShould be: Spend the entire next year as one of those poor outsourced contractors who has to sit there for 10 hours a day looking at all the violent and pedophilic images people report. He should feel the trauma of being on the ground level of his giant editor-less libertarian media dystopia.\nWill be: Something vague that won\u2019t require any real accountability, like \u201cdo better\u201d.\nShould be: Speaking for myself? Find a new job.\nShould be: Take local contexts into account when shaping global policies to regulate content. This will require a more meaningful engagement with civil society around the world: understanding their issues and listening to their concerns is the only way to make Facebook a safer and better place. Zuckerberg should listen to an activist every day.\nWill be: Working out how artificial intelligence can safeguard democracy.\nShould be: Breaking up Facebook into at least three smaller companies, while he steps away from the computer and focuses on learning something more low risk for the rest of humanity, like falconry maybe, or macram\u00e9.\nWill be: Work more closely with news organizations and public policy orgs to better understand the reach, scope and impact of Facebook\u2019s machinations.\nShould be: Resign and find a pursuit that will teach him humility and help him find his moral compass.\nWill be: Something humble, modest, and quantifiable \u2013 like maybe \u201cspend a day in the shoes of a frontline employee in every major team at Facebook\u201d.\nShould be: Commit to building better tools to empower users. There is no top-down fix Facebook could provide that would make all 2.2 billion-ish of us happy, so it\u2019s time to put more meaningful choices \u2013 especially about content and privacy \u2013 in our hands.\nShould be: Aggressively addressing the systemic problems in his company \u2026 He desperately needs to begin implementing systemic solutions, in a way that is transparent, rebuilds the public trust and provides a safer platform for all people.\nWill be: Pretending he has even a passing interest in how other people might feel.\nShould be: Working in retail. Waiting tables at the Olive Garden \u2013 a place with rules about flare and scripted upselling.\nWill be: Some other, similarly broad, challenge that relates to making Facebook a force for good in the world.\nShould be: Take personal responsibility for turning Facebook around as a company. That means publicly committing to creating an ethical and principled company that respects civil society, and ensuring that at every level Facebook makes decisions based on human rights instead of market forces. It means personally committing to a Facebook that doesn\u2019t accidentally make decisions that aid violent regimes, white supremacists and other bad actors. Above all, it means simply being honest about Facebook\u2019s largely detrimental role in global society. That would be the biggest challenge of all.\nResponses have been edited for clarity and brevity.",

        "content": "The press briefing has become a monthly event in the era of Trump, and concerns are that it may soon disappear altogether \nLaptops and phones, winter coats and scarves, a hubbub of different languages. A row of cameras sits on a bench. John Roberts of Fox News has a steely expression as he clutches a mic. Jim Acosta of CNN, press pass reinstated after his run-in with the president last year, speaks simultaneously to his own viewers: \u201cWe\u2019ll see how much time we have Sarah Sanders. As we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, these briefings can end very quickly.\u201d\nThen a voice on the public-address system: \u201cThe press briefing will begin at 1.20pm. Thank you.\u201d The hundred-or-so journalists crammed into the seats and aisles erupt in knowing laughs and groans. Sanders eventually enters at 1.35pm. It will be the White House press secretary\u2019s sole briefing in the whole of November \u2013 a paltry total she will match in December.\nThe question-and-answer session was described as must-see television in the early months of the Trump administration, gripping millions of viewers and earning the accolade of parody on the TV variety show Saturday Night Live. But now the daily press briefing is no more. It has effectively become a monthly press briefing, raising concerns that it might soon disappear altogether.\n\u201cThat would be a tragedy and a campaign point in 2020,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, who served as White House communications director for 11 days in 2017. \u201cI pray that that does not happen. For the president to be successful, you don\u2019t want that to be a campaign talking point in 2020. The American people intuitively know that there needs to be an open communication between the White House and the free press.\u201d\nThe first official White House press secretary was George Akerson under President Herbert Hoover in 1929. In recent decades the position became best known to the outside world for the briefing, in which the press secretary stands at a podium and fields questions from reporters in a briefing room (formerly a swimming pool) in the west wing.\nFew have made such an explosive start as Sean Spicer, whose debut briefing in January 2017 included a tirade at the media and the now-infamous assertion about Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period \u2013 both in person and around the globe.\u201d\nSpicer\u2019s briefings became a compulsive, car-crash spectacle. There was fluster, ill-fitting suits, gaffes such as \u201cHolocaust centres\u201d and Melissa McCarthy\u2019s deathless impression of him with motorised lectern on Saturday Night Live. Scaramucci said: \u201cThey were must-watch television because he made a decision that he was going to lie and so everyone knew he was lying. There was a contradiction to the press briefing. Every Spice Girl has a nickname. His was Liar Spice.\u201d\nWhen Spicer was replaced by Sarah Sanders, the ship steadied, even though the falsehoods and acrimonious exchanges did not. Briefings became scarcer and lost the old momentum. It was like a long-running TV series that had passed its prime but did not know when to quit.\nSanders gave 11 briefings in January, seven in February, eight in March, eight in April, eight in May, five in June, three in July, five in August, one in September, two in October and one in November, making a total of 59, according to a count by Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. Each of the last three was alongside other officials, not on her own.\nOver the comparable period in 2010, Barack Obama\u2019s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, held 95 briefings, Kumar\u2019s research found. And from January to November 2002, George W Bush\u2019s press secretary, Ari Fleischer, held a total of 85 briefings.\nSanders is not only more infrequent but also terser. Her briefings were usually around 15 to 18 minutes, according to Kumar, whereas Gibbs\u2019s were usually around an hour and Fleischer\u2019s were about 25 minutes.\nThe shift coincides with the press enjoying increasing access to Trump himself. It has become a ritual for the president to stop on the South Lawn and take questions from a scrum of media, albeit competing with the roar of the Marine One helicopter, before he boards and flies away. Combined with his insatiable tweeting, he has effectively rendered the press secretary close to redundant.\nKumar writes: \u201cThe basic finding is that Sarah Sanders doesn\u2019t give briefings when Trump is doing multiple interviews and Q&As. October is a clear, though somewhat extreme, example. Together, Trump gave 71 interviews and short Q&As and she gave two briefings. In January, on the other hand, she gave 11 briefings and he did a total of 15 interviews and Q&As.\u201d\nThe White House Correspondents Association has raised the issue with the administration. Olivier Knox, its president and author of a 2013 article headlined \u201cSave the (terrible) White House briefing\u201d, said: \u201cIt\u2019s largely happened with the president of the United States being significantly more available in terms of taking questions from reporters on the South Lawn and in a series of interviews. He\u2019s become much more his own spokesman.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any White House reporter who thinks the president should take fewer questions. It\u2019s a little bit messy but that\u2019s to be expected. I don\u2019t know if they know they can ask the marines to turn off the helicopter.\u201d\nBut the decline of briefings by the press secretary is concerning, Knox argues. \u201cThe people who are hurt the most are the smaller news outlets. If you\u2019re down to one, two or three people in your Washington bureau, having a set time when the White House is available for questions is important.\u201d\nScaramucci, who during his brief tenure insisted that live TV coverage of the briefings should resume, said: \u201cAny time that the press can talk to the principal and can talk to the principal in volume, which has been experienced in this White House, is in general a very good thing for free press. I would, however, caution that it is still necessary for the comms team to have a regular interaction with the press because there are many things that go on inside the White House and the administration that the comms team and the press secretary need to discuss that is perhaps different from the principal.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not a great excuse to use the accessibility of the principal as an alibi for having less press conferences.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s freewheeling question-and-answer sessions, interviews and tweets, along with a steady flow of White House leaks, have arguably made this the most transparent presidency in American history. Yet in other ways this administration, with its flouting of norms and lurches from crisis to crisis, is also the most opaque.\nMike McCurry, who was press secretary to President Bill Clinton in the pre-Twitter 1990s, said: \u201cIf you have a president who gives you his innermost thoughts by tweets, why do you need a spokesperson to amplify what the president has already told you? But there\u2019s an accountability function where the press has an opportunity to ask about federal government and all the other things going on.\n\u201cIt was religious that we would do some kind of briefing every day. It was sacrosanct that someone would stand up at the White House every day and answer questions as an essential part of American democracy. The idea you could go a month without a briefing is astonishing.\u201d",

To get ahead on summer 2019 fashion, the footwear to buy into is the humble flip-flop. The thonged sandal \u2013 which dates back to at least 4000BC \u2013 is, of course, a regular sight from beach to city street every summer. But it hasn\u2019t been properly fashionable, arguably, since the early 00s, when women like Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen made it as integral to their LA around-town look as XXXL sunglasses and four-figure handbags worn hooked over one arm.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nWith this era rediscovered by a generation of people who were children around the turn of the millennium, it makes sense that flip-flops are in focus again. They were a trend among influencers at Copenhagen fashion week this year \u2013 increasingly a site for emerging street style.\nDesigners from Michael Kors to Molly Goddard featured versions of flip-flops on the catwalk for spring. The Olsen sisters, meanwhile, have consistently worn them. When a photograph of the duo for WSJ magazine was shared on Instagram in August to announce the addition of menswear to their fashion line The Row, it was the black flip-flops they were wearing that caused a frenzy. The post has so far received more than 10,000 likes.\nPart of the appeal of the flip-flop is, of course, the price. The biggest brand in the world of flip-flops is Havaianas, which was founded in Brazil in 1962. With countless variations available, the Tradicional style is \u00a316.\nRetailers including Net-a-Porter and Asos are tipping the flip-flop as the style for summer 2019. \u201cFlip-flops are a big deal for Asos for spring,\u201d says Aisling McKeefry, Asos head of design. \u201cOriginally evolving from Instagram, the trend is for simple toe thong designs on to flats and super-sexy glam heels. Toe loops are also going to be trending.\u201d\nElizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at Net-a-Porter, agrees, saying: \u201cFor spring/summer 19, Staud are doing this trend particularly well with their chic asymmetric styles in a variety of textured and leather colourways. Chlo\u00e9 too have amazing wrap versions. We\u2019re excited to have bought heavily into these collections for next season.\u201d\nThe stylist Jeanette Friis Madsen, a street-style favourite who was photographed in flip-flops at Copenhagen fashion week, believes their relatability means they are a sure thing for the summer. \u201cThey\u2019re easy, affordable, comfortable, casual and fun,\u201d she says. Rather than saving flip-flops for the beach, she advises using them as a way to bring a casual edge to daytime outfits. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect to downgrade a flashy summery dress,\u201d she says. \u201cOr mix them up with a pair of wide suit trousers for an effortless expression.\u201d",

        "content": "At the vegetarian wholesaler Suma, every employee is paid at the same hourly rate\nWhen the government forced all UK businesses over a certain size to publish their gender pay gap figures last year, many red-faced chief executives struggled to justify why the men they employed were earning so much more than the women.\nNot so at the ethical wholesaler Suma, which says it is the largest equal-pay co-operative in Europe. First, because it doesn\u2019t have a CEO. And second, because all of Suma\u2019s 190 employees, or \u201cmembers\u201d , earn exactly the same: \u00a315.60 an hour, equating to \u00a333,000 for a 35-hour, five-day week, plus bonuses and shares. From the 26-year-old newbie to the 65-year-old who has been with Suma since its birth as a co-op in 1977, there are no exceptions.\nIn Suma\u2019s home of Elland, a market town near Halifax in West Yorkshire, that salary can buy you a home (a three-bed apartment in a converted mill is currently on sale for \u00a3103,000), plus \u201ca decent car, a good family life and a nice holiday\u201d, according to Nathalie Spencer, 35, who has worked at Suma for 14 years.\nHer main job is in international sales \u2013 the business turned over \u00a355m last year and exports 7,000 vegetarian products to 40 different countries \u2013 but like all Suma members, she multitasks, and can sometimes be seen driving a reach truck in the warehouse or loading up lorries.\n\u201cIt sounds a bit random, but l like the team spirit involved in loading lorries, that sense of achievement at the end of each day, rather than leaving scattered notes on your desk and forgetting half of them,\u201d she says.\n \nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on \nconfrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis\n series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope,\n as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that \nmight and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we \nshould report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nWhen the Guardian visits, Paul Collins, the account manager for one of Suma\u2019s national chain customers and the brand coordinator for Suma\u2019s Ecoleaf household range, is serving up vegetarian pizza in the free staff canteen.\nJenny Carlyle, 33, who is in charge of hiring (and, only very occasionally, firing) in the personnel department, likes to go off and spend an afternoon in the deep freezer when she needs to clear her head.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice to put on the freezer suit and pick products at -20C,\u201d she says, and anyway, it makes her better at her main job if she understands all aspects of the business. \u201cWorking in the freezer or warehouse might be looked down on at normal companies, but actually it is such an integral part of our business as a wholesaler that we all need to understand it, and so it makes sense that our warehouse workers are paid the same as everyone else.\u201d\nWhen she first heard of Suma, she assumed there must be a catch, but she soon realised the benefits of equal pay. \u201cBeing all paid the same is liberating,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I was probably overpaid when I started and now, 11 years on, with all my experience and all the courses I have done, I am probably being underpaid. But it evens out. Overall I have probably been paid more than if I had climbed the ladder at a normal business.\n\u201cIt takes some of that career pressure off as well. One of the great things I love about Suma is that we all have times in our life when we can\u2019t put 100% into our working life, and at Suma you can step back for a little bit when you need to and then step back up when you can and there is no penalty for that.\u201d\nThough the co-op is understanding if members need to take time out \u2013 whether to have a baby, move house, care for a relative or, like Carlyle, get a master\u2019s degree \u2013 they are all expected to engage in big strategic issues of the business. New hires are warned: \u201cYou\u2019re not just a worker, you\u2019re an owner \u2026 you can\u2019t just coast along, you need to take responsibility, taking part in the democracy and putting yourself forward to make things happen.\u201d\nBetween 120 and 550 people apply each time Suma has a recruitment round, in which the co-op generally hires up to 12 members. Applicants are wildly varied, says Carlyle: \u201cIn one round we might have someone with 40 years\u2019 experience in logistics and then someone in their early 20s straight out of university.\u201d\nRegardless of experience, newcomers are put on probation and spend their first three months working in the warehouse or driving \u2013 proving their ability to work safely, quickly and accurately in the less glamorous side of Suma\u2019s operation. For a further six months, they work in a variety of departments and complete various targets. Only then, after an exhausting round of feedback, is there a vote from everyone at Suma to decide if they should be allowed to join as a member.\nMore than 90% make it through the process, says Carlyle, who at 23 found herself on Suma\u2019s management committee, its version of a board. \u201cThat was an experience most 23-year-olds would never be able to have. It\u2019s that mixture of freedom and opportunity as well as the flexibility to step back when you need to without losing your place that\u2019s really wonderful, and that\u2019s all enabled by equal pay,\u201d she says.\nIsis Carrasco, 47, a former charity manager, took a pay cut when she moved to Suma to become a project manager three years ago. \u201cEqual pay is equal opportunities in terms of opening horizons and being able to do jobs that you would not be able to do unless you change your career,\u201d says the cheerful Spaniard. \u201cFor example, I like DIY a lot and now I have the opportunity not just to project manage but also put shelves up. I am getting the opportunity to develop these sort of skills at work, skills you\u2019d normally have to change career to learn.\u201d\nIt can take a little time to adjust to co-op life, says Carlyle. \u201cIt can be stressful at first figuring out how it works where there\u2019s no clear hierarchy for decision-making. At a normal company you might only need to have one conversation to get something done. Here you will have to have five or six, and sometimes the whole co-op votes. Sometime people come here thinking it is a real utopia, but people are flawed and they do make mistakes.\u201d\nOne of Suma\u2019s six founders, Jim Crabtree, still works a few days a week at the co-op. Carlyle says she sat next to him in the canteen once and asked whether he ever regretted the decision to turn the business into a member-owned co-operative. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u00a350m business now, so he would have a one-sixth share in that rather than a one in 190 share. He stopped eating and said: \u2018Never.\u2019 I feel really grateful to those six people who decided to share the company back when I wasn\u2019t even born. It was a really generous thing they did and I am very, very proud to carry on their work.\u201d\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com\n This article was amended on 7 January 2019, to make it clear that Suma says it is the largest equal pay cooperative in Europe, and not one of the largest cooperatives in Europe.",

        "content": "With Democrats now in the majority in the House, five committee chairs will wield considerable power to investigate the president\nThe midterm elections brought an end to a period of one-party rule in Washington. In January, Donald Trump will face a newly empowered House Democratic majority eager to take him on.\nThe incoming Democratic committee chairs have vowed rigorous oversight of Trump and his administration. Armed with committee gavels, they will now have the power and resources to pursue investigations, issue subpoenas and compel testimony.\nTrump in response has threatened to adopt a \u201cwarlike\u201d posture, signaling a tumultuous end to an already-volatile first term.\nHere are the men and women most likely to torment the president.\nIncoming chair of the House committee on oversight and government reform\nAs the ranking Democrat on the committee, Cummings has sat through his share of Republican-led investigations into the Obama administration. Now the outspoken 67-year-old will wield one of the most powerful gavels in Washington.\nThe son of two former sharecroppers who moved from the south, Cummings was born and raised in Baltimore, a city he now represents in Congress. He practiced law and served for 14 years in the Maryland house of delegates before being elected to Congress in 1996.\nIn January, Cummings will become one of the Democrats\u2019 chief investigators into the Trump administration.\nHe describes his approach as having \u201ctwo tracks\u201d. One track will scrutinize the executive branch, including whether Trump has profited from the presidency; a decision to add a citizenship question to the US census; and hush payments made to women with whom Trump allegedly had affairs. A second track will focus on reforms such as overhauling the US postal service and lowering prescription drug prices.\nCummings has been wary of calls to impeach Trump. Rather than issuing subpoenas \u201clike somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween\u201d, the Democrat says he prefers a more judicious approach.\n  \u201cI\u2019m not looking for retribution,\u201d Cummings told ABC News. \u201cLife is too short.\u201d\nIncoming chair of the House permanent select committee on intelligence\nSchiff is one of Trump\u2019s most combative political opponents.\nMocked by the president as \u201cLiddle Adam Schiff\u201d \u2013 a barb that was recently modified to \u201cLittle Adam Schitt\u201d \u2013 the California Democrat was at the center of the House\u2019s deeply partisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nSchiff began his career as a prosecutor with the Los Angeles division of the US attorney\u2019s office in 1987. He gained prominence by prosecuting a case against the first FBI agent to be indicted for espionage against the United States. (The agent was convicted of passing classified information to the Soviet Union for money.) He was elected to Congress in 2000 after serving in the California state senate.\nSchiff, 58, is a leading attack dog on the Russia investigation and obstruction of justice.\nThe Democrat has said he will examine whether Russia has financial leverage over the president through its investments in Trump\u2019s business empire, something Trump says would \u201ccross a red line\u201d.\nSchiff recently said: \u201cIf the president\u2019s business is trying to curry favor with the Kremlin, we can\u2019t ignore that.\u201d\nThe congressman has also signaled that he will seek more information about whether Trump sought to obstruct the FBI\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s dealings with Moscow when he fired its director James Comey. He also hasn\u2019t ruled out calling Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr, to testify in a public hearing.\nIncoming chair of the House judiciary committee\nThe New York Democrat, universally known as \u201cJerry\u201d, will chair the House judiciary committee, which has jurisdiction over key policy areas but will be watched closely for its role in any impeachment proceedings.\nNadler\u2019s political career began in 1977 as a New York assemblyman while he was still attending Fordham Law School. He was elected to Congress in 1992, and represents Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, Wall Street and parts of Brooklyn.\nLong before Trump came to Washington, he and Nadler sparred over a real estate venture proposed by Trump that Nadler forcefully opposed. In his book The America We Deserve, Trump later described Nadler as \u201cone of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics\u201d.\nKnown as a steady hand, Nadler had been careful about broaching the topic of impeachment, dismissing such discussions as \u201cpremature\u201d. However, in December Nadler said court filings stating that Trump directed Cohen to pay hush money \u201cwould be impeachable offenses\u201d.\nNadler, 71, has outlined an expansive list of subjects his committee will scrutinize, including Russian interference in the 2016 election; the policy on separating immigrant families at the southern border; the justice department\u2019s failure to defend the Affordable Care Act; the allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury by the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh; a rise in antisemitic and hate crime incidents since Trump\u2019s election, and the appointment of acting US attorney general Matthew Whitaker after the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions.\nIncoming chair of the House financial services committee\nWaters, or \u201cAuntie Maxine\u201d as she is affectionately known by her supporters in the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d movement, is a frequent target of the president.\nInsulted by Trump as \u201ccrazy\u201d and an \u201cextraordinarily low IQ person\u201d, the 80-year-old Democrat from California has earned her hard-charging reputation by fighting fire with fire. She has called Trump an \u201cimmoral, indecent, & inhumane thug\u201d who \u201cloves Putin\u201d and \u201cgenuflects for Kim Jong-un\u201d.\nThe verbal volleys may only get worse as she assumes the top spot on the House financial services committee next year.\nWaters has consistently demanded information about Trump\u2019s private bank dealings and possible connections to Russia. As chairwoman, she will have the power to demand answers from Trump\u2019s biggest lender, Deutsche Bank.\nShe could also increase scrutiny on the nation\u2019s biggest banks and Wall Street. Waters has called for more regulation of banks and could use her power to slow efforts by the Trump administration to roll back regulations on the financial institutions.\nWaters was one of the first Democrats in Washington to call for the president\u2019s impeachment.\nShe will be the first woman to chair the financial services committee.\nIncoming chair of the House ways and means committee\nAs chairman of the powerful tax-writing committee, the long-serving Massachusetts Democrat is preparing to lead the fight for the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns.\nNeal told the Washington Post that he will start by requesting Trump voluntarily release his tax returns.\nIn the likely event Trump does not acquiesce, Neal, 69, says he will file a legal request with the treasury department to release the returns to a select group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Neal expects the effort will ultimately end up in federal court.\nNeal will also use his perch to defend social security, Medicare and Medicaid, federal programs that have personal resonance with him. His parents died when he was young, and Neal and his sisters relied on social security survivor benefit checks.\nHe was elected to Congress in 1988 after serving as a city councilor and mayor of Springfield. He became the ranking Democrat on the committee in 2016.\nAn outspoken opponent of the Republican tax overhaul, Neal has said he also plans to convene hearings on tax policy as well as healthcare and trade.",

        "content": "Whistleblower says he quit Newcross Healthcare in disgust at its intense sales focus\nManagers at one of the UK\u2019s biggest providers of agency health workers are pressured into imposing \u00a350 fines on employees who phone in sick as part of a \u201cvicious\u201d and \u201ccut-throat\u201d sales-driven culture, a whistleblower has claimed.\nA Guardian investigation revealed how Newcross Healthcare, which made \u00a321m in pre-tax profits in 2017, not only failed to give sick pay to carers or nurses but also issued punitive fines when unwell workers cancelled shifts without 24 hours\u2019 notice.\nNow a whistleblower who worked as a business centre manager for the firm has described an intense sales environment at the company, which employs 7,000 staff providing temporary nurses and care workers for hospitals and residential care homes.\nThe whistleblower, who quit the firm in 2018, alleges:\nRegional managers pressured branches to impose fines on sick employees, even if they knew absences were genuine.\nCare homes were forced to send home sick agency staff who had turned up because they were afraid of being docked wages.\nManagers were put up in a five-star hotel in Gibraltar each year for a \u201clavish\u201d sales bash where awards would be given out.\nManagers were tasked with repeatedly cold-calling care and nursing homes to book in shifts for agency workers, with a target of achieving 3,000 hours of shifts a week.\nThe industry watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), has said it has contacted Newcross and is considering taking action. It said: \u201cIt is essential that providers take all necessary steps to ensure that people receiving care are not put at risk.\u201d\nThe whistleblower, who did not wish to be named, was one of around 60 business centre managers at branches around the country tasked with filling thousands of hours of shifts a week for agency nurses and carers supplied to local homes and hospitals.\nHe described the firm as vicious and cut-throat and said he quit after becoming disgusted with the culture, which he said was misrepresented when he took up the job.\n\u201cWe were targeted each week as to how many hours we would fill with our staff. I was up to about 3,000 or so hours a week to fill across all my staff,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI got on well with my staff and my team but the regional manager \u2026 the pressure was quite ferocious. They get heavily targeted to make sure they\u2019re filling their quota. I found myself getting to the stage that when someone was calling up saying \u2018I can\u2019t do that shift you\u2019ve put me down for next week\u2019, feeling really agitated, thinking: I\u2019m going to have to fill this shift otherwise I\u2019m going to get it in the neck.\u201d\nHe estimated he handed out about 10 \u00a350 fines a month to workers who cancelled shifts. If this number was replicated across the firm\u2019s various branches, it would mean workers were being fined hundreds of times a month.\nThe whistleblower said: \u201cEven if it was someone I had a good working relationship with and knew that their absence was a genuine one, we would still look to hit them with the \u00a350. If we didn\u2019t I would be questioned as to why I didn\u2019t do it and I would have to have a good reason why I didn\u2019t do it. So I felt under pressure to enforce that.\u201d\nOn some occasions care home managers would send Newcross workers home after they had turned up sick because they did not want to be docked wages. The source said: \u201cI would sometimes have the managers phoning up saying, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve sent them home but they\u2019re still to get paid because they were here, they\u2019re worried they\u2019re going to lose money from it.\u2019\u201d\nRegional managers put pressure on branch managers to fill shifts and impose fines to ensure they were not missed, the source said.\n\u201cI\u2019d been there for a few weeks and it became quite apparent to me that I was there to manage the healthcare workers who were going out to sites, enforcing the reduction of salary for missing of appointments regardless of the scenario,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor me, if people were phoning up and saying they were unwell, that\u2019s not a planned absence. If they\u2019re unwell, they\u2019re unwell. However, there was no capacity for me to be able to waiver that, or if I did waiver it, as the manager, I had to give a full explanation to why I was going to waive it.\u201d\nBranch managers who succeeded in cajoling their staff to fill shifts were rewarded handsomely with a lavish annual April bash in the tax haven of Gibraltar, where Newcross\u2019s owners are based.\nHe said: \u201cThe business centre managers would be taken off to Gibraltar for the annual get-together where it was very lavish, everything was paid for. It would be a great slap-on-the-back chance for everyone to say look at our figures. Awards would be given out for the people who had taken the most amount of hours.\n\u201cEveryone was taken to Gibraltar, there was a five-star hotel. Everyone was put up there for a few nights and went to the casino. Whereas the carers don\u2019t get to participate in anything like that. They say they\u2019re employees of Newcross but they\u2019re just treated like agency staff.\u201d\nNewcross has said it will scrap the \u00a350 charge in April but it has faced calls from the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, to end it immediately.\nDebbie Westhead, the CQC\u2019s interim chief inspector of adult social care, said: \u201cCQC will always listen and act when concerns about poor care are raised with us. We have contacted Newcross about this matter and are considering if there are any further steps we need to take. It is essential that providers take all necessary steps to ensure that people receiving care are not put at risk.\u201d\nNewcross did not respond to repeated requests for comment.",

        "content": "Shortlisted contenders for the Royal Academy of Engineering Africa prize reveal their designs, from gloves that translate sign language into speech to smart lockers that dispense medicines\nThe Royal Academy of Engineering Africa prize, now in its fifth year, has shortlisted 16 African inventors from six countries to receive funding, training and mentoring for projects intended to revolutionise sectors from agriculture and science to women\u2019s health. The winner will be awarded \u00a325,000 and the three runners up will receive \u00a310,000 each.\nFrom smart gloves that turn sign language into audio speech, to water harvesting systems that change air into drinking water, five inventors on course to transform the continent for the better spoke to the Guardian about their innovations.\nRoy Allela\u2019s six-year-old niece was born deaf. She found it difficult to communicate with her family, none of whom knew sign language. So Allela \u2013 a 25-year-old Kenyan technology evangelist who works for Intel and tutors data science at Oxford University \u2013 invented smart gloves that convert sign language movements into audio speech.\nThe gloves \u2013 named Sign-IO \u2013 have flex sensors stitched on to each finger. The sensors quantify the bend of the fingers and process the letter being signed. The gloves are paired via Bluetooth to a mobile phone application that Allela also developed, which then vocalises the letters.\n\u201cMy niece wears the gloves, pairs them to her phone or mine, then starts signing and I\u2019m able to understand what she\u2019s saying,\u201d says Allela. \u201cLike all sign language users, she\u2019s very good at lip reading, so she doesn\u2019t need me to sign back.\u201d\nAllela piloted the gloves at a special needs school in rural Migori county, south-west Kenya, where feedback helped inform one of the most important aspects of the gloves: the speed at which the language is converted into audio.\n\u201cPeople speak at different speeds and it\u2019s the same with people who sign: some are really fast, others are slow, so we integrated that into the mobile application so that it\u2019s comfortable for anyone to use it.\u201d\nUsers can also set the language, gender and pitch of the vocalisation through the app, with accuracy results averaging 93%, says Allela. Perhaps most importantly, the gloves can be packaged in any style the user wants, whether that\u2019s a princess glove or a Spider-Man one, he says. \u201cIt fights the stigma associated with being deaf and having a speech impediment. If the gloves look cool, every kid will want to know why you have them on.\u201d\nThe gloves recently won the hardware trailblazer award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Allela is using the prize money to land more accurate vocal predictions.\nHis goal is to place at least two pairs of gloves in every special needs school in Kenya, and believes they could be used to help the 34 million children worldwide who suffer disabling hearing loss.\n\u201cI was trying to envision how my niece\u2019s life would be if she had the same opportunities as everyone else in education, employment, all aspects of life,\u201d says Allela.\n\u201cThe general public in Kenya doesn\u2019t understand sign language so when she goes out, she always needs a translator. Picture over the long term that dependency, how much that plagues or impairs her progress in life \u2026 when it affects you personally, you see how hard people have it in life. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve really strived to develop this project to completion.\u201d\nWhen Neo Hutiri was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2014, the South African engineer was forced to spend three hours every two weeks waiting at his local clinic just to collect his medication. Queuing alongside patients requiring chronic therapy for health issues ranging from cancer to Aids, Hutiri wondered how he could apply technology to the problem and ease the burden for South Africa\u2019s overrun public hospitals.\n\u201cWe have the biggest antiretroviral [ARV] therapy programme in the world: over 4.6m patients receive ARVs and with chronic therapy treatments like this you have to visit the facility every month to receive medication,\u201d says Hutiri.\n\u201cIt dawned on me that patients are spending a lot of time \u2013 4.3m man hours in total every month \u2013 just waiting in queues. So my initial hypothesis was to take patients\u2019 waiting time from three hours to under two minutes.\u201d\nHutiri\u2019s first move was to automate the filing system as much as possible by designing the Pelebox (pele for fast in Setswana), a smart locker that acts as a self-service kiosk. The locker is stocked by health workers, who scan a patient\u2019s medication into a specialised cubicle. The number of the locker and a one-time pin are sent directly to the patient\u2019s mobile phone, with the pin allowing the user to open the locker.\nSouth Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical council was intrigued by the Pelebox, but needed reassurance that the right medications would be delivered to the right patients, every single time. Hutiri piloted the project in Pretoria last year and was overjoyed at the results: 4,700 medications were delivered at a 100% success rate \u2013 and with an average collection time of under 36 seconds, says Hutiri.\nThe 30-year-old entrepreneur has now signed a contract with the department of health to roll the lockers out in eight of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces, a feat he is hugely proud of.\n\u201cEighty-three percent of the South African population relies on state-funded care \u2013 my parents are within that population and on long-term medication \u2013 but they get short-handed because there isn\u2019t enough of an incentive for entrepreneurs in my sector to serve them as they tend to be low-income,\u201d says Hutiri.\n\u201cI wanted to design something that you could place as easily in [the affluent area of] Sandton as in a township. I wanted the product to stand out because then the patients feel a high degree of pride, they think: \u2018This product was designed for me\u2019. When you treat people with respect, they pass that respect on to others.\u201d\nMore than two-thirds of Uganda\u2019s population engages in farming, but rapid population growth in the capital, Kampala, means that not everyone who would like to grow their own fruit and veg has the space or land to do so.\nThis was the issue faced by Paul Matovu, who was born into a family of 20 children and raised for a short time by his grandparents in rural Uganda, where he learned all about growing crops. After returning to Kampala as a cash-strapped university student, he began looking for space-saving ways to grow his own food. His solution was the \u201cfarm in a box\u201d, a sustainably sourced timber box measuring 90cm wide by 90cm high that can hold up to 200 plants.\nThe farms currently retail at 300,000 shillings (\u00a364), a high price for the average Ugandan, says Matovu, but as the boxes produce food worth 1.29m shillings (\u00a3275) every year, costs can be quickly recouped. The farms also have a wormery in their middle to compost household waste, the castings of which can then be used to fertilise the crops, helping to keep inputs low but still organic, he says.\n\u201cOur goal is to roll out the farms to the wealthy, because they do not mind how expensive the boxes are, and to produce three to five farms per day,\u201d says Matovu. \u201cThen we can subsidise sales to the poor.\u201d\nIn 2015, Kenyan Collince Oluoch was working as a community health worker in Nairobi, knocking door-to-door to register children for a national immunisation drive. The work was tedious and difficult: every volunteer was required to register 200 children, but because some families were at work or out shopping or had simply moved away, the targets couldn\u2019t always be met.\nOluoch, 27, was faced with a choice: to invent names of children to meet the target (as many other health workers were doing), or to modify the existing pen-and-paper registration system into a digital database. He opted for the latter, and in 2016 built Chanjo Plus, an online vaccination platform that could be accessed by health clinics and hospitals across the country.\n\u201cThe initial plan was to have an accountable platform to put the faces behind the numbers,\u201d says Oluoch. \u201cWe have universal health coverage in Kenya and the aim is that by 2030 we will leave no one behind. But how do you leave no one behind if you don\u2019t even know who everyone is?\u201d\nThe database uses information compiled by community health workers to build a digital identity for each child, with details on which vaccinations were given and when and where they were given. These records can then be pulled up by any public health clinic anywhere, making it easy to identify which children are falling through the immunisation gaps and provide real-time data on vaccination drives.\nChanjo Plus has so far enrolled 10,000 children at three clinics in Nairobi, and aims to scale up with the ministry of health to target the 1.5 million children born in Kenya every year, says Oluoch. He then hopes it can be a platform used across sub-Saharan Africa, where one in five children still don\u2019t have access to life-saving vaccines.\n\u201cPeople are still dying because of measles, polio, diarrhoea, and pneumonia \u2013 diseases that can be prevented and should not be causing deaths now. Getting every child access to vaccines translates into healthy lives for families: it means poverty reduction and greater access to education.\u201d\nWhen Beth Koigi moved into her university dormitory in eastern Kenya, she was horrified that the water coming out of the tap was filthy and laden with bacteria. Within months, she had built her first filter and was soon selling filters to others. When drought hit in 2016 and water restrictions saw Koigi\u2019s water supply turned off entirely, she began thinking about water scarcity and its relation to climate change.\n\u201cGoing for months without any tap water became a very bad situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere I used to live, we didn\u2019t get any tap water at all, so even doing simple things like going to the toilet \u2013 I would go to the mall instead. Having no water at all is worse than just having unpurified water, so I started thinking about a way to not have to rely on the council.\u201d\nWhile on a four-month programme at the Silicon Valley-based thinktank Singularity University, Koigi, 27, joined up with two other women \u2013 American environmental scientist Anastasia Kaschenko and British economist Clare Sewell \u2013 to create Majik Water, which captures water from the air and converts it into drinking water using solar technology.\nThe device \u2013 which won first prize this year at the EDF Africa awards \u2013 could provide a solution for the 1.8 billion people predicted to have a shortage of water by 2025, according to the UN, says Kaschenko.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an interesting relationship between climate change and the water in the atmosphere,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s six times more water in the air than in all the rivers in the world. With every 1F increase in temperature, water begins to evaporate on the ground but increases by about 4% in the atmosphere, and that\u2019s water that\u2019s not being tapped.\u201d\nMajik Water \u2013 from the Swahili maji for water and \u201ck\u201d for kuna (harvest) \u2013 uses desiccants such as silica gels to draw water from the air. The gels are then heated up with solar power to release the water. The current system can generate up to 10 litres of filtered water per day, with the team looking to scale up to 100-litre systems at a cost of only \u00a30.08 per 10 litres.\nThe solar panels used for the prototype are the most expensive input on the device, says Koigi, who is looking for ways to drive those costs down.",

        "content": "The Isle of Lewis is still coming to terms with a maritime disaster that killed 201 men a century ago\nMargaret Ferguson\u2019s family home on the Isle of Lewis was crowded with portraits. There were more than a hundred, and each was of a man looking out from the canvas. Veterans of the first world war, each man drowned on the same night, on the same boat, a short distance from safety.\nIn heavy seas and a pitch-black night, an overcrowded steam yacht taking them home on leave, the Iolaire, struck a treacherous reef known as the Beasts of Holm in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day 1919. They were barely a mile from Stornoway harbour and 50 yards from the shore, and of the 280 men on board, only 79 survived.\nIt remains the UK\u2019s worst peacetime maritime disaster since the sinking of the Titanic \u2013 and is being marked by an official ceremony on Tuesday. Yet a century on, the Iolaire story is barely known beyond the Western Isles, despite its scale and horror.\nIts memory was suppressed too for generations on Lewis: every family, in a still tightly knit community, was either directly affected or knew someone who had died. Until quite recently, it was rarely, if ever, discussed.\n\u201cIt is very, very deep within us. In fact, when I think about it, I get a tightness in my chest. The tears are just below the surface,\u201d Ferguson said.\nFerguson, a painter and a widely respected family doctor on Lewis for the last 30 years, said she felt compelled to make the portraits, using black and white family photographs and an archived roll of honour from the Stornoway Gazette, published in the 1920s. Her great-great uncle, Alexander Mackenzie, is among them.\nShe stored the pictures in her family\u2019s uninhabited ancestral home on the Point peninsula, which overlooks the seas the Iolaire sailed that night, before being exhibited in Stornoway from 31 December until 2 March, one of a series of commemorative events to mark the centenary of the disaster.\nIn Stornoway harbour, 280 illuminated columns are fixed on to the seabed, sketching the outline of the Iolaire\u2019s hull: 201 of those columns have been lit in blue for those who died while 79 remain white for those who survived. Designed by Malcolm MacLean and Torcuil Crichton, the lighting effect on the artwork, named She\u00f2l an Iolaire, Gaelic for \u201cthe Iolaire sailed\u201d, changes as the tide comes in and recedes.\nThe commemorations, among the last being staged to mark the centenary of the first world war, include a New Year\u2019s Day service overlooking the site, which will be attended by Prince Charles and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister.\nFerguson believes Lewis has begun to come to terms with the tragedy; even so, the portraits were kept temporarily in the family home because no one lives there. They were propped up on furniture, hung from walls, stacked against walls. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking in the family, saying that there are so many ghosts in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father finds it very difficult to go into the room with them.\u201d\nAs she worked on each image, \u201cI kept thinking I was honouring this man and what he went through, and his family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I got a bit upset towards the end. It was a very intense experience, especially when I paint the eyes. It feels as if he\u2019s in the room with you.\u201d\nIan Stephen, a poet and former Stornoway coastguard whose career began in a coastguard station overlooking the Beasts of Holm, believes everyone on Lewis knows the stories.\nThere are accounts of drenched, numb survivors immediately walking home across the moors in the storm, too traumatised to wait for help; of women who rushed to the shore to find their sons\u2019 and brothers\u2019 inert bodies among the rocks or surf, their baggage and presents strewn over the sand; of the stream of coffins being taken by horse and cart to be buried every day throughout the following week.\nHis great-uncle, John Smith, was one of those who died. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t talked about much. We were just aware there was a connection to the Iolaire. It\u2019s only recently that it sunk home that was my grandfather\u2019s brother,\u201d Stephen said.\n\u201cPart of the reason for the silence is the enormity of the tragedy; having lived through that hell [of war], they were so close to the shore.\u201d\nAll the men had spent the war at sea, on minesweepers, battlecruisers and destroyers. Some had already survived sinkings under enemy fire. Many, often volunteers who had joined the naval reserve, had navigated the narrow channel where the Iolaire struck the rocks as fishermen in civilian life.\nBut the disaster had one hero, John Finlay Macleod, a boat builder from Ness who was on board the Iolaire that night. He saved nearly 40 lives by diving into the churning seas with a rope, then used it to pull a thick hawser taut between the yacht and the beach as a lifeline for survivors.\nMalcolm Macdonald, the co-author of an authoritative new study of the disaster, The Darkest Dawn, believes the community-wide trauma was amplified by the heavy wartime losses the Western Isles had already experienced, which in turn contributed to further waves of emigration and economic decline in the 1920s.\nLewis and Harris, the two northern islands of the Western Isles, had a population of 34,600 in 1911. Macdonald estimates about 1,500 of those were killed during the war, and with another 201 lost on the Iolaire, that was an immense cumulative loss of young men and fathers.\nAlthough the official board of inquiry refused to find fault, Macdonald and Stephen believe the Iolaire\u2019s commander and navigating officer made colossal navigational errors, taking the wrong course and failing to correct it in time, in a force 8 gale.\nNow aged 70, Macdonald, whose grandfather was among those who died, recalls it was never discussed when he was a child but he has recently been touring schools to discuss his book. \u201cEveryone seems to want to open up and hear the full story. Young children at the schools I have spoken at all sit silently, listening, but then the questions, questions, questions keep pouring out,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "The Norwegian globetrotter has been around the world \u2013 twice \u2013 and here picks the less-travelled countries that have made an impact on him\nWorld\u2019s ninth least-visited country; 3,600 tourists a year\n Few tourists reach Kiribati, not because the country lacks attractions \u2013 just ways to get there. Kiribati is the only country in the world situated in all four hemispheres. Its 33 atolls and islands in the central Pacific Ocean \u2013 about 4,000km south-west of Hawaii and 4,700km east of Australia \u2013 are spread across the equator and international date line over an area the size of India. Air routes to the capital, South Tarawa, are scarce, but that will change in late 2019 when national airline Air Kiribati expands its network to Fiji and Australia. The Tarawa atoll hosts the national government and Betio, the biggest town with decent restaurants, nightlife and hotels. Top attractions involve water: fishing, canoeing and swimming in the beautiful lagoon, surrounded by small palm tree-covered atolls.\nThe most important birthday to be celebrated is the first, as infant mortality rates have historically been high. I was invited to Randall\u2019s party by his emigrated Welsh grandfather. About 200 guests enjoyed a show by dancers in traditional costumes, speeches and blessings for the birthday boy by a nun. Then the dancefloor opened up, and a local guy invited the nun to dance \u2013 they owned the dancefloor. Four huge tables were covered with food, seven pigs were roasted over coal on large barbecues. At the end of the party, hungry villagers were invited to help themselves to leftovers.Stay at Tabon Te Keekee Eco Lodge, where a double, stilted wooden cabin costs from \u00a360\nWorld\u2019s 29th least-visited country;79,000 tourists a year\n Do not confuse this island nation with the much-larger (and more touristy) Dominican Republic, 500 miles north-west. Dominica is a natural wonder that is said to have left Christopher Columbus lost for words when asked to describe the island to Queen Isabella of Spain. When I arrived in 2017, nine months after Hurricane Maria, the country\u2019s worst natural disaster, the clean-up efforts and rebuilding were ongoing. Fallen trees were everywhere and many houses had visible damages, particularly on the eastern side of the island.\nThe only operational airport cannot accommodate bigger aircraft. I flew in on a propeller plane from St Lucia, although it is also possible to visit by ferry from Guadeloupe or Martinique. There is no public transport from the airport, so I picked up a rental car (which had seen better days) and went all over the island. With its gorges, waterfalls, thermal springs and 195 bird species creating a soundtrack, walking through the rainforest was magical. The vibrant capital of Roseau has seen an increase in tourists in the last few years, which in turn has led to a small restaurant boom.\nThe biodiversity has also helped several eco-resorts and lodges across the island flourish, but some hotels remain closed following Hurricane Maria. I rented a flat, and luckily my landlord kept nagging me to visit Emerald Pool and Boiling Lake: the first is like paradise, the second resembles hell, where volcanoes meet the water in sulphurous plumes.Stay at Cocoa Cottages, doubles from \u00a380 (or treehouse from \u00a3156)\nWorld\u2019s 57th least-visited country; 278,000 tourists a year\n The smallest and only Dutch-speaking country in South America, Suriname is the size of England and Wales but 80% of the country is covered with rainforest and the population is only just over half a million. There are white sandy beaches on its Atlantic coast, huge rivers and it has its own Table Mountain (Tafelberg). I went kayaking, hiked on wooded trails and took a dip in a sula (waterfall), but the highlight was being invited by locals to one of the legendary Sunday parties on the river. A speedboat picked us up from Paramaribo, the capital, and took us upstream to a shallow part of the Suriname River. We joined more than a hundred people who were drinking, dancing and chatting onboard dozens of boats, waterscooters and jetskis. Quite a few people bathed in the lukewarm water; everyone clutched a beer and food was served from the boats. As a guest, I wasn\u2019t allowed to pay.\nMy hangover was nursed in Paramaribo\u2019s historic inner city which is on Unesco\u2019s world heritage list. The people here have a mixed heritage with ancestry from Asia, Africa, Europe and America, and there is also mutual respect between faiths, symbolised by a synagogue that borders a mosque on Kaiser Street, only 800 metres from Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral, one of the world\u2019s biggest wooden buildings.Stay at Hotel Palacio, Paramaribo, doubles from \u00a362\nWorld\u2019s 75th least-visited country;668,000 tourists a year\n Santo Ant\u00e3o, the westernmost island of Cape Verde and indeed all of Africa, is one of the most beautiful places I have ever explored. My girlfriend Caroline was amazed as the minibus took us up the valley to Pa\u00fal, a natural wonder of wild ravines and basalt mountains scattered with colourful small villages and isolated farmhouses. Two people we met told us that this was their eighth visit to this island, the second largest in the Cape Verde archipelago.\nRemember to bring walking boots: the narrow, winding roads will only take you to half of the island, which is twice the size of the Isle of Wight, but the many marked paths make it perfect for hiking. We walked up the steep path from Pa\u00fal to the main road that crosses the island and hitchhiked from there. At a small bar, I enjoyed a cold Portuguese beer and Caroline emptied several glasses of ponche cocktails, made up of Cape Verde grogue (rum distilled from sugar cane), molasses and lime.\nThere is no airport on Santo Ant\u00e3o, so use the twice-daily ferry from Mindelo on S\u00e3o Vicente, the country\u2019s cultural capital, which is worth a visit for its lively nightlife and restaurants. Both islands show you \u201cthe real\u201d Cape Verde, as opposed to all-inclusive destinations Sal and Boa Vista.Stay at Guesthouse Casa Cavoquinho, doubles from \u00a355\nWorld\u2019s 152nd least-visited country; 6.3 million tourists a year\n I may be biased, but my home country is blessed with such spectacular scenery that it is by no means one of the least visited in the world. However, Longyearbyen (the Long Year Town), on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic Circle, is the northernmost major settlement in the world and so attracts fewer visitors. It is as close as many of us will ever get to the North Pole.\nPolar nights on the west coast of Spitsbergen start in mid-November, with 2\u00bd months of total darkness, bar the light of the moon, the stars and the northern lights. The temperature plummets to -40C, so just venturing outside is considered an extreme activity, but snowmobile safaris and dog sledding are popular with those who make the journey to this remote outpost. When I went dogsledding with my sister Kjersti, we watched the aurora borealis and it was so cold that icicles formed on her eyelashes.\nUnsurprisingly, the return of the sun in early March calls for big celebrations with Solfestveka (the sun party week). Even though Norway is one of the world\u2019s most expensive countries, there are no alcohol taxes in Longyearbyen, so there is nothing to dampen the spirits of the three-day party. Then, in summer, the sun never sets on the treeless landscape and people hike and kayak around the clock.

        "content": "The singer-songwriter\u2019s lyric collection is free of explanation yet still explores her curiosity for life and love\nTrust Kate Bush, never one to explain, to complicate the straightforward lyrics collection. She doesn\u2019t annotate this anthology, unlike Neil Tennant\u2019s recent Faber edition. Instead, subtler direction follows an introduction by author David Mitchell, who wrote the spoken-word parts of Bush\u2019s 2014 Before the Dawn performances. Mitchell intermingles charming fannish detail with close textual analysis that illuminates familiar songs: it is God, he points out, not the devil, who allows the man and woman to exchange their sexual experiences on Running Up That Hill, an act of divinity rather than transgression.\nBut Mitchell is wrong on one key point. \u201cKate\u2019s the opposite of a confessional singer-songwriter in the mould of Joni Mitchell during her Blue period,\u201d he asserts. \u201cYou don\u2019t learn much about Kate from her songs.\u201d Which begs the question of how we might know a songwriter. It\u2019s true that Bush\u2019s personal life is so opaque that an interview betraying her Netflix habits offered grounding intimacy. Another where she described Theresa May as \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s happened to us in a long time\u201d burst a bubble some fans were keen to preserve. More dispiriting than partisan matters was her opinion that \u201cit is great to have a woman in charge of the country\u201d. If Bush\u2019s songwriting tells us anything, it\u2019s that her understanding of gender and power is typically more complex.\nThis understanding is one thread of How to Be Invisible, which splits selections from her catalogue across 10 newly curated sections, offering no clear framing devices. (Only Aerial\u2019s A Sky of Honey suite and Hounds of Love\u2019s second side, The Ninth Wave, remain intact.) Here is how we might find her, wedding Snowflake and Hounds of Love into a consideration of the perils of succumbing to love; contemplating alchemy and evolution from Cloudbusting, about a child losing faith in a parent, to Bertie, a tribute to how her son transformed her life. She addresses loss movingly: Aerial\u2019s A Coral Room finds the memory of her late mother in \u201cher little brown jug\u201d; The Fog, from The Sensual World, asks how to love when its objects are transient. Houdini and Get Out of My House bookend her strident interrogation in how to remain open to pleasure but protected from deception.\nTwo sections dwell on gender. Joanni, her portrait of Joan of Arc, is juxtaposed with an indictment of masculine warmongering (Army Dreamers). Later, Bush explores masculine and feminine perspectives, contemplating desire (Reaching Out) and obligation (Night of the Swallow), never reaching trite conclusions.\nIf there is one to be drawn from How to Be Invisible, it isn\u2019t that Bush is unknowable, but that life is: how much can we ever know about love, ourselves, the things we lose? She is never cowed by the uncertainty. Her songwriting suggests the only way to weather it is with curiosity; applying silliness as courageously as literary seriousness, balancing spiritual insight alongside unabashed carnality, domestic truth alongside fantasy, never concerned by contradictions.\nDesire runs wild in the final section: Mrs Bartolozzi\u2019s sexual laundry fantasia; the wily, windy Wuthering Heights. This headstrong pursuit has guided Bush. The question is not what we can learn about her, but what we might learn from following her lead.\n How to Be Invisible by Kate Bush is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

        "content": "Worried that she is speaking French like Joey Essex speaks English, Emma Beddington fights back with classes, podcasts and cartoons about mustard-loving aliens resuscitating literary giants\nI used to think I was pretty great at French: I could handle a subjunctive and disdained the myriad mangled pronunciations of \u201cmillefeuille\u201d on Masterchef. I lived in French-speaking Brussels for 12 years and have a French husband who still tolerates me misgendering the dishwasher after 24 years. My inflated sense of my abilities was bolstered over the years by compliments from surprised French people. Admittedly, the bar is pitifully low for Brits speaking a foreign language: like Samuel Johnson\u2019s dog walking on its hind legs, it\u2019s not done well but people are surprised it\u2019s done at all.\nIn recent years, however, I have let things slide. My French has become trashy: it\u2019s the language of reality and cooking shows (my staple French televisual diet) and easy chat with indulgent friends. I fear I speak French like Joey Essex speaks English, and since we moved back to the UK this year things have got worse. My only French conversation here is with my husband and it runs a well-worn course: who should empty the bin; why we have no money; which of our teenage sons hates us more. When I try to express something complex, I get stuck mid-sentence, unable to express my thoughts clearly. Words that used to be there, waiting to be used, are awol and I have developed a horrible habit of just saying them in English. My husband understands, so who cares?\nBut I care. I can\u2019t bear to lose my French; it\u2019s part of who I am. I even wrote a book about it, for God\u2019s sake. I want to speak the language of Moli\u00e8re, if not like Moli\u00e8re then at least like a reasonably articulate adult. So I resolve to not just stop the rot but reverse it. This will involve a multi-pronged approach: online lessons plus conversation classes, supplemented by a diet of French podcasts and reading, including my third attempt at Les Mis\u00e9rables.\nAu boulot \u2013 to work!\nI take the Institut Fran\u00e7ais\u2019s online test to check my level. It doesn\u2019t seem difficult but my result \u2013 \u201cfirst step to C1\u201d \u2013 is mortifying. I assumed I had C1 (the second-highest level of European official language qualification) in the bag, but if this test could talk it would be saying: \u201cBof.\u201d\nMy first online lessons cheer me up: Frantastique (a learning platform developed with the Institut Fran\u00e7ais, tagline: \u201cSurrender to French\u201d) is a riot. In my first session, I watch a short cartoon in which anarchic aliens incomprehensibly revive a naked, frozen Victor Hugo (beard preserving his modesty), after which I answer grammar and vocabulary questions about it. I enjoy it so much, I do seven lessons in one sitting: Victor visits the alien canteen, but the lack of mustard makes everyone so angry they head to Earth to find more. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve learned \u2013 aliens love mustard? \u2013 but I\u2019m keen for more.\nOne-to-one conversation classes at the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise (which has the mission of promoting French language and culture abroad) are a more serious affair. Christine Grimaud-Brown, my teacher and the director of the York branch, sends me an article on the 21st-century perception of time, no less, to prepare for our first session. It starts off as a relaxed chat and Christine doesn\u2019t correct my mistakes (I secretly yearn for this), but we soon get into fairly abstract territory and speaking to a stranger makes me raise my game. I can tell this will be useful.\nFor extra speaking practice, I try the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Conversation, a twice-weekly chat for French speakers, with a native facilitator. Anything goes, topic wise: on my first session, we cover cricket (including whether French has a word for \u201cwicket\u201d), pantomimes and green energy; later discussions range from Alzheimer\u2019s to cemeteries and Christmas cake. Levels vary although, broadly, the demographic is at the upper end of the scale: my French is tested explaining \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d (\u201ca paper animal in which sweets are placed. One strikes the animal with a stick\u201d) and \u201cHamilton\u201d (\u201ca popular musical of the American revolution utilising le rap\u201d) to other attendees and to universal confusion. I love it, though, and show off dreadfully.\nOn my morning dog walks, I plunge into the rigorous world of Le Nouvel Esprit Public, a geopolitics podcast featuring the kind of French intellectuals who would dip Melvyn Bragg in their caf\u00e9 au lait and eat him for breakfast. They speak in fluid, impassioned sentences about the US midterms or the Italian budget. It\u2019s exactly the kind of French I aspire to. I also enjoy Passions M\u00e9di\u00e9vistes, in which medievalists describe their esoteric research, but it precipitates a minor existential crisis: why aren\u2019t I researching dragons in medieval prayer books? \u201cJ\u2019ai rat\u00e9 ma vie,\u201d (my life is a failure) I mutter, Frenchly.\nFrantastique continues to entertain: Victor Hugo throws a wild party and the aliens hold a pro-mustard demo (\u201cLibert\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9, Moutarde,\u201d reads one placard). Regrettably but predictably, I have become obsessed with my marks. The questions aren\u2019t difficult but I keep making stupid mistakes, to my own fury. Occasionally I feel hard done by: one afternoon my husband comes home to find me incandescent, brandishing a screengrab of a wood-burning stove.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I hiss angrily.\n\u201cEr, un po\u00eale?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a four is it? I lost a mark for not calling it an oven!\u201d\nMy conversation class with Christine is about art, so I read the heap of articles she provides, then write an excruciatingly bad essay. It reads like the work of a pretentious but dim 12-year old. \u201cWhat is art?\u201d I say clunkily, before attempting to describe a Marina Abramovi\u0107 performance (\u201cShe washes the bloody bones of a cow for three days\u201d), giving myself the giggles. In class, though, I really enjoy our discussion, and occasionally feel my lazy synapses creak into action, finding the right word or expression.\nMy reading is patchy. Ga\u00ebl Faye\u2019s excellent novel Petit Pays, about the genocide in Burundi, teaches me \u201cthreadbare\u201d, \u201ccalabash\u201d and \u201cserval\u201d (admittedly, I don\u2019t know what the last two actually are). Les Mis\u00e9rables, however, induces instant deep sleep and \u2013 now that Frantastique has transformed Victor Hugo into a tiny, naked sex god in my mind \u2013 floridly peculiar dreams.\nI test some new podcasts, including Vieille Branche, a series of interviews with older, outspoken and fascinating French public figures (I especially enjoy 88-year-old S&M mistress Catherine Robbe-Grillet). At the other end of the spectrum, I fall in love with Entre: tender, funny conversations with Justine, a sparky and delightful 11-year-old grappling with school, friendships and family. Each episode is five to 10 minutes long, perfect for learners.\nIn class, we discuss fake news. I feel relaxed talking to Christine, but I notice she has a skilful way of pushing me into expressing more complex ideas with her questions. \u201cDoes society still care about truth?\u201d she asks. Or: \u201cIs national character a product of language or vice versa?\u201d Sometimes I answer fluently; sometimes I end up stumbling and stuck.\nThere are signs of progress. I finally stagger up a level on Frantastique, despite my constant blunders. At Caf\u00e9 Conversation, in my capacity as class swot (fayot), I am asked to translate \u201cpick your brain\u201d, \u201cquirky\u201d and \u201callotment\u201d and as I slalom between shoals of tourists when I leave, a hissed \u201cPardon\u201d comes to my lips rather than the usual Yorkshire tut.\nMy Frantastique experience draws to an ignominious close as I cravenly resort to cheating on the spelling of \u201cenvironnemental\u201d. Worse, I get 47% one day, due to my apparent inability to follow simple instructions conjugating the imperfect. I will miss Victor, and G\u00e9rard, a drooling, mustard-crazed alien blob on whom I have a bit of a crush.\nHas my French improved? My general knowledge certainly has: I know more about Breton medieval government, the artist Paul S\u00e9rusier and Armenian politics than I ever anticipated. On one glorious occasion in class, I supplied a word Christine had forgotten (\u201cl\u00e9gif\u00e9rer\u201d, legislate). I have barely started Les Mis\u00e9rables, but already have some vocabulary that would be handy if I were a low-ranking cleric in Restoration France.\nEven so, when I retake the Institut Fran\u00e7ais test, I get that maddening \u201cfirst step to C1\u201d again. J\u2019suis d\u00e9g, as I would say in Joey Essex French. I\u2019m gutted, but I shouldn\u2019t be. \u201cAt your level, progress is much more subtle,\u201d Christine reassures me. I do think something has started to shift: now when my husband and I watch the news, I find myself moved to launch into fluent sentences of Gallic vitriol at the sight of Jacob Rees-Mogg rather than Anglo-Saxon expletives. Better still, I have been powerfully reminded what I love about France and French: that fiercely cerebral public culture and the sheer beauty of its words. In one podcast someone casually uses \u201clacustre\u201d (lacustrine, meaning of or relating to lakes); it\u2019s so lovely I have to stop and write it down. By Victor Hugo\u2019s beard, I will rise above my trash French and become the kind of person who says lacustre.\nFrom vloggeuse to startupeur or swag, most \u201chip\u201d French words are English ones: chatbot, queer and cosplay all entered the Petit Robert dictionary this year. But here are a few that keep a Gallic flavour.\nMecspliquer To mansplain. A mot-valise (portmanteau word) composed of mec (guy) and expliquer (to explain).\nLourd Literally \u201cheavy\u201d, and generally used to mean tiresome, but now, in an adult-bamboozling plot twist, it means good, pleasing. C\u2019est du lourd or \u00e7a envoie du lourd = it is impressive. The verlan (backwards slang) version, relou, is still used to mean annoying, or a pain. All clear? Clair comme de l\u2019eau de boudin (as clear as black pudding water, another great expression).\nPTDR P\u00e9t\u00e9 de rire, literally \u201cbroken with mirth\u201d, the French LOL. Although, of course, most French people use \u201cLOL\u201d.\nP\u00e9cho To seduce, get together with, hook up. Verlan of choper (to seize or get).\nJ\u2019ai le seum I am displeased/angry/disappointed.\nJ\u2019ai failli p\u00e9cho ce gars, mais il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me mecspliquer ma propre th\u00e8se doctorale. C\u2019est archi-relou, j\u2019ai le seum. I nearly hooked up with this guy, but he started to mansplain my own PhD thesis to me. It\u2019s such a pain, I\u2019m gutted.\nGive your conversation a soup\u00e7on of Left Bank va-va-voom.\nLangage \u00e9pic\u00e8ne Also known as \u00e9criture inclusive, this controversial but increasingly popular typography style uses a point m\u00e9dian, a sort of decimal point, to create gender-neutral nouns. So a person reading this would be un\u00b7e lecteur\u00b7rice and the person writing it would be be un\u00b7e journaliste (or un\u00b7e idiot\u00b7e). Last year the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, banned the point m\u00e9dian in official documents with an inflammatory declaration that \u201cthe masculine is a neutral form\u201d.\nJupit\u00e9rien From Jupiter, king of the gods. Applied to Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidential style (he used the term to contrast with the more down-to-earth approach of his predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande), it implies a degree of deliberate distance and grandeur and is now used by his critics to suggest he is haughty or arrogant. Telling a teenager to call you \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident\u201d = jupit\u00e9rien.\nCart\u00e9sien My go-to word to sound intelligent in French. Derived from philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, it\u2019s used generically to mean \u201clogical\u201d or \u201crational\u201d. Du point de vue purement cart\u00e9sien (from a purely rational perspective) is a good (inflammatory) start to a sentence in a French argument.\nCharge mentale Mental load or burden. A hot topic of feminist debate following the publication last year of cartoonist Emma\u2019s Fallait Demander \u2013 You Should Have Asked \u2013 on women\u2019s experience of continually having to anticipate and meet their families\u2019 myriad needs. The Twitter account @chargementale collates some of the most egregious examples of paternal ineptitude encountered by doctors in French paediatrics.\nJ\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 voir tout le temps des crabes autour de moi I started to see crabs around me all the time. Not an everyday expression, but handy if you wish to reproduce Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s ill-advised 1970s experiment with mescaline. Life as a French intellectual is a dangerous business.",

The company told me it is part of their policy and that as they provide alternative free means of payment they are in compliance with the regulation. \nAI, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey\nThe Payment Services Regulations came into force in January and banned traders from levying surcharges on card payments.\nIn its response to you, however, Transferwise claims that surcharges are fine so long as they are displayed upfront and so long as they only reflect the actual cost of processing the card payment.\nIt muddies the waters further in its response to me, claiming that the fee for paying by card is not a card surcharge. \u201cTransferwise offers three significantly different products at three different prices,\u201d it says. \u201cHence there\u2019s no card surcharge as we do not charge based on payment instrument.

It says that since your complaint it has made its prices more transparent on its website.\nThere is plenty wrong with the surcharge ban because cards do indeed cost traders more to process and that cost now has to be passed on to all customers in hidden ways.\nHowever, because local trading standards are the authorities required to enforce it and with shrinking budgets and increasing legislation this is not a priority.\nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute tells the Observer helplessly: \u201cUnder new surcharge legislation, companies based in the UK cannot charge a fee to consumers using a credit card to make a purchase or transfer money. Ultimately, only a judge can decide whether a company or organisation has broken the law.\u201d\nThe campaign group Which? says that the law is clear \u2013 to stop customers being penalised for paying by card \u2013 and traders should be called out for flouting it.\n\u201cWe are hearing stories of people continuing to pay card fees, with some companies still passing on extra charges to their customers,\u201d says Gareth Shaw of Which?\n\u201cThe government and regulator need to closely monitor the impact of the ban, as well as look at the interchange fee regulation and the charges companies pay for processing card payments, to ensure that the reforms have the positive outcome for consumers originally intended.\u201d\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

        "content": "Brexit and trade wars still spooking the markets \u2013 plus, how we did with last year\u2019s tips\nWhat a difference a year makes. After the record highs for global markets in 2017, 2018 was decidedly volatile, characterised by big swings as investors tried to navigate their way through mounting uncertainties. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic have fallen this year, with the FTSE 100 falling 12.5% during 2018 and the Dow Jones enduring a wildly volatile year.\nIn a weak year for stock markets, dominated by concerns over Brexit, trade wars and rising US interest rates, our own picks for 2018 were very disappointing. Between them our 10 tips lost an average of 27.7%.\nAmong the biggest fallers were the trainers and hoodie retailer Footasylum in a very tough year for high street sales. The firm scaled back plans to open new stores, reported a first-half loss in October, and warned of \u201cdifficult trading\u201d.\nAnother big faller was 888, as our bet that shares in the online casino firm could be boosted by a takeover approach or merger didn\u2019t come off. Allied Minds, Prudential and easyJet were also among our major fallers.\nThe Gym Group proved to be the exception, with shares rising 24.1% in 2018 as the low-cost gym chain appealed to a growing membership. Its acquisition of easyGym helped to accelerate expansion plans, and average revenue per member per month increased, adding to factors that pleased investors.\nThe Guardian\u2019s business desk strikes a particularly cautious note in its tips for 2019 \u2013 (probably) the year that Britain will leave the EU under circumstances that nobody knows and with implications that nobody fully understands. That said, here are our best guesses for the year ahead.\nThe year could well be one of economic turmoil. If so, investors will rush to store their money in more defensive stocks that are unlikely to be hit too hard by Brexit, trade wars or a global slowdown. A fall in discretionary spending would still affect Diageo, which ended the year at \u00a327.95, but the booze giant also has a good international spread, meaning stronger markets can help offset weaker ones. Let\u2019s face it, if times get tough we may all have good reason to drown our sorrows. Rob Davies\nGSK surprised investors by announcing a break-up of the business in December, giving it something it had long been clamouring for. The drugmaker will spin off its Panadol and Sensodyne consumer healthcare unit into a joint venture with Pfizer within three years, retaining majority control. It is the second bold move by chief executive Emma Walmsley, after the acquisition of US cancer specialist Tesaro for a hefty \u00a34bn. The deal shows Walmsley is serious about beefing up GSK\u2019s pharma business, and its new HIV 2-drug regimen and shingles vaccine Shingrix look promising. GSK, at \u00a314.91, has also given assurances on the 2019 dividend. Julia Kollewe\nAt \u20ac7.02, ScottishPower\u2019s giant Spanish-listed owner looks a good bet for 2019. The company\u2019s global push into wind and solar has seen it performing strongly in recent years, and this looks set to continue. In the UK, ScottishPower has exited fossil fuel power and said it will bid in a key government auction for offshore windfarm subsidies. The UK energy price cap will hit its supply business, but that\u2019s a wrinkle in an otherwise attractive prospect. Adam Vaughan\nThe storm clouds might be gathering for the global economy with Britain at the centre ahead of Brexit, but one potential safe haven for investors could be the industrial warehouse sector. With a growing number of UK companies stockpiling in preparation for possible border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit, warehouse space is in demand. Consumers are also shifting their shopping online, raising demand for industrial \u201cshed\u201d space to handle internet orders.\nAlthough it\u2019s already had a good few years, Segro, at 588.6p, could benefit further as the biggest warehousing company in the FTSE 100. It also benefits from diversity, with locations outside the UK in Germany, France, Poland and elsewhere across the EU. Richard Partington\nBT\u2019s new boss Philip Jansen arrives on 1 February with a mandate to revive the embattled telecoms group. Outgoing chief executive Gavin Patterson has already started the job, having announced 13,000 job cuts  over a three-year period as part of a \u00a31.5bn cost-cutting drive. It falls to Jansen to address lingering strategic questions, such as the future of its Openreach subsidiary, after shareholders \u2014 and activist investor Greenlight Capital \u2014 pushed for a spin off this year. He will also have to decide whether its multibillion pound sports broadcasting rights strategy is a good use of shareholders\u2019 cash. At 238.1p, there could be plenty to get the shares moving. Zoe Wood\nInvestors in the UK and beyond have reason to be nervous going into 2019, but one company which has a good claim to be better protected than most against Brexit turmoil or the end of an ageing business cycle is Burford Capital. The litigation funder picks juicy court cases it thinks will result in big payouts and backs them with the cash \u2013 more than $3bn so far \u2013 to hire top barristers. Scale and diversification are key in this game, and Aim-listed Burford, at \u00a316.56, is eyeing an enormous and little-served international market. When the tide goes out some companies are left exposed \u2013 and the lawyers (mostly) win. Jasper Jolly\nThe year brings huge uncertainty but the quest for cleaner air and reduced emissions will surely remain high on the global agenda. Johnson Matthey, the sustainable technologies expert, could be well positioned to benefit. Not only is it a leading maker of catalytic converters at a time when European and Chinese regulators are tightening emission rules, it is also developing materials for the rapidly growing area of electric batteries. The company is not immune to the impact of a no-deal Brexit, but it does benefit from a global footprint and diverse sector spread. In November, the company hiked the interim dividend, signalling confidence in its earning potential. At \u00a327.99, it could be one to watch. Angela Monaghan\nMorrisons enjoyed a steady 2018 and has a number of tricks up its sleeve as shoppers uncertain about the impact of Brexit rein in spending. New areas of growth for the supermarket chain including wholesale via Amazon and petrol stations could help to offset competition from the likes of Aldi, Lidl and Tesco. The company is well placed to pick up stores that may have to be offloaded by rivals Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s if their merger goes ahead and the shares, at 213.3p, are also underpinned by rumours of a bid from Amazon. Problems with its deal with McColls and supply difficulties caused by Brexit are potential risks, but the management team seem well prepared to deal with them. Sarah Butler\nVideo games are a massive global market, with more than 2 billion players supporting an industry that is expected to grow from $138bn (\u00a3109bn) this year to $180bn by 2021. Sheffield-based Sumo Group is one of more than 2,200 UK-based games makers hoping to capitalise on that growth. Sumo develops games in partnership with major industry players, such as Sony, Microsoft and Sega, creating products including Little Big Planet 3 for Sony and Sonic and Sega All-Stars. At 118.5p, its shares have climbed more than 3% in 2018 \u2013 although it was trading at more than 180p at one point last year \u2013 with stockbroker Peel Hunt placing a target of 200p on the Aim-listed business. It is an expanding (if loss-making) business, having made two acquisitions last year, and it is protected by customer contracts that have a duration of between 18 and 48 months. Dan Milmo\nSage Group, at 601.4p, has not bombed since the Brexit vote \u2013 although it has recently warned on margins. It is the sort of established company that gives you some kind of confidence that it might not lose you all your money. The accountancy software firm also has a new chief executive, who you assume is trying to make his mark. And it has just announced decent profits, albeit warning about profitability in the future. Not exactly a screaming buy, admittedly. But let\u2019s face it. This is a guessing game, even at the best of times. Simon Goodley",

The International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements. And the setting for Vangelis-tinged vistas in Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner. Despite the great demander of centre-backs Jos\u00e9 Mourinho being banished, Manchester United remain in the market for a replicant Jaap Stam or Nemanja Vidic (both, in fairness, would make an excellent Roy Batty) and while Kalidou Koulibaly may not have seen attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion or even watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh\u00e4user Gate, he is a pretty damn fine defender and one who appears perfect for the Premier League. Napoli have told United the Senegalese will cost \u20ac120m (\u00a3107m) which, given neither we nor probably they know the identity of their next permanent manager, a deal of that magnitude may only be concluded in the summer.\nAt the other end of both the field and price range, Wolves, Huddersfield, Burnley and Crystal Palace all lie in the bottom half of the Premier League for goals scored and the latter three clubs boast Mathias J\u00f8rgensen, James Tarkowski and Luka Milivojevi\u0107 among their top-scorers. It\u2019s no surprise, therefore, to hear of them sniffing around Chelsea\u2019s Tammy Abraham, whose impressive 14 goals in 19 games for Aston Villa could mean his loan is cut short this month, if someone throws sufficient cash the way of Stamford Bridge. Meanwhile, Chelsea have turned their noses up at an initial \u00a320m offer from Bayern Munich for Callum Hudson-Odoi and told the Bundesliga champions to come back with \u00a336m for the winger.\nAnother wanted man, if the BBC is to be believed, is Aaron Ramsey. The Arsenal midfielder can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with clubs outside the Premier League from today and is set to hold talks with Bayern, Internazionale, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He \u201cwill consider moves\u201d to all five and \u201chas not yet made a decision\u201d, although Juventus are \u201cconfident\u201d they are at the front of the queue having offered a package between \u00a331m and \u00a340m. The Mill can only look on in admiration and jealously at Aaron\u2019s life choices.\nAs for another soon-to-be-out-of-contract midfielder with a who\u2019s who list of suitors, 2019\u2019s Mill hasn\u2019t properly shaken off 2018 with Adrien Rabiot yet to leave the party, hanging around the kitchen, tucking into dad\u2019s spirit cabinet, flicking his fringe around and upsetting poor Tottenham Hotspur by declaring they\u2019re \u201cbelow\u201d him. Rabiot\u2019s impending departure to Barcelona/Manchester City/Juventus and PSG\u2019s failure to replace Thiago Motta last summer means Thomas Tuchel wants a midfielder this month and has around \u00a330m to spend. Idrissa Gueye of Everton was the name on various lips last week but Watford\u2019s Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 is also on the shortlist, as is Julian Weigl of Borussia Dortmund, despite them being completely different players, but never let tactics get in the way of a good story. However, that \u00a330m is likely to be well below Watford\u2019s valuation of the 25-year-old.\nLike the most frustrating of evening experiences, it could be one in, one out at Manchester City. Brahim D\u00edaz\u2019s move to Real Madrid should be confirmed any time soon with the 19-year-old already selecting the No 21 shirt once worn by Christophe Metzelder. The only issue is the fee with City trying to insert all manner of clauses in order to bump it up to around \u00a320m. In Brahim\u2019s place will arrive Espanyol starlet Oscar Tarensi, but the versatile wide player can\u2019t sign until January 10 when he turns 16 and therefore will have sufficient fluff on his chin to slip past any unsuspecting bouncers.",

Groundbreaking legislation that forced companies to reveal their gender pay gaps in 2018 for the first time has had an immediate and wide-ranging effect, but companies are likely to come under increased pressure to narrow the gap in 2019, according to data and experts.\nFigures from the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s (CBI) employment trends survey show 93% of businesses are taking action to close the gender pay gap and increase diversity in their workforces, compared with 62% who were asked a similar question in 2017. Companies increasingly appear to recognise the business case for building a diverse workforce, with 60% saying it helps attract and retain staff, while half said it increased skills in the workforce.\nSavvy job candidates are putting more pressure on companies to show they are pushing diversity and gender equality \u2013 with two-thirds of women taking a company\u2019s gender pay gap into consideration, according to research from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. But businesses are also facing a real skillset problem, said Matthew Percival, the head of employment at the CBI.\n\u201cThere is a longer-term problem related to demographics, where businesses need to work hard to broaden their appeal or it will be increasingly difficult to attract the best talent from a diverse workforce,\u201d he said.\nPercival added that the CBI was holding diversity conferences several times a year, which were increasingly oversubscribed. \u201cI think businesses are sincere; they want to understand how to do things differently,\u201d he said. He expected more companies to talk about the work they were doing to reduce the gender pay gap in 2019, but had a warning: \u201cIn year one or year two you might be able to talk about what you are doing but by year three and four you will need to see those metrics moving.\u201d\nThe report, which had 250 respondents employing a total of 1 million people, found half of businesses were putting a greater emphasis on gender diversity at all levels of the company, but only a third were placing a greater focus on gender diversity in their leadership.\nLast year, research showed there were more people called David or Steve leading FTSE 100 companies than there were women or people from ethnic minorities. There were five minority ethnic and seven female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies. Nine bosses were named David and four were called Steve.\nIn April, the requirements revealed almost eight in 10 companies and public sector bodies paid men more than women. The data showed women were being paid a median hourly rate that, on average, was 9.7% less than that of their male colleagues.\nThe gender pay gap expert Helene Reardon-Bond, a former head of gender and equality at the government equalities office (GEO), agreed that executives were coming under increasing pressure both from employees and competitors to demonstrate they were closing their gender pay gaps. Figures due to be published by April 2019 are likely to be closely scrutinised for shifts in either direction.\n\u201cBusiness leaders are competitive \u2013 they don\u2019t want the reputational risk of not publishing, and not being seen to improve,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing to see gender pay reporting become one of the biggest business stories of the year. We were helped by the #MeToo campaign, and the Harvey Weinstein scandal helped throw petrol on the fire \u2013 but we now have people speaking about eliminating the gender pay gap as a business imperative. That is pretty seismic.\u201d\nAbout 1,500 large British companies broke the law by failing to report their gender pay gap in time, but 10,000 employers \u2013 100% of those within the scope of the new law \u2013 reported within 10 weeks of the deadline.\nA study from the Institute for Public Policy Research found 81% of large employers had considered or taken steps to close the gender pay gap as a result of the regulations. It also found that despite initial reservations, four out of five employers were supportive of the gender pay gap reporting rules.\nFollowing the deadline, the GEO published actions that outlined evidence-based suggestions to companies wanting to close their gender pay gaps, including having multiple women in shortlists for recruitment and promotions.\nJoe Dromey, an IPPR senior research fellow, warned that the increased transparency achieved by the reporting rules alone would not tackle pay gaps \u2013 government and employers must address the structural reasons behind pay inequalities.\n\u201cThere are a lot of companies who are just complying with the legislation, but many more are looking at what they can do about the issue,\u201d said Dromey, who added that about one in three companies provided an \u201cadditional narrative\u201d to their figures.\nMany of these were at pains to stress that the company did not have an equal pay problem, and that the reason for the gender pay gap lay in the fact that top earners were dominated by men, and the lowest earners were women.\n\u201cJust these slightly formulaic statements about not having an equal pay problem, those will wear thin if you have a year-on-year significant gender pay gap which is not narrowing,\u201d Dromey said.\nOne challenge facing employers is the fact that some measures designed to lower the gender pay gap in the long term could increase the gap in the short term \u2013 such as hiring more young women. According to the CBI, 24% report they are placing a greater focus on improving gender diversity in entry-level recruitment.\n\u201cThe expectation at a lot of companies and in the economy as a whole is that you need to see progress year on year,\u201d said Dromey. \u201cThe reasons behind the gender pay gap are hard to shift, so there will be a challenge of managing expectations. But the publicity will hopefully push more employers to think what steps they can take.\u201d",

After all, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, it\u2019s now 2019. Our new reality is doing everything it can to wipe the smiles off our faces and it feels like there\u2019s plenty more dolour to come. But in this fortunate corner of the internet, we can take refuge. We can even spread a little light, taking our lead from none other than the immortal PG Wodehouse, who wrote in Something Fresh:\n\u201cAs we grow older and realise more clearly the limitations of human happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding pleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people.\u201d\nThe fact that this line was actually the cue for various witticisms and sarcasms about the mercilessly efficient secretary Baxter and his failure to take pleasure in anything should only encourage us. Wodehouse was serious about spreading joy \u2013 even when he was joking. Something Fresh (the very first Blandings Castle novel) was written and published during the painful early years of the first world war, and must have given its many readers much needed respite. Wodehouse himself didn\u2019t go overboard on such reflections, but perhaps the state of the world was on his mind when he wrote the following about \u201cyoung idiot\u201d Freddie Threepwood:\n\u201cHis was a life which lacked, perhaps, the sublimer emotions which raised Man to the level of the gods, but it was undeniably an extremely happy one. He never experienced the thrill of ambition fulfilled, but, on the other hand, he never knew the agony of ambition frustrated. His name, when he died, would not live for ever in England\u2019s annals; he was spared the pain of worrying about this by the fact that he had no desire to live for ever in England\u2019s annals. He was possibly as nearly contented a human being can be in this century of alarms and excursions.\u201d\nAgain, Wodehouse was joking \u2013 but you can understand how a few hours spent in the company of the Honourable Freddie might come as a relief from worrying about the world.\nJust in case you think I\u2019m advocating too hard for Wodehouse this month, I\u2019m also happy to admit that there are other writers who have also written funny books. Perhaps not quite as funny as Plum, but still wonderful to read. In fact, this could be one of the broadest categories we\u2019ve ever had on the Reading group, offering us a range stretching at least as far back as Aristophanes and his strap-on willies, up to the potential contenders for the new Comedy women in print prize.\nSince I\u2019ve already pushed a personal favourite, I\u2019ll suggest others: Evelyn Waugh\u2019s outstanding Sword Of Honour trilogy, a novel from Anthony Powell\u2019s A Dance To The Music Of Time sequence, or anything by the late great Terry Pratchett. (Almost anything since we\u2019ve already looked at Night Watch and The Colour Of Magic.) On that note, here\u2019s a few of the other funny books we\u2019ve covered on the Reading group to save you from nominating these again:\nGeoffrey Chaucer - The Canterbury Tales\nMuriel Spark - A Far Cry From Kensington and Memento Mori\nSalman Rushdie \u2013 Shame\nJane Austen - Persuasion\nJohn Kennedy Toole \u2013 A Confederacy Of Dunces\nBeryl Bainbridge - The Bottle Factory Outing\nJoseph Heller \u2013 Catch 22\nWhile we\u2019ve already covered a few stone-cold classics, there are still 2,000 years worth of comedy masterpieces to choose from \u2013 including 50 more Terry Pratchett novels and around 75 books by PG Wodehouse. All you have to do to get your favourite into contention is to mention it in the comments below this article. I\u2019ll put all the contenders into the hat towards the end of the week and announce the winner next Tuesday.",

        "content": "Catwalks were quick to adopt counterculture motifs last year so expect the virtue-signalling garments to go big in 2019\nHear the words tie dye and you could be forgiven for imagining surfers, the counterculture and Jerry Garcia. But with nostalgia rarely out of fashion these days, tie-dye prints are tipped to be the throwback trend of 2019 after appearances on the spring catwalks and will soon be on sale at Asos and New Look.\nIda Petersson, the womenswear buying director at Browns, describes this season\u2019s deluge as \u201cthe biggest sighting for a long time\u201d. Her top picks are as broad as they are colourful, and include Prada\u2019s A-line skirts, Ambush\u2019s Hawaiian tie-dye shirts, Stella McCartney\u2019s soft tie-dye dresses and her personal favourite, R13\u2019s tie-dye T-shirts paired with blazers.\nAt the other of the price spectrum, New Look and Urban Outfitters are producing entire lines in neutral tie-dye prints. Asos, ever the yardstick, has a record-breaking number of tie-dye pieces for the new season, including jersey, sweat and underwear, and colours ranging from neon to dark, autumnal shades. \u201cWe are no longer seeing this as just a spring summer trend,\u201d said a spokesperson for the brand.\nSo why tie dye, and why now? The trend is driven by individuality. Owing to the way it is traditionally made \u2013 bunches of fabric are tied with waxed thread so the dye only touches the exposed areas \u2013 no two prints are the same, which is revolutionary in this world of fast fashion. Plus, it\u2019s incredibly versatile as a print, says Petersson. Like other trends, this one might have started on a T-shirt \u2013 \u201cand in terms of silhouettes, of course, the T-shirt will be the easy way to buy into the trend,\u201d she says \u2013 but in 2019 you can expect to see it everywhere. \u201cThe Elder Statesman, the label which \u2018owned\u2019 high-end tie dye for a long time, used it so many different ways and this is what really makes the trend for me.\u201d\nFor some, the idea of a print associated with anti-commercialism being co-opted by high fashion and sold at catwalk prices might leave a bad taste. But tie dye can still be a totem for change and protest at a time when it is fashionable to wear your protest on your sleeve. From the We Should All Be Feminists T-shirts of 2017, to pink pussy hats symbolising women\u2019s rights and political resistance, and more recently the gilets jaunes worn by French inequality protesters, fashion can have a political element. Tie dye was always one way to align with the anti-establishment movement of the late 1960s \u2013 regardless of whether the wearer had any connection to radical politics.\nThe trend is also one of the few success stories of how high fashion can translate into what people are actually wearing. \u201cThat tie dye became a commodity that was ultimately produced using industrial techniques \u2026 demonstrates the willingness of industry insiders to turn to the street for inspiration,\u201d writes Jennifer Grayer Moore in her book Fashion Fads Through American History.\nPerhaps the final element is sustainability, with tie dye a visible indicator of both artisanal printing methods and organic materials, which include 2019 favourites crochet, lace and weaving. However, most of these pieces are not produced in the traditional way, so there is an element of virtue signalling going on. Still, all for a good cause \u2013 even if you can\u2019t name a single Grateful Dead song.",

Set in the blistering heat of a remote Australian town ravaged by drought and threatened by bushfires, this is a complex, meaty, intelligent mystery.\nMartin Scarsden is a journalist with PTSD who is sent by his editor to Riversend (population 800). A year earlier, the town\u2019s charismatic young priest inexplicably shot dead five members of his congregation, before he was killed himself. Martin is writing a \u201cone year on\u201d piece, but soon finds himself drawn into the mystery of why Byron Swift summarily executed these five men in this town as \u201chot as Hades\u201d.\nHammer\u2019s writing is so evocative the heat practically rises off the pages of Scrublands; a scene where the town\u2019s men fight a bushfire is brought to life in terrifying style. He gives his story deliciously noirish overtones, from the gorgeous bookseller with \u201ctroubled green eyes\u201d named Mandalay Blonde (\u201cEveryone calls me Mandy\u201d), to the gloriously named local drunk, Harley Snouch, and the Black Dog Motel. Plagued by nightmares and insomnia, \u201csomehow, in this dried-out town, [Martin] can feel his blood beginning to course once again\u201d.\nFrom devastating heat to snow: in Lucy Foley\u2019s The Hunting Party (Harper Collins) a group of old friends from university travel to an exclusive lodge in the remote Scottish Highlands for New Year. We know from the start that this reunion isn\u2019t going to go well. By 2 January, a body has been found and a huge snowstorm means the party can\u2019t leave the property. Foley goes on to carefully, slyly circle the truth, moving her narrative back and forth between the discovery of the murder and the friends\u2019 arrival in the lodge. They might have known each other for years, but \u201ceven as they laughed and jostled and teased one another, I could sense something underneath it \u2013 something off\u201d, the lodge\u2019s manager, Heather, tells us.\nMoving between characters \u2013 the attractive one; the successful plain one; the newcomer to the group \u2013 it quickly becomes clear that there is a lot these old friends are hiding from each other.\nFoley excels at the small details that make up a person. Beautiful, vain, life-and-soul-of-the-party Miranda is skewered by her best friend Katie, who reveals her as someone who will turn up with a fake tan and \u201csay something like, \u2018Oh yes, I spent a lot of time in the sun recently \u2013 I tan so easily\u2019 and abruptly change the subject\u201d.\nFoley builds the tension cleverly and creepily, underlining the point that old friends aren\u2019t always the best. \u201cI look around at the others. They\u2019re all grinning, but their faces, in the light thrown from the Lodge, look strange, spectral, and their smiles look like snarls,\u201d says Miranda.\nLizzy Barber\u2019s debut My Name Is Anna (Cornerstone) is one of those thrillers in which it is almost impossible not to flick ahead: it\u2019s the story of a little girl who was kidnapped in Florida as a toddler. Fifteen years later, the story flits between her point of view \u2013 now the daughter of a Carrie-style religious mother, unable to stop dreaming of a name that isn\u2019t hers \u2013 and that of her younger sister, trying to live a normal teenage life in London while a media circus continues to hound her family, and her mother obsesses over her whereabouts, \u201csmothering me with all the excess love she has, enough for three of us, not two\u201d.\nSometimes Barber\u2019s notes of doom are a little overwritten \u2013 even tulips have \u201ctight-lipped petals on the verge of spilling their secrets\u201d \u2013 but for me, this was a genuine gallop to the denouement.\n To order any of these titles for a special price, click on the titles, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

        "content": "Club hope little-known manager Jos\u00e9 Gomes and promising youngsters can stave off relegation after a historically bad 2018\nWith 2019 merely hours old, trite platitudes and empty resolutions are all the rage. \u201cNew Year, New Me\u201d and all that, but no team will be more desperate to usher in a new era than Reading, who, for a while, have wanted to see the back of the worst year \u2013 statistically \u2013 in the club\u2019s history.\nThe Royals picked up a miserly 36 points (from 138), the lowest tally in the Football League over the past year. The numbers make grisly viewing, yet things may get worse before they get better.\nReading head into Tuesday\u2019s match with Swansea without a win in nine and with only one since October. They have mustered three goals in their past eight matches and, although Ipswich\u2019s woes prevent them from propping up the Championship, the threat of League One looms large, 18 months on from coming within a penalty shootout of promotion to the top flight.\nIf they are to escape from danger, then much rests on Jos\u00e9 Gomes, the Portuguese who was given the task last month of helping Reading rediscover their glow and effervescence. Gomes \u2013 whose name was recommended to the Chinese owners by the increasingly influential Kia Joorabchian \u2013 is a risky appointment. His work includes brief spells in Greece, Hungary, Saudi Arabia and the UAE but, thrown into the deep end of a relegation battle, Gomes, who has a two-and-a-half-year contract, knows time is of the essence.\nThe soundbites have been promising, if a little wild \u2013 \u201cI will put Reading in the Premier League\u201d \u2013 and the early signs encouraging but Reading require more than charisma to haul themselves clear of the drop.\nOff the field there remain questions over the ambitions of Yongge Dai and Xiu Li Dai, the brother and sister who acquired the club in 2017 but have rarely spoken publicly. There has also been upheaval. Brian Tevreden (who brought Jaap Stam to the club) left as technical director in September and two months later Ron Gourlay resigned as chief executive. Tevreden\u2019s replacement, Gianluca Nani, has swiftly exited while Nigel Howe replaced Gourlay and sacked Paul Clement as manager a day after returning to that role.\nAs for Joorabchian, the businessman behind Philippe Coutinho\u2019s move to Barcelona, he has again wooed the Reading hierarchy after working with Pairoj Piempongsant, who brokered the sale of the club in 2014. Joorabchian was influential in the unsuccessful signings of Orlando S\u00e1, Paolo Hurtado, Ola John and Lucas Piazon. It remains to be seen what activity Reading, who have a bloated squad, do in January.\nAfter Stam came within spitting distance of delivering an unlikely promotion, the club invested in the following months in an effort to go one better. Too many signings have simply not worked \u2013 Sone Aluko and Sam Baldock are among those yet to fire \u2013 but there is a talented young spine emerging. The academy has always been a source of pride and in Liam Kelly, Andy Rinomhota and Danny Loader, they have another wave of talent to be excited about.\nThere is particular intrigue around Loader, the striker prolific at youth level and a World Cup winner with England Under-17s; his older brother, Ben, is a wing for London Irish, tenants at Reading\u2019s Madejski Stadium for the past 18 years. If Gomes can tap into their quality and eke out more from players such as John Swift, another guilty of underwhelming this season, then Reading can prosper.\n\u201cHe [Gomes] hasn\u2019t had long and hopefully after a busy period we can get more work done on the training ground and become more clinical when we get the ball in the final third,\u201d Swift said. \u201cHe wants us to play with freedom, get at players and when we are in the defensive area to move it nice and quick. Hopefully we can go into 2019 and really push on and get some wins on the board.\u201d\nThe overriding priority is victory against Swansea but, with an FA Cup trip to Old Trafford on the horizon, there is a sense of what might have been. It is a land of ifs and buts, though had Reading, instead of Huddersfield, prospered at Wembley 18 months ago a new year visit to Old Trafford could well have been a Premier League fixture.\nIf Reading are to return to the top tier, from which they were relegated in 2013, they have a long road ahead. \u201cWhen I looked to the fixture schedule, I thought I could play against a Portuguese coach, but he left,\u201d Gomes said of Saturday. \u201cBut we are talking about one of the best clubs in the world with great players. It will be very difficult for us.\u201d\n Graham Coughlan has thrown his hat into the ring for the Bristol Rovers job after three consecutive wins as caretaker manager. The 44-year-old former Plymouth defender was placed in charge after Darrell Clarke\u2019s departure last month and could not have wished for a better audition for the role on a permanent basis. \u201cIf anybody wants this job, they\u2019ll have to fight me for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t make the calls. But I know the call I would be making if I was in that position, but I am not so it is not up to me.\u201d\n Aitor Karanka\u2019s job at Nottingham Forest remains in peril, with a poor result at home to Leeds on New Year\u2019s Day likely to spell the end for the Spaniard. Forest are 10th in the Championship and winless in five matches, with the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, increasingly agitated at the failure to mount a serious promotion challenge after an aggressive, and expensive, summer recruitment drive. After defeat at Millwall on Saturday, Karanka said: \u201cThe only thing I can tell you is that I am doing everything in the way said when I signed the contract. The agreement was to build a team like I did at Middlesbrough.\u201d\n Aston Villa have failed to score only once in the league but they have been conceding far too many goals for Dean Smith\u2019s liking. Bolton and Reading boast better defensive records but the return of Tommy Elphick from a loan spell at Hull should help bring order to the chaos. The 31-year-old, who captained Bournemouth to promotion in 2015, was a key figure in Hull\u2019s recent revival and will provide Villa with some much-needed defensive nous. \u201cI wanted to be a part of what the manager\u2019s doing going forward,\u201d Elphick said. \u201cIt\u2019s a style and a way of playing that I\u2019m very used to and had great success under Eddie Howe, and Gus Poyet before that.\u201d",

        "content": "Prolific owners are said to have safety concerns about home of jumps racing, where their Starchitect died in 2017\nThe Guardian has had confirmation from a trainer that the Rooney family, Paul and Clare, have decided to have no further runners at Cheltenham. The extraordinary move, apparently motivated by concerns over safety at the track, was reported in Tuesday\u2019s Racing Post but no sources were cited and as yet there has been no public explanation from the Rooneys themselves.\nThe Rooneys have become the most prolific British owners of jumps horses in recent times and only JP McManus has had more runners or winners over the last four years. They had a winner at the Cheltenham Festival in 2017 when Willoughby Court carried their dark blue and yellow colours to glory in the Neptune Novice Hurdle but had a dismal experience at the track later that year when Starchitect broke a leg while running between fences in the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup.\nAlthough Tom Scudamore was able to react quickly and steady Starchitect to a stop, the horse\u2019s life could not be saved. The horse had been clear of his rivals with two fences to jump when injury struck in what was clearly a traumatic incident for all involved.\nHaving had 17 runners at Cheltenham last season, the Rooneys have only had two there this winter and none since Lovely Job was fifth over fences there in November. Their One For Billy had seemed on the point of winning at Cheltenham in October when he ran the wrong way on the run-in, crashing through a tape that was intended to keep the runners straight past an intersection.\nThe Rooneys have had plenty of runners in jumps races elsewhere in recent days but it might be said that their string was set up with Cheltenham in mind, making their decision the more surprising. They have horses with Nigel Twiston-Davies, Fergal O\u2019Brien, Kim Bailey, Tom George and Jonjo O\u2019Neill, all based within a few miles of the course.\nAn official at Cheltenham indicated the course would not respond until the story was confirmed but a statement is likely later on Tuesday, when the track hosts its annual New Year\u2019s Day race-meeting. The course was recently the subject of a large-scale review in response to seven equine fatalities at the Festival last March, when a series of recommendations were made by the sport\u2019s ruling body, including a reduction in field-size.\nOne unanswered question is whether the Rooneys are still happy to have runners over the Grand National fences at Aintree. They were second in the 2016 National through The Last Samuri but had no runners in the Becher Chase or the Grand Sefton this season. The Last Samuri ran in the most recent National in April but was moved from Kim Bailey\u2019s yard to Harry Fry\u2019s in the autumn and his only race since has been at Ascot.\nVenetia Williams is the trainer in form, with four winners from five runners over the last two days, and she could strike at Cheltenham with Shalakar (2.35) in the staying handicap hurdle. He\u2019s put in a couple of fair efforts this season but this big step up in distance to three miles should be a help, in light of the way he stayed on to score at Ludlow in April.\nThis is only Shalakar\u2019s third run in a handicap since he joined the yard from France, so the six-year-old has plenty of scope for progress. He\u2019s 7-1 and seemingly attracting support.\nEarlier, there\u2019s 10-1 about Sir Mangan (12.50), who could come good in the staying handicap chase after a couple of second places in recent months. Dan Skelton\u2019s veteran was a bit unlucky with the way a three-runner race panned out at Doncaster but this bigger field here could help him, Harry Skelton returns to the saddle and blinkers are fitted.\nDefi Du Seuil (1.25) is a backable 3-1 for the Dipper Novice Chase, having travelled well on his way to his first chasing success at Exeter last month. I think he has too much speed on this ground for these rivals, but has to jump a whole lot more cleanly than he did here on his chasing debut in November.\nCheltenham 12.15 Anemoi 12.50 Sir Mangan 1.25 Defi Du Seuil 2.00 Dustin Des Mottes\u00a02.35 Shalakar (nap) 3.10 Clyne 3.50 Cascova\u00a0\nCatterick 12.25 Vamanos 1.00 The Herds Garden 1.35 Duke Debarry 2.10 See The Sea 2.45 Lord County 3.20 Inchcolm\u00a0\nMusselburgh 12.30 Hannon 1.05 Knock House 1.40 Knockgraffon 2.15 Irish Roe 2.50\u00a0Kajaki 3.25\u00a0Just Minded\u00a0\nSouthwell 12.35 Hanati 1.10 Kommander Kirkup 1.45 Something Lucky 2.20 Angel Palanas 2.55\u00a0Tagur 3.30 Bond Angel\u00a0\nExeter 12.40 Extra Mag 1.15 Ebony Gale 1.50\u00a0Caribert 2.25 Achille (nb) 3.00 White Moon 3.35 Cap Du Nord 4.05 Mister Timmytucks\u00a0\nFakenham 12.45 Blu Cavalier 1.20 Sideways 1.55\u00a0Kilbrew Boy 2.30 Todd 3.05 Walsingham Grange 3.40 Kings Inn",

        "content": "The 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup is set to be the most competitive yet and England, who meet Scotland in their opening game on 9 June, are genuine contenders\nJill Ellis did not ponder the question for long. The USA\u2019s English-born manager had just been asked if France 2019 would be the most competitive Women\u2019s World Cup to date and her answer spoke volumes.\n\u201cIs it going to the hardest to win?\u201d mused the coach who led her adopted country to glory in Canada four years ago. \u201cWell, every World Cup should be bigger and better than the one before and, in terms of the standard of the teams alone, I think France is going to be a spectacular tournament.\u201d\nWith 24 countries competing across nine venues from Valenciennes to Montpellier and Le Havre to Grenoble, the tournament has doubled in size since the USA beat Norway at Fifa\u2019s first formal World Cup, in China in 1991.\nBack then media coverage was limited. As recently as Canada 2015 only three UK newspapers sent dedicated reporters to watch England secure a bronze medal \u2013 but that will change in France where British journalists are scheduled to descend on masse. Some will arrive in Nice \u2013 where Phil Neville\u2019s England face Shelley Kerr\u2019s Scotland in their opening game on 9 June ready to cast critical eyes over a branch of the sport they may be new to.\nThe challenge confronting England\u2019s Fran Kirby, Scotland\u2019s Kim Little and their fellow star players is to capture the hearts and minds of both the mainstream media and British television audiences. The reaction at home could well determine whether England\u2019s newly all professional Women\u2019s Super League finally starts attracting the attendances and commercial deals required for long term sustainability.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s football is at a bit of a tipping point at the moment,\u201d says Casey Stoney, the former England captain turned Manchester United manager. \u201cIf England win this World Cup it might just tip it to where we want it to go. It\u2019s going to be an exciting tournament in a good timezone for television.\u201d\nThe final, in Lyon on 7 July, could perhaps do with a tranformative Brandi Chastain-type moment. No one should underestimate the importance of a sultry Californian summer\u2019s evening in 1999 and the single swipe of Chastain\u2019s left foot which converted a penalty against China to win the USA the World Cup.\nAs she celebrated by whipping off her shirt to reveal a black sports bra, the 90,185 crowd - a record live attendance for an international women\u2019s sporting event - inside Pasadena\u2019s Rosebowl swayed to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Let\u2019s Get Loud. Admittedly Chastain\u2019s iconic cameo would eventually be seen as a starting gun for evolution rather than revolution but, temporarily at least, the world woke up to female football\u2019s potential.\nSponsors facilitated a North American professional league only to find its durability would prove the sort of mirage more usually found in the Mojave desert. Two decades on, the US league is in its third incarnation, the previous two having folded, while the WSL is Europe\u2019s sole professional divison.\nThe latter\u2019s inaugural season has attracted stubbornly low crowds, often in the hundreds for high calibre games. It is easy to see why the Football Association is so desperate for England to secure the World Cup trophy it feels would galvanise the domestic game.\nWhen is it?\nFrom 7 June- 7 July 2019. After the 24 teams are culled by an initial group stage, the last 16 knockout games take place from 22-25 June, the quarter finals from 27-29 June, the semi-finals on 2-3 July and the final on 7 July.\u00a0\nWhere is it? \nAt nine venues across France \u2013 Paris, Reims, Rennes, Valenciennes, Le Havre, Grenoble, Montpellier, Nice and Lyon. The final and semi-finals are in Lyon. England and Scotland are paired with Japan and Argentina in Group D and meet in their opening game in Nice on 9 June. Lionesses fans face a lengthy trip to Le Havre for the second game against Argentina on 14 June before returning to the Riviera to meet Japan five days later. Scotland play Japan in Rennes on 14 June and Argentina in Paris on 19 June.\u00a0\nWho progresses from the six groups?\nThe top two and four best third placed sides. Depending on position, England and Scotland could have trips to two of Valenciennes, Rennes, Le Havre and Grenoble at the round of 16 and/or quarter final stages.\u00a0\nWho are the favourites?\nThe USA as defending champions, Germany, France, England, Canada, Australia. While Japan, the 2011 winners, were runners up to Jill Ellis\u2019s side at Canada 2015, England finished with a bronze medal after beating Germany in the third place play-off.\nDark horses?\nSweden, Spain, the Netherlands.\u00a0\nPlayers to watch? \nAlex Morgan scored 18 goals in 19 games for USA in 2018 but England possess a brilliant playmaker in Fran Kirby and outstanding right back in Lucy Bronze, while Kim Little has the midfield talent to make Scotland\u2019s World Cup debut one to remember. Then there\u2019s France\u2019s Amandine Henry and Wendie Renard, Germany\u2019s Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n and Lieke Martens of the Netherlands.\nWhat has Bob Marley got to do with it\nJamaica, aka the Reggae Girlz, have become the first Caribbean country to qualify for a Women\u2019s World Cup finals and they did it thanks to financial help from the Bob Marley Foundation following the intervention of the late singer\u2019s daughter, Cedella Marley. \u201cDaddy would not be surprised,\u201d she says.\nWhere to buy ticket?\nFrom Fifa\u00a0- assorted packages are available.\nThese days Neville\u2019s star players, Lyon\u2019s Lucy Bronze among them, can command six-figure salaries from club and central England contracts but a little lower down the pecking order, a sense of fragility feels pervasive. Tellingly, the majority of players at WSL Yeovil earn the minimum wage with such inequality and insecurity at least seeming in step with some of the wider world\u2019s troubles.\nWith somewhat unfortunate timing, December\u2019s glitzy tournament draw in Paris \u2013 which placed England and a Scotland side participating in their first finals in the same initial group as the not to be underestimated 2011 winners and 2015 finalists Japan \u2013 coincided with a weekend of violent anti government protests across France\u2019s capital.\nIf the gilets jaunes will presumably be appeased by June and the bubble wrap surrounding Fifa events invariably transforms tournament venues into temporary Narnias, terrorism remains a threat.\nThe men\u2019s 2016 European Championship finals passed off peacefully but France\u2019s security services remain mindful of the danger.\nSuch fears were evident in a stadium lift at Valenciennes in October 2017 when England played a friendly against France and an armed policeman spotted a journalist apparently lacking an identifying \u201cmedia personnel\u201d lanyard. It had merely become hidden beneath a coat but the speed with which the officer readied his gun seemed instructive.\nNeville is currently honing England\u2019s preparations to out-manoeuvre fellow contenders, including the US, Germany, Canada, Australia, Japan and France in securing prize money worth $4m to the winners - or $34m less than Didier Deschamps\u2019s men earned for triumphing at Russia 2019.\nWhile Neville needs to prove he is as smart a tactician as his predecessor Mark Sampson \u2013 sacked for non-football reasons \u2013 France\u2019s Corinne Diacre is under pressure to emulate Deschamps\u2019 achievement.\nAfter spending three largely successful years as the first woman to coach a French men\u2019s team, second tier Clermont, she should be tough enough to get the best from a talented, yet arguably flaky, squad yet remains cautious.\n\u201cMy objective is to at least reach the semi-finals but we\u2019re outsiders,\u201d says Diacre. \u201cThe USA are favourites, they have a winning culture.\u201d",

A man in his 30s was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody.\nNational security officials in government, police and security services were helping the investigation into the incident in which the British Transport police officer was stabbed in the shoulder, a man and woman in their 50s sustained abdominal injuries, and the woman received wounds to her face.\nManchester city centre police said the incident just before 9pm was one of several \u201cserious crime incidents\u201d overnight, with 15 arrests being made and a total of 120 incidents recorded since 7pm on Monday.\nThey said in a tweet just after 6am on Tuesday that officers had \u201cdone a great job of looking after people in the city\u201d.\nThe former chief constable of Greater Manchester police Sir Peter Fahy commended the courage of the officers who dealt with the station incident.\n\u201cIt would certainly appear police officers showed incredible bravery in tackling the attacker at Manchester\u2019s Victoria station last night, saving lives,\u201d he said.\nGreater Manchester police said the cordon at the station would be lifted soon, but a large police presence would remain in place. They also said the officer who was attacked, a sergeant in his 30s, had been released from hospital.\n\u201cYou will see more officers in and around the station throughout the morning but this is not as a result of any increased threat,\u201d the police said. \u201cPlease follow directions from officers on the ground and speak to them if you have any concerns.\u201d\nRob Potts, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said officers were keeping an open mind about the attack. \u201c[The] events will have understandably worried people but I need to stress that the incident is not ongoing. A man is in custody and there is currently no intelligence to suggest that there is any wider threat at this time.\u201d\nSam Clack, a BBC producer, who was waiting for a tram when the attack took place, said: \u201cI just heard this most blood-curdling scream and looked down the platform. What it looked like was a guy in his 60s with a woman of similar age and another guy all dressed in black.\n\u201cIt looked like they were having a fight, but she was screaming in this blood-curdling way. I saw police in hi-vis come towards him. He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good 12-inch blade. It was just fear, pure fear.\u201d\nClack said he heard the man shouting \u201cAllah\u201d during the attack. \u201cHe shouted it before, he shouted it during it \u2013 Allah.\n\u201cThe guy, his exact words were, he said: \u2018As long as you keep bombing other countries, this sort of shit is going to keep happening.\u2019\u201d\nHe said police used a stun gun and pepper spray on the man before \u201csix or seven\u201d officers jumped on him. \u201cIt was scary. I have never been so scared in my life. Someone with a knife six to eight feet away, he had just stabbed someone. It was the proximity. It just highlights the fact that it can happen anywhere.\u201d\nJust been very close to the most terrifying thing. Man stabbed in Manchester Victoria station on tram platform. Feet from me, I was close to jumping on the tracks as attacker had long kitchen knife. Totally shaken. This is seriously messed up. pic.twitter.com/CnUw7j2TOT\nThe North West ambulance service said it sent three vehicles to the incident and took all three victims to hospital for treatment. While the station was closed after the attack, the city\u2019s fireworks display in Albert Square went ahead amid increased security.\nThere have been no major terrorist attacks in the UK for the past year but MI5 and the police say they remain extremely busy dealing with 700 investigations into suspected terrorism. In 2017, there were five terrorist attacks \u2013 four in London and one in Manchester.\nThe terrorism threat level for the UK remains at severe, meaning an attack is assessed as being highly likely.",

But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact \u201cmegaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals\u201d.\nMacron said this hatefulness was \u201cthe negation of France\u201d and that \u201cour future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation.\u201d He said he had \u201cseen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable\u201d in recent weeks and that \u201corder\u201d in France would be maintained.\nMacron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for new year\u2019s celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protestrs.\nAbout 300,000 tourists and revellers were expected on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es on New Year\u2019s Eve for Paris\u2019s annual light show, which is projected on to the Arc de Triomphe and was the target of protesters this month. A security cordon was set up around the area from 4pm and security guards and police checked those who entered. Some gilets jaunes demonstrators called for peaceful protests in Paris.\nOver the past decade, hundreds of cars have been set alight on the edge of French cities including Strasbourg and Lyon on New Year\u2019s Eve in what has become a kind of end-of-year ritual. But officials said security services were on alert for unannounced anti-government protests in order to prevent violence.\nThe gilets jaunes movement, named after protesters\u2019 hi-vis vests, began in November as a tax revolt against a new fuel duty. It has morphed into a nationwide protest against what has been seen as an unfair and unjust tax policy, and Macron\u2019s measures favouring businesses and the wealthy. Rioting, arson and running battles with police have occurred on the edge of demonstrations in Paris and other cities.\nIn his new year speech, Macron acknowledged the anger that had spread across France and tried to empathise. But he said it had been brewing for a long time \u2013 implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation.\nMacron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it \u201cshowed us that we\u2019re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future\u201d.\nHe was careful to use the words \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated at a desk in a gilded room, this time Macron stood up in a more modern room in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\nAfter some in Macron\u2019s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits.\nHe said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: \u201cThe results can\u2019t be immediate, and impatience \u2013 which I share \u2013 can\u2019t justify any kind of giving up.\u201d He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless \u201cultra free-market\u201d capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a Europe that \u201cprotects\u201d.\nMacron said one of his key wishes for 2019 was \u201ctruth\u201d, including a fight against inaccurate information online. This suggested that Macron might seek to go further on regulating information online, after his government passed a law which aims to empower judges to order the immediate removal of news deemed as fake during election campaigns. He did not give details.\nGilets jaunes demonstrators have called for referendums and a greater role for citizens in everyday politics. Macron said \u201cour institutions must continue to evolve\u201d but didn\u2019t spell out any possible changes to the political system. He has promised to launch a national debate from January and said only that he would write to citizens to set out the parameters in coming days.\nThe European elections in May will be a major test for Macron\u2019s political party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, which is behind Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally in the polls. Macron said in his speech that he would soon set out a project for Europe.\nA year ago, Macron said in his new year\u2019s address: \u201cIn my view, 2018 will be the year of national cohesion.\u201d But instead he ends the year with a nation deeply divided, with violent street protests against him, and with his approval ratings reduced from about 40% to 20% over the course of 2018.\nHe is also again under pressure over the scandal of his former bodyguard and security aide, Alexandre Benalla, who was sacked this summer after he was filmed acting violently to demonstrators.\nThe Benalla affair was back in the headlines this week over the former aide\u2019s continuing use of diplomatic passports. He also claimed he had remained in personal contact with Macron. The affair has proved damaging in part because of the Elys\u00e9e\u2019s botched handling of it, making statements that were contradicted and giving the impression of a cover-up. The Elys\u00e9e on Monday dismissed his claims as invented.",

        "content": "\u2018The Nation\u2019s T rex\u2019 will stand upright for the first time in 66m years alongside 720 specimens as part of a five-year overhaul \n\u201cHe\u2019s decapitating a Triceratops,\u201d Siobhan Starrs observes casually. \u201cYou want drama with the T rex. We\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d\nThe gory scene, worthy of Jurassic Park, is frozen in time in the 31,000sq-ft fossil hall at the popular Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, which reopens to the public on 8 June after a massive overhaul spanning five years and costing $125m.\nThe Nation\u2019s T rex, as this individual is known, will stand about 15ft tall, upright for the first time in 66m years, in this new exhibit, alongside more than 720 specimens, including dinosaurs, plants, animals and insects, ranging in size from a 90ft long Diplodocus to pollen grains of a millimetre.\nTo the dismay of countless parents looking for diversions on rainy days, the grand fossil hall closed in 2014 for the biggest building renovation in the museum\u2019s history. With its 1910 architectural grandeur and ornate craftsmanship restored, what was once colloquially known as the Hall of Extinct Monsters will now be called The David H Koch Hall of Fossils \u2013 Deep Time, in recognition of a $35m gift from the controversial conservative billionaire David Koch.\nThe Smithsonian Institution\u2019s 19 museums and zoo contain everything from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s last silk stovepipe hat to Charles Lindbergh\u2019s Spirit of St Louis, but there had always been a T rex-shaped hole in the collection. Visitors to the old hall had to make do with a cast replica.\nBut 30 years ago a Montana rancher, hiking with her family on land managed by the US army corps of engineers in the Hell Creek Formation, made a startling discovery. Digging with a garden shovel and jackknife, Kathy Wankel unearthed a complete T rex arm. A local expert excavated the rest. In 2014 the specimen was loaned to the Smithsonian for 50 years and now the skeleton has been assembled.\nIt is an especially important T rex because of \u201call the debate about why the tiny little arms\u201d, said Starrs, project manager in the museum\u2019s office of exhibits. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complete specimen for T rexes and it has the most complete arm ever found, including all digits, which helped advance science because this is an ongoing question: how coulda truly predatory dinosaur can take down prey if its arms are almost vestigial looking?\n\u201cWe present this as a question of open science in the exhibition because it really isn\u2019t fully resolved, but they were probably scavengers and predators both, so they were just the perfect eating machine. If they came across something that was already dead they would scavenge. But they also were truly predatory at the same time.\u201d\nStomping on and biting the hapless triceratops, the T rex is not alone in playing to the gallery. Starrs (\u201cI have kids so of course I love Jurassic Park\u201d) explained: \u201cIt definitely was an important goal of ours that we wanted things to be as lifelike as possible, which doesn\u2019t always mean high drama. So we\u2019ve got predatory scenes like with our T-rex, which is clearly a dramatic moment, but then we also have ones where they\u2019re slumbering or gently scratching the side of the face.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to capture all phases of life, not just the most dramatic. Our Allosaurus is where we decided to take a predator and put it in in a surprising pose, a nesting scene, so it\u2019s sitting with a clutch of eggs within its protective tail curve. The idea is to make them both scientifically accurate and make you start thinking about them as a living organism that lived in a real place in an ecosystem with other living things around it, just like organisms do today.\u201d\nOther highlights in what is billed as the most visited room in the most visited natural history museum in the world include the first fossil to be given the name Stegosaurus as well as a Mastodon rearing up under a quotation from Charles Darwin: \u201cFrom so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\u201d There are also some new acquisitions. Starrs said cryptically: \u201cThe most exciting one was a recent gift I can\u2019t really talk about but it\u2019s going to be great when visitors see it.\u201d\nDuring the hall\u2019s shutdown, all specimens were removed for conservation and study by Smithsonian scientists in a network of specially created labs and storage units in the bowels of the museum (\u201cNo social media post please\u201d reads a sign with red lines through Facebook, Twitter and camera symbols). The biggest and heaviest fossils were disassembled and transported to \u201cdino builders\u201d Research Casting International near Toronto in Canada, where they were repositioned into more scientifically accurate poses.\nIn some cases it was almost like a second excavation.\nA Gorgosaurus skull, for example, that had been half-embedded in plaster during a previous preservation process turned out to have a complete other side with even a full row of teeth. The first Ceratosaurus ever found, tantalisingly inaccessible to scientists for more than a century because it was half-buried in a museum wall, was labouriously extracted with hammer and chisel and power tools.\nSteve Jabo, a preparator proudly surveying the Ceratosaurus cast that will be displayed on its back in a losing fight against the Stegosaurus, explained: \u201cIt was locked in the wall in 1910. We didn\u2019t know what the back would look like. The skull was smashed flat \u2013 it just happens geologically \u2013 but we had a guy who makes moulds reinflate it to 3D instead of being pancaked.\u201d\nThe gallery will depict life on earth\u2019s epic journey of more than 3.7bn years, teasing out themes and fundamental questions around natural selection, ecosystems changes and mass extinctions.\nIt also comes with a timely message about the impact of us. Starrs said: \u201cWe\u2019re using the past as a point of entry and understanding the human footprint on the planet today. That\u2019s revolutionary.\n\u201cAre we headed to another mass extinction and are we driving that as a species? It was an asteroid and now is it humans? We tackle these questions in the exhibition which I\u2019ve never seen done in a fossil hall before.\u201d\nYet the hall will carry David Koch\u2019s name. He and his brother Charles have sent at least $100m directly to 84 groups denying climate change science since 1997, according to Greenpeace. David Koch\u2019s donation comes at a time when museums are under greater scrutiny than ever over their sources of funding. Last April protesters gathered at the Smithsonian\u2019s Arthur M Sackler Gallery of Art to focus attention on what they claim is the wealthy family\u2019s role in the opioid crisis.\nRandall Kremer, the director of public affairs at the Natural History Museum, said: \u201cThe question certainly comes up but we don\u2019t vet our donors on anything more than whether they believe in the mission. In the case of Mr Koch, he\u2019s been on the board of the museum for a decade and is one of the preeminent philanthropists in the United States. Beyond that, it\u2019s not an issue.\u201d",

All of them are children\u2019s bedrooms, or at least the space they sleep in, exhibited in photographs displayed by the Foundling Museum, in London.\nMore than 30 pictures by Katie Wilson expose the dispiritingly grim living conditions of families in poverty and form Bedrooms of London, an exhibition that could be one of the most challenging of 2019.\n\u201cThere is something very haunting about the images,\u201d said Caro Howell, the director of the museum. \u201cIt is the absences, the absence of space for a child to walk in, or learn to walk in, or play in. The absence of toys, the absence of privacy. Because the people are not there, the environment is speaking for them, they are very haunting.\u201d\nThe photographs will be shown alongside first-hand narratives of the families. There is, for example, the tiny hostel bedsit of Amelie, a baby\u2019s cot next to the mother\u2019s sofabed and no room for the child to crawl; then there is the story of Sainey, 32, who went to London aged 15 as a domestic slave, never left, and cannot work because she is in the country illegally and cannot afford clothes for her growing children.\n\u201cBedrooms are supposed to be a place of comfort and emotional safety and love,\u201d said Howell. \u201cA child\u2019s bedroom is supposed to be a physical manifestation of the love that those surrounding it feel. Seeing the images brings you up short.\u201d\nThe project is the outcome of two years\u2019 engagement with families by the the Childhood Trust, a London charity that is also producing a book and report to send to policymakers.\nThe trust\u2019s chief executive, Laurence Guinness, said some of the hostels in which people were forced to live were like open prisons. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re living in a cell. You can go out whenever you like but you\u2019ve got no money to go and do anything. You can\u2019t really escape, people are trapped.\u201d\nWhen they set out on the project they assumed most children would have their own bedroom. \u201cEven a child poverty charity can be naive about child poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cThose at the very bottom don\u2019t even have a bedroom any more.\u201d\nThe exhibition will be at the museum which is dedicated to the history of the Foundling hospital, founded by Thomas Coram in 1739 as \u201ca hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children\u201d.\nIt was an obviously appropriate venue, said Howell, as it put the subject in a 300-year context. \u201cI hope visitors to the show will leave and think: \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019 It may be something as simple as donating, but it may also be about getting more deeply involved in a grassroots charity in [your] own neighbourhood. As the Foundling hospital shows, we all have the capacity to make things better.\u201d\nGuinness said he hoped the photographs would be shown in parliament, where policymakers can take action.\nBut while the families featured in the photographs were down, they were not out, he said. \u201cWe got them together recently to let people comment on the pictures and the report. They were very motivated to help.\n\u201cThe overriding question was: \u2018How can this create any change?\u2019 That\u2019s all we\u2019re interested in is change. We are not defeated yet.\u201d\n Bedrooms of London at the Foundling Museum, 8 February-5 May 2019.",

It is wonderful to know that so many individuals are prepared to step in and help others, even whilst government policy condemns people to the streets.\n\u201cBy working together we can make the UK a more hospitable place, where people are able to live in safety, and where what brings us together is greater than what separates us.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s award-winning coverage of the Windrush scandal focused in many cases on individuals supported directly by our appeal charities. The charities\u2019 work ensured their clients were not unjustly detained or deported, and in some cases meant they received the vital NHS treatment wrongly denied to them.\nHowever, the charities said, despite the government\u2019s acknowledgement of the Windrush problems, the injustices are continuing. They said they anticipated similar problems arising for EU migrants after Brexit, with long-established UK residents struggling to provide documentation to prove they have a right to be in the UK.\nJulie Bishop, the director of Law Centres Network, said: \u201cWe can all do something to push back against the hostile environment. Law centres use their legal know-how to get justice for people who have been excluded and restore their dignity.\n\u201cWe are grateful that so many readers are joining the fightback through their generous donations. Together we can bring down this cruel policy.\u201d\nThe total raised so far includes \u00a345,000 pledged by readers during the appeal telethon in December, and nearly \u00a310,000 raised by Guardian and Observer staff through fundraising events.

        "content": "Workers announced launch of union push in response to working conditions as company says it does not recognize allegations\nAs Amazon\u2019s workforce has more than doubled over the past three years, workers at Amazon fulfillment center warehouses in the United States have started organizing and pushing toward forming a union to fight back against the company\u2019s treatment of its workers.\nAmazon\u2019s global workforce reached more than 613,000 employees worldwide according to its latest quarterly earnings report, not including the 100,000 temporary employees the company hired for the holiday season.\nJust a few months after Amazon opened its first New York-based fulfillment center in Staten Island, workers announced on 12 December the launch of a union push with help from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.\n\u201cAmazon is a very big company. They need to have a union put in place,\u201d said an Amazon worker who requested to remain anonymous. The worker has been with the company for two years and was transferred to Staten Island when it opened in October 2018. \u201cThey overwork you and you\u2019re like a number to them. During peak season and Prime season, they give you 60 hours a week. In July, I had Prime week and worked 60 hours. The same day I worked overtime, I got into a bad car accident because I was falling asleep behind the wheel.\u201d\nOther employees cited working conditions as one of the prevailing factors for wanting to form a union. \u201cI support the effort. They have to be more supportive toward their employees,\u201d said another Amazon employee in Staten Island. \u201cRight now, at that fulfillment center, if an employee is a picker, they want that person to pick up 400 items per hour, picking each item every seven seconds.\u201d\nThey noted that to keep up with that hourly rate, workers cannot take bathroom breaks or they risk Tot (time off task points) that could be used to justify job termination.\nIn a statement during the announcement of the union push, picker Rashad Long claimed workers are overworked, pressured with frivolous disciplinary actions and security lines at the exit cut into breaks and extended work shifts, unpaid.\n\u201cWe are not robots. We are human beings. We cannot come into work after only four hours of sleep and be expected to be fully energized and ready to work. That\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Long. \u201cI feel like all the company cares about is getting their products out to the customers as quickly humanly as possible, no matter what that means for us workers in the end.\u201d\nAmazon said in a statement: \u201cTo claim Staten Island workers want a union is not a fair representation of the vast majority of the employees at this site.\u201d\nIn Minnesota, workers at several Amazon facilities were the first to force management to the bargaining table over the past few months after workers held protests in the summer.\n\u201cThe end of September and October, we had private meetings with Amazon management,\u201d said Nimo Omar, an organizer and founder of the Awood Center, an east African worker-led organization in the Minneapolis area. \u201cWe met with Amazon management, and we had workers from across five different warehouses in that meeting talking about working conditions at Amazon, from warehouse workers to truck drivers who deliver packages to some of the leads in these warehouses as well.\u201d\nWorkers held a rally outside the Shakopee fulfillment center on 14 December to continue to pressure Amazon to improve conditions for workers.\n\u201cIf you get injured, they don\u2019t treat you well, they don\u2019t care,\u201d said 24-year-old Hibaq Mohamed, who has worked at the Shakopee facility for over two years. She said every two to three months, Amazon increases hourly productivity rates workers must meet to keep their jobs. \u201cDuring summertime, we don\u2019t get enough AC, in the winter we don\u2019t get enough heat. We want to change the imbalance at Amazon.\u201d\nHafsa Hassan, 21, who has worked at the fulfillment center since July 2017, claimed managers create a hostile work environment that prevents workers from seeking proper medical treatment, taking bathroom breaks, or reporting safety issues.\n\u201cA lot of workers aren\u2019t comfortable going to managers and that has a lot to do with rate. There\u2019s an obsession with rate,\u201d said Hassan. \u201cThe rate people have to make every single hour, every hour it\u2019s mentioned, and if a person isn\u2019t doing well, the managers will pick on them. Sometimes you can hear it from different departments.\u201d\nAmazon said it \u201cdid not recognize\u201d these allegations. \u201cWe work hard every day to ensure all of our employees are treated fairly and with dignity and respect,\u201d the company said.\nAmazon fulfillment centers aren\u2019t the only part of Amazon where workers started organizing efforts in 2018. The online retail giant bought Whole Foods in August 2017 for $13.7bn. A little over a year later, workers launched Whole Worker, a unionizing effort in response to changes made by Amazon since the acquisition. Shortly after the group announced its founding, an employee leaked an Amazon training video where managers were taught how to discourage labor organizing efforts.\nIn a 9 December email sent out by Whole Worker leaders to thousands of Whole Foods employees, the group announced solidarity with other organizing efforts across Amazon, including co-hosting a rally in Queens against the HQ2 project. \u201cWhile we pursue our long-term goals, we are looking for other ways to collectively use our voices regarding unfair and potentially illegal compensation practices,\u201d said the email. \u201cWe at Whole Worker believe that all Whole Foods and Amazon team members deserve a say in our workplaces and that coming together to negotiate a contract as a formal union is the only way to ensure that our voices are truly heard.\u201d\nIn an email, an Amazon spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cAmazon maintains an open-door policy that encourages employees to bring their comments, questions, and concerns directly to their management team for discussion and resolution. We firmly believe this direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the needs of our workforce.\n\u201cWe provide a $15 minimum wage for all US hourly employees, opportunities for career growth, industry-leading benefits, and hands-on training using emerging technology. Associates are the heart and soul of our operations, and in fact, they are also our number one recruiter for new hires by regularly encouraging friends and family to apply for roles. We encourage anyone to compare our pay, benefits and workplace to other major employers across the country.\u201d",

        "content": "It was a coincidence that the MCC scheduled its winter 1918 committee meeting on 12 November, though if pressed Lord Hawke might have professed it presentiment and canny planning. Either way, on the very first day after the armistice, the MCC\u2019s ordinary committee got together to get on with the business of organising the next domestic schedule. They had a lot to talk about. Through four years of war, there had been no county cricket at all. Now it was back, no one seemed to agree exactly what it should be. Opinion was split. On the one side were the reactionaries, on the other, the reformists.\nWhich is a row that seems to have been around as long as the game itself. The old joke is that the English invented cricket to give themselves some conception of eternity, but really they did it so they\u2019d have something to bicker about during it. There\u2019s always talk that something must be done. And occasionally something actually is, something more than the constant tinkering and tampering with schedules and formats that means no two seasons ever seem to be quite alike, something significant, like the launch of the Sunday league or the T20 trophy.\nIn 1919, the Bolsheviks wanted to enlarge the stumps, extend the overs, and expand the playing hours, to cover the pitches, cut the matches, shrink the bats, reduce the playing days, and limit the number of professional players. Someone even suggested they ban all the left-handed batsmen, just to save the minutes wasted changing the field over. A century before Twenty20, the Observer argued the MCC should organise three-hour county matches, because \u201cthe normal attendances on the county cricket grounds would be doubled after the tea interval if spectators were assured 90 minutes of healthy hitting\u201d.\nThe MCC did what any good English institution would in such circumstances, and set up yet another committee to investigate. It was a stormy winter, with much frothing, seething and spluttering. At the national papers, over-worked letters editors must have consoled themselves with dreams of what they might buy with all the overtime they were earning. Eventually, the pronouncement came down that all matches would now last two days rather than three, and that playing hours would be stretched till 7.30pm, \u201cto give workers an opportunity of seeing more of the game\u201d. Everything else would remain the same, except for tea, which, in the most drastic step yet, would now be taken on the field \u201cto save time\u201d.\nSo 1919 was one of the great revolutionary seasons in the history of English cricket. And now, 100 years later, we\u2019re about to have another. Two, in fact, back-to-back. This time, the outbreak of reformist zeal is an overdue attempt to blow the game out the doldrums its been in for the last decade, when participation has dropped, and public enthusiasm dwindled. The remedies the ECB has come up with now are even more radical than the MCC\u2019s 1919 plan to speed up the tea break.\nBetween this April and September 2020, there will be a World Cup and the Ashes, as well as an overhaul of the county championship, and the launch of a new format, The Hundred. There can\u2019t have been a run of summers quite like it.\nThe ECB has been building towards these two seasons for the last four years. It\u2019s restructured the central contract system to make sure limited-overs players were earning as much, or more, as Test match specialists, and encouraged players to prioritise the IPL. They hired Trevor Bayliss, because, as their old director of cricket Andrew Strauss said over and again back then, he was such a good limited-overs coach. And it\u2019s stuck with him since, even while the Test team stalled, because the ODI side was playing better than ever.\nThe county championship, meanwhile, was stripped of its star players and shunted away from high summer so that everyone could play limited-overs cricket when the sun was out. Next year, it will change again. The 50-over competition is crammed into May, the T20 Blast final jammed into late September, and the championship split into chunks and spread out around the out-grounds to make room for the World Cup. The ECB at least had a good argument for doing all this, even if it wasn\u2019t one everyone liked. The tournament is, as CEO Tom Harrison has said, a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d opportunity. Whisper it, but it feels like the ECB is well set to take advantage of it.\nThen there\u2019s The Hundred. This has so far infuriated millions of people who like cricket, but, we\u2019re told, will appeal to the many more millions who don\u2019t, yet, but might if only it didn\u2019t resemble cricket so much. The ECB has blown through \u00a365m in cash reserves in the last two years, and the cost of launching the new competition has ballooned to more than \u00a340m. This is why it\u2019s also had to make so many cuts. And cuts mean compromises, mainly to its development programmes. The overseas placement scheme\u2019s been scrapped and so has its specialist pace and spin bowling projects.\nIn 1919, by the way, the new dawn of English cricket turned out to last just half a season. That August, the MCC scrapped the new two-day format and by 1920, everything was back as it had been in 1914. A century later, these latest changes won\u2019t be so easily undone. The ECB has staked almost everything on England making a run to the final of a home World Cup in 2019, and the newly enthused public falling in love with The Hundred in 2020. Right now, the first proposition looks a better bet than the second, but the ECB can\u2019t really afford to be wrong about either.\n This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

A statement in Russian did not provide further details about the individual who was detained or information about the alleged spying, but his name appeared to transliterate as Paul Whelan.\nThe US state department declined to comment on whether the detained individual was a former marine, but in response to a question from the Guardian it said it was aware that a US citizen had been detained, had been notified of his detention by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, and said it was seeking access to the individual.\n\u201cDue to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time,\u201d the department said.\nIn an email to the Guardian, Whelan\u2019s twin brother, David, said Whelan was attending the wedding of a fellow former marine, who was marrying a Russian woman.\nWhelan\u2019s family said he had been to Russia \u201cnumerous times\u201d, as far back as 2007, and was currently working on a corporate security team for BorgWarner, which is listed online as a Michigan-based maker of automative industry components.\nDavid Whelan said his brother had previously been to Russia as a visitor and for his work for Kelly Services, a management consultancy.\nThe Guardian could not immediately verify the accuracy of the family\u2019s statement.\nWhelan\u2019s previous trips to Russia, his brother said, were only for short visits and he had limited Russian language abilities \u201cother than to be able to get around\u201d.\n\u201cThis visit was entirely for pleasure, from what I understand,\u201d his brother said.\nThe family said they had learned of Whelan\u2019s arrest on Monday after reading the news reports.\n\u201cWe noticed that he was not in communication on the 28th, which was very much out of character for him even when he was traveling,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are deeply concerned for his safety and wellbeing. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.\u201d\nA BorgWarner representative confirmed that Whelan was employed as the company\u2019s global security director, responsible for overseeing security at the company\u2019s facilities in Michigan and \u201cother company locations around the world\u201d.\nIt is not clear whether any US officials have seen Whelan since his arrest. The family said they had been in contact with their congressional representatives, the US embassy and the state epartment, where many officials were on furlough due to the US government shutdown.\nThe family said they believed a 72-hour window for the US government to be able to visit Whelan had already started and they had not been in contact with anyone who had seen or been in contact with Whelan since 5pm (Moscow time) on 28 December.\n\u201cWe are hoping he will be able to return home soon,\u201d the family said.\nThe wedding party had been staying at the Metropol hotel in Moscow.\nWhelan\u2019s arrest came just weeks after a Russian national named Maria Butina pleaded guilty to secretly acting as a Russian agent in the US. It is not clear whether Whelan\u2019s detention was an attempt to retaliate for Butina\u2019s arrest, which is a sore point in US-Russian relations.",

        "content": "Thatcher-era cabinet minister Norman Fowler is at centre of efforts to slim down chamber\nThe House of Lords needs to reduce the number of \u201cpassengers\u201d who contribute little to the upper house, an issue caused in part by the mass creation of life peers under Tony Blair and David Cameron, the Lord Speaker, Norman Fowler has said.\nThe Thatcher-era cabinet minister who has been Speaker for the past two years is at the centre of efforts to slim down what he believes is a bloated chamber, from its current near-800 to a planned ceiling of 600.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Fowler said that while the majority of peers contributed significantly to the chamber, factors such as a lack of screening for political appointees meant some new arrivals had little idea of what their role entailed.\n\u201cYou do have extraordinary cases where people have come in and after a few days they\u2019ve come to the conclusion that, actually they\u2019re in the wrong place doing the wrong thing \u2013 or rather not doing the wrong thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the last thing we want in the House of Lords is passengers.\u201d\nBlair created 374 life peers during his premiership, while Cameron ennobled 260 people \u2013 as against fewer than 40 each by Gordon Brown and, so far, Theresa May.\nAsked if such an influx diluted the quality of the Lords, Fowler said: \u201cIt\u2019s partly unfair, because there were some good people who came in. What I think is fair to say is that on that, as with other appointments, there was no process in which they came before a commission and it was explained to a prospective new peer what was involved in the job.\u201d\nMichelle Mone\nThe lingerie millionaire, made a Conservative life peer by David Cameron in 2015, has faced calls to step down after it emerged she missed almost 90% of sittings in the last parliamentary year. Lords records show she has spoken in the chamber three times in three years, and she is not a member of any committee.\nDigby Jones\nThe former CBI chief is a vocal supporter of Brexit \u2013 but does rather less in terms of shaping the nation in the Lords. Elevated in 2007 by Gordon Brown so he could be a junior business minister, Jones was initially busy in the Lords. But since 2014 he has spoken just six times.\nPeter Truscott\nThe former MEP and Labour junior minister became something of a poster child for Lords reform after it emerged he had claimed nearly \u00a357,000 in allowances and expenses in a year, during which he spoke in the chamber just three times. In 2009 he was suspended from the Lords for six months for offering to amend a bill in exchange for money.\nPaul Hanningfield\nA former Conservative council leader who was made a peer in 1998, he was jailed for nine months in 2011 for claiming almost \u00a314,000 for overnight stays in London when he was not in the capital. Since then, he has spoken in the Lords five times, the last being in January 2016.\nMichael Heseltine\nSome argue that the patchy record of the Tory former minister \u2013 who spoke three times in 2018 \u2013 shows attendance is not everything. Lord Fowler notes that while Heseltine rarely contributed, when he did, \u201che made an extraordinarily good speech\u201d, such as in recent Brexit debates.\nAs Speaker, Fowler has led efforts to reduce numbers. The process, undertaken by consensus, involves encouraging peers to retire and limiting the number of new arrivals, and is already exceeding its targets.\n\u201cI do think it is completely crazy that we have a system at the moment where the size of the House of Lords is totally open-ended,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI know of no assembly in the western world, or any other world for that matter, where there isn\u2019t a limit on the numbers. It isn\u2019t a revolutionary thing to say.\u201d\nAfter a Christmas break, the Lords will be braced for another potential round of to-ing and fro-ing over Brexit legislation, as amendments shuttle between the houses.\nIn June this process resulted in the government making concessions on the power of MPs to shape Brexit, after a series of defeats in the upper house. However, Fowler downplayed the possible influence of the Lords: \u201cIt\u2019s important that people don\u2019t get over-excited about an amendment, because by the process of ping-pong it goes back, obviously, to the House of Commons.\n\u201cLast time we were told we were destroying the legislation \u2013 we didn\u2019t destroy it at all. All that the Lords did was say: \u2018Will you think again on this particular question?\u2019 The Commons did and came to the same conclusion.\n\u201cIt may be famous last words but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to change the whole process itself. That process has got to be decided in the Commons.\u201d\nFowler was speaking from his large corner office in the Lords, formerly used by the lord chancellor, with double-height panelled walls and views directly on to the river Thames.\nIt was, he said, something of a contrast to his debut as an MP in 1970. \u201cIt\u2019s taken something like 50 years to get to an office like this. The first office I ever had, I shared it with Ken Clarke on one side, John Prescott on the other and Cyril Smith at the end. It was over Boots, the chemist. I\u2019ve steadily come up the scale.\u201d\nLeaning in the fireplace was a poster bearing the slogan \u201cAids: don\u2019t die of ignorance\u201d, a legacy of Fowler\u2019s tenure as heath secretary, when the HIV crisis first gained prominence.\nFowler, who has since become a celebrated champion of LGBT rights, briefly broke his political neutrality to say that equal marriage should be extended to Northern Ireland: \u201cI think it should be a United Kingdom process. It shouldn\u2019t be a matter of debate any more.\u201d\nFor all the advances on Aids \u2013 last month the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle announced to the Commons that he was HIV positive but could live an entirely unaffected life \u2013 Fowler said it was a \u201ctotal scandal\u201d that almost a million people a year still died from the disease, mainly in poorer counties.\n\u201cWhen I have finished with this job, it is one of the things that I intend to return to, for the years that are left, to campaign on that,\u201d he said.\nFowler also said some attitudes on HIV remained stuck in the past. \u201cThere has been a substantial change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been total. I had the other day a peer who came up to me after a series of question before World Aids Day, and said: \u2018You know, in my view it\u2019s just all self-inflicted\u2019. And you think: \u2018Really?\u2019\u201d",

        "content": "The chain that democratised British fashion has lost out to Instagram and online retailers\n2018 was not a vintage year for fashion. The crisis-hit House of Fraser and an embattled Marks & Spencer made headlines, as did a rising tally of planned store closures, and accompanying job losses, deemed necessary in a turnaround plan for New Look. The Orla Kiely brand, famed for its geometric prints, went into liquidation in September, while Dolce & Gabbana ends the year under serious pressure, having been dropped by important retailers after a racism scandal shipwrecked a fashion show planned in China.\nBut the most significant downfall to impact on the culture of fashion is that of a store still very much open for business. The undoing of Philip Green, and by association Topshop, is a watershed moment for British high street fashion.\nHit by multiple accusations of bullying and sexual harassment, Green was further humiliated by being dropped by as a business partner by Beyonc\u00e9, who cut ties between her Ivy Park athleisure brand and Topshop after the allegations. The launch event for Topshop\u2019s keynote partywear collection this season, a collaboration with the up and coming designer Michael Halpern, was cancelled at the last moment. There will be no star-studded parties celebrating Topshop\u2019s place at the centre of the British fashion ecosystem this year, for the simple reason that it can no longer lay claim to that position.\nTopshop was facing problems before the claims surrounding Green. All along the high street, an existing decline began to steepen in 2018. Turnover in 2017 at Arcadia Group, the umbrella for smaller brands such as Dorothy Perkins and Burton as well as flagships Topshop and Topman, had already fallen by \u00a3113m, or 5.6%, on that of the previous year.\nThis decade has seen the young shoppers who are Topshop\u2019s key market moving from bricks-and-mortar shopping, a field in which Topshop was dominant, to online, in which it faced stiff competition from new and nimble, social media-savvy, price-competitive brands such as Boohoo and Missguided. Furthermore, the BHS pension scandal of 2016 had cut into the personal fortune of Green and his wife, Tina, and forced him to step back from the limelight.\nThe Topshop catwalk shows at which Green would position himself centre-stage, once a biannual sight at London fashion week, have been consigned to history. In his pomp, Green gave himself the prime paparazzi spot each season: next to Kendall Jenner in February 2014, Cara Delevingne in February 2015, Anna Wintour in September 2015, and Kate Moss in September 2017.\nIn 2018, however, there were no Topshop catwalk shows at London fashion week. The programme of sponsoring catwalks for emerging designers, along with the lavish champagne-soaked hospitality that became a symbol of Green\u2019s status, was already being pegged back by the beginning of this year.\nWhile few tears have been shed for Green, the decline of Topshop illustrates another shift in fashion: the end of a golden age of the high street. From the early 00s to the beginning of this decade, Topshop was the poster child for a fashion culture in which glamour and newness were democratised and made available to shoppers on a mass budget for the first time. Catwalk images had previously been a closely guarded secret in the months during which clothes shown at fashion week went into production, which meant high street retailers operated on a six-month time lag, unable to begin work on high street versions of the \u201cnew look\u201d until the designer clothes went on sale.\nThe internet changed all that. Images became immediately available, enabling savvy high street teams to interpret the trends and deliver them to suit their customers just as fast as Bond Street. Topshop \u2013 thanks to a talented and largely female team led by Jane Shepherdson \u2013 exploited this opportunity better than anyone else, delivering up to the minute, well-priced fashion.\nGreen\u2019s heavily stage-managed front row photo opportunities signified more than just the roarings of his rampant ego. Having Vogue cover girls attend a Topshop fashion show reflected a time when fashion\u2019s class system appeared to have melted away.\nIt was not to last. The latest hemlines, as decreed by the most chic designers in Paris or the colour-dominating catwalks in Milan, had once been thrilling plot twists that kept fashion customers hooked. Now that all of fashion\u2019s secrets were out in the open, these plot twists \u2013 otherwise known as trends \u2013 lost their power over women\u2019s shopping habits.\nTopshop\u2019s cachet had been based on being the closest a high street shopper could get to catwalk fashion. But in making it accessible to all, Topshop helped devalue the currency of biannual trends, and the audience ebbed away to find excitement elsewhere \u2013 in street style, streetwear, or Instagram, in a new generation of social media-oriented brands.\nAt the same time, a growing awareness of the conditions of workers producing fast fashion and of the environmental impact of throwaway styles dimmed the lustre of fashion as a playground for all. The current crisis has been brought about by a man of whom few are fond, but in its pomp Topshop was a shop millions of women adored.",

        "content": "Edoardo Ballerini \u2013 who has recorded more than 250 titles \u2013 says audiobooks are an art form in their own right\nThe increasing popularity of audiobooks has raised recorded narration to the level of a new art form, according to the man whose 133-hour version of an epic autobiographical novel has sealed his status as one of its foremost practitioners.\nThe Italian-American actor Edoardo Ballerini has recorded more than 250 titles in an audiobook boom that has seen sales double in five years. Like many in the audiobook world, he believes this commercial success has coincided with a creative flourishing.\nHe says the potential of book narration became apparent after his marathon recording of the English language version of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s acclaimed six-part book series, My Struggle.\n\u201cNarrating these books was not only personally extraordinary, but at the vanguard of the evolving art of narration,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nThe completion of book six this year, for the New York-based Recorded Books, marks the end of a project that has taken five years to finish. The six volumes clock in at more than 133 hours, one of the the longest commercial recordings by a single narrator and almost twice as long as unabridged recordings of the Bible.\nBallerini says recording My Struggle was the most difficult job in a 23-year acting career that has included roles in The Sopranos and the film Dinner Rush.\nFeedback from listeners highlighted how audiobooks, and the way they are consumed on smartphones, provide an intimate new way to reach audiences, he says. \u201cThe relation between narrator and listener has become much more personal. You\u2019re in their home, lying in bed with them, in their cars, in the gym, or wherever it. It\u2019s very one-on-one, there\u2019s no sound or visual effects, it is just a voice in their heads.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWith the Karl Ove recordings people have written me in very personal ways about their experience of listening, which I\u2019ve not gotten from any other project.\u201d\nAn artist told Ballerini she heard his voice in her paintings after listening to him reading Knausgaard as she worked. Another fan sent him pottery she said Ballerini\u2019s recording had helped her to create. A couple who were stranded by snow for weeks said the My Struggle recordings helped them survive the winter.\nSome take issue with Ballerini\u2019s description of it as a new art form. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has run a a talking books service for more than 80 years.\nDaryl Chapman, the studios manager at the RNIB, says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say narration is a new art form, rather one that\u2019s been evolving over time.\u201d\nOral storytelling dates back to the earliest days of human language. \u201cCultures often venerated professional story tellers even though they weren\u2019t generating new stories so much as re-telling the old ones,\u201d says Joseph Devlin, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London.\nDevlin\u2019s research found listening to stories increased people\u2019s emotional engagement more than watching video.\n\u201cI agree with Ballerini that there is an intimacy in the audio format. As a listener you engage more by virtue of co-creating the content with the narrator.\u201d\nPaul Stokes, the founder of the blog Audiobook Reviewer, says: \u201cIn less than 10 years, the world of audiobooks has exploded. Using smartphones enables listeners, authors, and narrators to connect on many different levels.\u201d\nHe cites the example of Soundbooth Theatre, which runs live narrations based on YouTube requests, allowing audiences to have a say on how characters are read.\nKnausgaard approved the casting of Ballerini to read his books, but the two men have never met. \u201cI was afraid meeting the man would shatter some things, and I\u2019ve not even listened to him speak,\u201d Ballerini says.\nBut now that the project is complete, he is keen to meet someone he regards as \u201cthe author I was born to narrate\u201d. Ballerini treasures a signed copy of book three of the series in which Knausgaard describes him as \u201cmy American voice\u201d.\nHad the thought this was a \u201cbad\u201d year because I missed out on two film projects I wanted. Then realized I completed the greatest, most difficult, project of my career, narrating 3,600 pages of #KarlOveKnausgaard. Decided it was a great year. #perspective #gratitude pic.twitter.com/B9PnE8JIK8\nBallerini says he sometimes found it difficult to get out of character, when channelling Knausgaard. \u201cI felt like it had gotten under my skin so deeply. It was like he was opening a window for me to see my own life. Maybe that\u2019s the case with a lot of people, which is why the books are so compelling.\u201d\nHe says the experience of reading the 3,600 pages aloud was like \u201ca big therapy session\u201d, and admits to dreaming about Knausgaard and incidents in the books.\nSarah Shrubb, an audio publisher at Little, Brown Book Group, says narrators often break down in tears reading aloud in the studio, especially when authors are reading their own work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult and you don\u2019t have the feedback of an audience. It\u2019s just you and the microphone creating these amazing soundscapes in your head. You have to play all of the characters and all their voices, and to be able to do them well is a real art form.\u201d\nShrubb says drama schools are beginning to take notice. \u201cIt is becoming an art form that is being taught in colleges. It is not just something actors do between jobs, it\u2019s a career.\u201d\nBallerini acknowledges that his view of the status of audiobooks is an unusual one. \u201cTo describe an audiobook as being the largest thing of someone\u2019s career is probably a new kind of claim,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is one that I stand by.\u201d",

        "content": "Brazil\u2019s new president will feel emboldened to roll back rainforest protections and legitimise police\u2019s use of deadly force\nIt was a softball question at a campaign trail press conference: what would Jair Bolsonaro do on his first day as president?\nBrazil\u2019s preeminent provocateur wrestled it straight into a Trumpian whirlpool of bluster and barminess.\nFirst, Bolsonaro \u2013 then still an outsider in the race for power \u2013 savaged Beijing. \u201cOpen your eyes, because the Chinese are buying Brazil!\u201d he warned the Guardian after the question during a trip to the Amazon last spring.\nThen, he pondered his own nation, declaring: \u201c[Brazil is like] a patient whose \u2026 whole body needs amputating.\u201d\nFinally, the far-right firebrand embarked on a jumbled three-minute rollick through issues including Brazilian politics (\u201can embarrassment!\u201d), the country itself (\u201ca load of rubbish!\u201d), English NGOs (\u201ca joke\u201d), Donald Trump (\u201cI\u2019m an admirer\u201d) and Israel (\u201cI\u2019ve been there \u2026 they raise fish in the desert!\u201d) before concluding his harangue with the six-word pledge that would define his insurgent campaign: \u201cWe are going to change Brazil!\u201d\nIt was vintage Bolsonaro: pugnacious, largely nonsensical and yet strangely engrossing \u2013 and perhaps a good guide to how the most unlikely president in Brazilian history will govern for the next four years.\nFew doubt the far-right populist \u2013 who took power on Tuesday \u2013 is serious about transforming the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy or that his presidency will be an unpredictable and ill-tempered affair.\nPerhaps no area faces a greater shake-up than the environment. To the horror of the environmentalists he so loathes, Bolsonaro has repeatedly signalled a desire to roll back environmental protections and make it easier to destroy the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. Deeds have accompanied those words.\nSince his stunning election, Bolsonaro has ditched plans to host key UN climate talks next year and appointed a foreign minister who believes climate change is a Marxist plot. As president, he looks set to take a sledgehammer to Brazil\u2019s hard-earned reputation as a global leader in the fight against climate change and herald a new era of wrecking in the Amazon.\nForeign policy will also be upended, as Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil seeks a snug and historic allegiance with Donald Trump\u2019s US and jettisons longstanding friendships with nations ruled by leftists, such as Cuba and Venezuela. \u201cEverything we can legally and democratically do against these countries, we will do,\u201d Bolsonaro recently vowed.\nBolsonaro\u2019s English-speaking son, Eduardo, appears poised to play a super-sized role in Brasilia\u2019s pivot to the White House, positioning himself as South American answer to Jared Kushner. Since his father\u2019s election, he has hobnobbed with Ted Cruz and Steve Bannon in the US and repeatedly assailed Venezuela\u2019s \u201cnarco-dictator\u201d president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nExpect regional tensions to soar in 2019 as Trump and the Bolsonaros gang up on the disintegrating Bolivarian revolution and Maduro responds in increasingly bellicose fashion.\nOn the domestic front, dramatic changes loom, too, as Bolsonaro \u2013 egged on by the powerful, ultra-conservative evangelists to whom he owes his election \u2013 strives to lead Brazil down a profoundly reactionary path. His decision to name Damares Alves, an anti-abortion evangelical preacher, as head of a new ministry overseeing Brazilian women, families, human rights and indigenous communities is a harbinger of the intolerance and conservatism ahead.\nThe mere prospect of a Bolsonaro presidency has already sent same-sex couples rushing to the altar for fear they might lose such rights once the proud homophobe takes power. With Bolsonaro in office, expect bigotry, hate crime \u2013 and resistance from Brazil\u2019s vibrant civil society \u2013 to increase.\nBrazil is already one of Latin America\u2019s most violent societies, suffering a record 63,880 homicides in 2017, but under Brazil\u2019s pro-gun president things are almost certain to get worse.\nBolsonaro campaigned as a law and order candidate, vowing to use brute force and bullets to slay the drug traffickers behind much of that violence. But he appears to have no real plan to reduce crime beyond fighting violence with violence, and he is almost certain to fail. Instead, by legitimising the police\u2019s use of deadly force, Bolsonaro\u2019s pro-repression rhetoric is likely to accelerate the already rampant killing.\nRio de Janeiro, whose newly elected, pro-Bolsonaro governor has called for helicopter-borne snipers to be used to execute rifle-carrying criminals \u2013 is likely to suffer particularly. More than 1,400 people were reportedly gunned down by Rio police in 2018 \u2013 a death every five-and-a-half hours. With Bolsonaro\u2019s blessing, the body count will rise.\nIn the final month before Tuesday\u2019s inauguration, Brazil\u2019s incoming president has hosted weekly Facebook Live broadcasts detailing his controversial and eccentric plans: a crackdown on immigrants who refuse to abandon their own culture and supposedly conspire to marry Brazilian children; a crusade against \u201cunproductive\u201d journalists and leftists who question him; doing away with indigenous reserves because he is convinced Brazil\u2019s tribespeople no longer wish to be stuck \u201cin the Stone Age\u201d.\n\u201cThe big day is arriving \u2013 1 January!\u201d Bolsonaro beamed in one recent webcast.\nIt is a date millions of progressive Brazilians have viewed with dread.",

It was not clear if Livni had been told of the move.\nThe now-defunct Zionist Union alliance, composed of Gabbay\u2019s Labour and Livni\u2019s Hatnuah parties, finished with the second highest number of seats in the last election in 2015.\nWith support from the more affluent districts around Tel Aviv and from liberal voters, the partnering had focused on unseating Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud, but failed.\nIt has since tumbled in opinion polls and Gabbay, who took over as leader in 2017, has had an uneasy relationship with Livni, a former foreign minister.\n\u201cI still believe in partnership, in connections, in uniting a large camp committed to change, but successful connections necessitate friendship, upholding agreements and commitment to a course,\u201d Gabbay told a meeting of Zionist Union parliament members. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in this partnership.\u201d\nLivni spoke tersely afterwards, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not responding. I will make my decisions. Thank you,\u201d before leaving the room. Apparently referring to earlier rumours of a potential spilt, she later tweeted that it was \u201cgood that the doubts had been dispelled\u201d.\nThe disbandment follows a separate major shake-up among the ruling coalition. On Saturday, two rightwing cabinet ministers, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, announced they were leaving their Jewish Home party to form a new one.\nPolls show Netanyahu, who leads what is seen as the most rightwing administration in Israel\u2019s history, is likely to win the 9 April polls. That would give him a fifth term in office and a good chance of succeeding the Jewish state\u2019s founder, David Ben-Gurion, as the longest-serving prime minister.\nDespite allegations of corruption, including police recommendations that he be indicted on charges of bribery and breach of trust in three separate cases, Netanyahu has held on to power through deals with ultra-nationalist secular and religious parties.\nLast month, however, he called early elections, initially set for November, after internal divisions in the ruling coalition curbed his government\u2019s ability to pass legislation. The prime minister, 69, now intends to form new alliances.\n\u201cI won\u2019t intervene in how the left divides its votes,\u201d he said in a statement after Gabbay\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to me is that the right forms the next government too, and continues to lead Israel.\u201d",

        "content": "Mayor uses New Year\u2019s Eve event to send message London remains open to Europeans\nIf the festive season can sometimes involve trolling relatives with different political views, Sadiq Khan has arguably taken the tradition to a grand scale with a New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display which has prompted apoplexy among Brexiters with its pro-EU message.\nThe mayor hailed the event, in which the London Eye was lit up in the blue-and-yellow colours of the EU flag, as part of a wider message to Europe that the capital would stay \u201copen-minded\u201d and \u201coutward looking\u201d after Brexit.\nAs the fireworks went off along the Thames, the words \u201cLondon is open\u201d were said in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Spanish just after midnight.\nThe phrase is often used by the Labour mayor, who opposes Brexit and has called for a second referendum. The event also featured musical performances by European artists.\n\u201cWe, in my opinion, are one of the greatest cities in the world; one of the reasons we are one of the greatest cities in the world is because of the contribution made by Europeans,\u201d Khan said before the display. \u201cI think diversity is a strength and I think what tonight is about is celebrating that diversity.\n\u201cI hope that members of parliament, members of the government will see the fireworks tonight, will listen to the soundtrack and will reflect on what sort of country they want to live in post-March.\u201d\nHe said the display was about \u201cshowing the world, while they\u2019re watching us, that we\u2019re going to carry on being open-minded, outward looking, pluralistic\u201d.\nIn a tweet afterwards, the mayor said: \u201cOur 1 million EU citizens are Londoners, they make a huge contribution, and no matter the outcome of Brexit, they will always be welcome.\u201d\nWhile the sentiment might be popular with many Londoners, given the capital voted strongly in favour of staying in the EU, the display brought condemnation from the more militant Brexiters.\nAndrew Bridgen, a Conservative MP with an occasional sideline in Brexit-based hyperbole, said the message had been \u201ca betrayal of democracy\u201d, telling the Sun: \u201cIt\u2019s low, it\u2019s very low to politicise what is an international public event.\u201d\nRoger Helmer, a former Conservative MEP who defected to Ukip, tweeted: \u201cWhile the UK is locked in critical negotiations with Brussels, Sadiq Khan chooses to display the other side\u2019s flag on the London Eye. Would he have shown an Argentinian flag during the Falklands war?\u201d\nThe anti-Brexit message is in keeping with Khan\u2019s wider views on Brexit, where his public expressions are notably different from the pledges to respect the verdict of the 2016 referendum made regularly by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\nKhan, who took over the mayoralty from Boris Johnson and plans to stand for another four-year term in 2020, has argued for a special Brexit deal for London, to protect both the contribution of its high population of EU nationals, and the financial institutions of the City.\nIn September, Khan said the time wasted by Theresa May and the risk posed by a no-deal Brexit meant he was supporting a second referendum, which should include the option of staying in the EU.\nThe mayor has previously annoyed political opponents with symbolic gestures, most notably his decision to allow protesters against the visit of Donald Trump in July to fly a \u201cTrump baby\u201d balloon mocking the US president, with whom he has previously clashed over Trump\u2019s response to terror attacks in London.\nA large-scale fireworks display on the Thames has gradually become a regular part of London\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations since one was organised for the millennium celebrations.\nThe 2018 display, involving eight tonnes of fireworks, was paid for by \u00a32.3m in funding from the Greater London authority, offset by revenue from 100,000 ticket sales.",

New album A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships teems with ideas from cool jazz to glitchy electronica, brash 80s pop to Drake-ish Auto-Tune, house music to the kind of ballads designed to raise the roof at venues like these.Tour begins 9 January, SSE Arena, Belfast\nThe line up of this year\u2019s Celtic Connections festival is impressively eclectic \u2013 everyone from traditional folk acts to Stereolab\u2019s Laetitia Sadier to Graham Nash. World music is strongly represented too: a collaboration between Senegalese kora player Seckou Keita and harpist Catrin Finch, Portugese fado singer Mariza, Malian ngoni virtuoso Bassekou Kouyate and Basque accordionist Kepa Junkera.Various venues, Glasgow, 17 January to 3 February\nCanada\u2019s Fucked Up have spent years exploring the parameters of punk rock to vast acclaim. Their last album, Dose Your Dreams, was an 18-track conceptual work that returned to the character of David, from 2011\u2019s similarly sprawling David Comes to Life, and took in everything from prog rock and psychedelia to industrial music and disco. Cerebral, inventive and unpredictable on record, they\u2019re reliably ferocious live.Tour begins 20 January, Ruby Lounge, Manchester\nAzealia Banks is such a constant, controversy-generating presence on social media (and apparently she is launching her own social media platform, called Cheapy XO) that it\u2019s easy for her abilities as a rapper to get overlooked. Whatever you make of her trolling on Twitter, her music has been sporadically fantastic, and the sense that anything could happen when she performs live adds a certain piquancy.Tour begins 24 January, O2 Ritz, Manchester\nFrontman Ben Gibbard and his hardy US indie perennials return to the UK in the wake of their ninth album, Thank You for Today, a more autumnal, fortysomething take on their trademark melancholy sound. New ground remains unbroken, but Death Cab are the stuff of which undying, rabid cult followings are made of, and a certain familiarity is part of the appeal.Tour begins 25 January, Albert Hall, Manchester\nMassive Attack\u2019s third album may well have been dance music\u2019s answer to Radiohead\u2019s OK Computer. Both seemed out of step with the mood of the times: islands of bleak paranoia and darkness amid of a sea of perky Britpop, and beatifically stoned (and indeed Massive Attack-inspired) trip-hop, respectively. Twenty-one years on, the band take it on tour, apparently reimagined \u201cusing custom audio reconstructed from the original samples and influences\u201d. The question of whether the \u201cspecial guests\u201d will include elusive vocalist Liz Fraser looms large.Tour begins 28 January, SSE Arena, Glasgow\nThere is something deeply improbable about a band releasing their masterpiece 25 years into their career, but that was what Low did with 2018\u2019s Double Negative, a claustrophobic, experimental and brilliant examination of life in Trump\u2019s America that pushed at the boundaries of their long-established \u201cslowcore\u201d sound. It is not the easiest listen but it is an exceptionally moving and rewarding one, evidence of a rare artistic fearlessness.Tour begins 29 January, Tramway, Glasgow\nA profoundly unlikely turn of events: 11 years after they reconvened without leader and chief songwriter Jerry Dammers, the Specials release a new album. In the intervening period, drummer John Bradbury has died, guitarist Roddy Byers and vocalist Neville Staple have left. How the remaining trio \u2013 vocalist Terry Hall, guitarist Lynval Golding and bassist Horace Panter \u2013 will fare without them is an intriguing question, although early reports are promising.Released 1 February\nThe videos Jimothy Lacoste has uploaded to YouTube have become something of a talking point in recent months: are his optimistic lyrics, guileless rapping style and exuberant dancing for real, or one of those impenetrable millennial gags where irony is piled on irony? He insists it\u2019s the former; whatever the answer, there is something undeniably charming and catchy about his music.Tour begins 6 February, King Tut\u2019s Wah Wah Hut, Glasgow\nExpectations are high for the debut album by the rapper formerly known as Looney. Last year, his self-released single Butterflies made the Top 20, and its dancefloor inflections provide a clue to his eponymously titled album\u2019s sound. Keen for his brand of grime to reflect his Trinidadian roots, he has said the album also features a soca influence and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, tracks inspired by country and western.Released 8 February\nA rare UK tour from a genuine soul legend \u2013 both as part of Motown\u2019s world-beating Holland-Dozier-Holland writing team and as a solo artist whose 70s oeuvre, not least the oft-covered Going Back to My Roots, should not be overshadowed by the songs he wrote for others. The tour promises \u201creimagined\u201d versions of his umpteen hits in an intimate, \u201cunplugged\u201d format, interspersed with Dozier telling the stories behind the songs.Tour begins 13 February, Old Market, Hove\nShould you ever wonder about precisely how much power critics exert over public taste, consider the case of Post Malone, the face-tattoo-bedecked Texan rapper. Released to a widespread yell of horror from reviewers, his second album, Beerbongs and Bentleys, went on to break streaming records on Spotify and reached No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, making this forthcoming arena tour look not unlike a victory lap.Tour begins 14 February, 3Arena, Dublin\nAs pop stars who rose to fame on television talent shows go, Troye Sivan cuts a pleasingly irregular figure. His second album, Bloom, put his queerness front and centre, quoted Smiths lyrics, featured songs about Grindr and losing one\u2019s virginity as a bottom, and was noticeably influenced by ethereal gothic collective This Mortal Coil. The world could use more pop stars like him.Tour begins 23 February, O2 Academy, Glasgow\nTrench, the darker, more intense 2018 follow-up to Twenty One Pilots\u2019 multi-platinum breakthrough album Blurryface \u2013 home to ubiquitous millennial moping anthem Stressed Out \u2013 attracted surprisingly strong reviews. The inevitable subsequent arena tour reaches Britain this year: apparently their live show tends towards the spectacular and comes packed with stunts, including something called \u201cvertical crowd surfing\u201d.Tour begins 27 February, Genting Arena, Birmingham\nWeezer frontman Rivers Cuomo has been talking about the US alt-rock quartet\u2019s 12th studio album since before their 11th studio album came out. Intended as a darker counterpart to 2016\u2019s Weezer (The White Album), it was briefly put on hold in favour of the electronically inclined Pacific Daydream. It will be seeing the light of day in March, produced by Dave Sitek and apparently sounding like \u201cthe Beach Boys gone bad\u201d.Released 1 March\nThese are not the best of times for what would once have been called indie rock, but Brighton based Our Girl \u2013 another project from Soph Nathan of the Mercury-nominated Big Moon \u2013 bucked the trend with Stranger Today, an atmospheric, potent album packed with great songs recalling the kind of thing 4AD would have released in the late 80s. You can catch glimpses of Pixies and shoegazing about their sound, but there\u2019s a uniqueness and character to it that transcends their influences.Tour begins 4 March, Jacaranda Records Phase One, Liverpool\nIt\u2019s perhaps unfair to lay a resurgence of mainstream interest in jazz at the door of one artist, but there is no doubting the impact of Kamasi Washington\u2019s two sprawling albums, The Epic and Heaven and Earth, and his collaborations with Kendrick Lamar and Run the Jewels. The proof that he draws in a far wider audience than usual without compromising his sound or ambition is that he\u2019s playing a venue the size of Brixton Academy.Brixton Academy, London, 5 March\nOf all the fresh-faced, gravel-voiced, acoustic-guitar-toting singer-songwriters who emerged in Ed Sheeran\u2019s wake, George Ezra, perhaps unexpectedly, has proved the most successful. His second album, Staying at Tamara\u2019s, spawned last summer\u2019s most ubiquitous single, Shotgun, and sold half a million copies \u2013 evidence of his ability to unite a section of the market that would once have been called teenyboppers with a more mature, Radio 2-friendly audience. So the crowd at these gigs should be intriguing.Tour begins 7 March, Metro Radio Arena, Newcastle\nA one-off date from Larry Cummings Kiala, yet another east London rapper who has stormed the charts without the aid of a record label. His career kicked off with a dancehall remake of Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You; his sound juggles trap and drill, afro swing and bashment; the screams from the crowd evident at his 2018 gigs suggest pin-up status is upon him. This London show will be his biggest British solo gig to date.Brixton Academy, London, 15 March\nNao\u2019s second album, Saturn, was among 2018\u2019s most charming. Less synth-based than her debut, beautifully poised between mainstream R&B, funk, heartstring-tugging ballads and something more psychedelic and leftfield, it avoided the obvious in favour of forging a gently eccentric individual path.Tour begins 20 March, Albert Hall, Manchester\nOf all the artists to emerge from the sprawling Odd Future collective, the Internet are, by some distance, the most musically intriguing. While Tyler, the Creator is still capable of grabbing the headlines through his lyrics, Syd and Matt Martian\u2019s band have taken a less controversial route, releasing a string of hugely inventive and futuristic funk/soul albums: last year\u2019s Hive Mind was typically great.Tour begins 21 March, Brixton Academy, London\nIdles\u2019 second album, Joy As An Act of Resistance, made a big enough impact to warrant some writers dubbing them \u201cthe most important band in Britain\u201d. Certainly, their arty, jagged take on punk carries a ferocious power, while Joe Talbot\u2019s lyrics hold up a mirror to contemporary Britain with slashing wit and a real tenderness. But they\u2019re a band who are really best experienced live in all their chaotic, tumultuous glory.Tour begins 26 March, Leadmill, Sheffield\nJulia Jacklin\u2019s 2016 album Don\u2019t Let the Kids Win was a minor masterpiece of off-kilter singer-songwriter quirkiness, its idiosyncrasies charming rather than irritating: witty songs about drugged-out boyfriends and wishing Zach Braff and Catherine Deneuve were her parents, with a country-ish lilt to the music. The forthcoming follow-up, Crushing, promises a \u201crejection of expectations\u201d \u2013 starker, more personal, fewer laughs \u2013 but the single Body was still spine-tingling, and a handful of UK dates last November sold out.Tour begins 26 March, Haunt, Brighton\nRay BLK won the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2017 poll, the first unsigned artist to do so. As perhaps should have been expected from an artist whose debut release was an EP based on Miss Havisham from Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations, the path she has followed since has been intriguingly serpentine, some distance from the standard pop-R&B approach. Last year\u2019s Empress, an eight-track project that featured Stormzy, offered ample evidence of her talent.Kentish Town Forum, London, 28 March\nThis sounds compellingly bizarre: the 78-year-old electronic pioneer heads out on his first tour, in which he will \u201cconduct, play the vocoder, electronic effects and sounds, play the piano\u201d and \u201cshare personal stories that have never left the walls of his studio before\u201d. Titled A Celebration of the 80s, it will also feature a tribute to his most famous collaborator, Donna Summer.Tour begins 1 April, Birmingham Symphony Hall\nStefflon Don is one of the few British MCs who appear to be making headway in the US, thanks partly to her collaborations with Demi Lovato, Future and French Montana, and partly, one suspects, because her flow is less obviously London-accented than her grime peers. She is the first UK artist ever to be included in hip-hop magazine XXL\u2019s prestigious Freshman Class guide to future stars. Her live performances, too, are more spectacular and pop-facing than her grimier peers.Tour begins 13 April, Stylus, Leeds",

        "content": "Back with a bold fourth album, Ellie Goulding is set on a new sound, averting environmental catastrophe \u2013 and settling a score or two\nThanks to her stadium-husky voice, deployed on expansive pop full of unabashed emotion, Ellie Goulding has long been one of the UK\u2019s biggest global pop stars. In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the Guardian, is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities.\nWhere has your head been at since the last album?\n  I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn\u2019t really have the same rock\u2019n\u2019roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I\u2019d often book studios and there\u2019d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn\u2019t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.\nAnd you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn\u2019t want to overanalyse what I had with him \u2013 it\u2019s something much more pure, and something I didn\u2019t need to explain to myself in a song.\nBut on one new song, Love I\u2019m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I\u2019d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don\u2019t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere \u2013 I\u2019d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don\u2019t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I\u2019m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again.\nWhat else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with \u2013 I\u2019m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can\u2019t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I\u2019d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn\u2019t feel the need to be angry \u2013 so maybe that\u2019s a good thing.\nAre you talking about Ed Sheeran? [Don\u2019t is widely believed to be about Goulding.]Er \u2026 not specifically. [Sighs] There was a period where I felt someone was trying to sabotage me. So there probably are small pieces of the songs that relate to things that frustrate me, and things that are happening in the world, but I\u2019ve always been conscious that I want to keep songwriting as an escape.\nThere\u2019s a bit of a pop-rap feel to some of the new tracks \u2013 were you trying to do something new?I think it\u2019s important to know the way pop is changing \u2013 I would never release something completely blind, without listening to any radio or Spotify, and expect people to like it; and for it to compare with what\u2019s out there. But I still find it thrilling when people release something that doesn\u2019t sound like anything else \u2013 I\u2019m always fighting to work with producers coming up with whole new soundscapes. My voice doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s in the world, so I\u2019ve got that to my advantage, and I can also manipulate my voice as part of the track or make it into a sample. That\u2019s how I stay not sounding like anything else \u2013 I have that locked, for ever.Does pop ever feel frivolous compared with your climate change activism?\n  Sometimes it does. But often I really need to just write a bloody good pop song after meeting climate scientists, or going to the climate assembly in Kenya last year. Going to Greenland and seeing glaciers collapse. It\u2019s gone beyond facts and boring data \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it with our own eyes. The wildfires [in California] were exacerbated by climate change, the crazy storms that have been happening: it\u2019s very obvious.\nOne of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active; we need to compensate for what\u2019s going on in certain political situations. I know that \u201ccelebrities shouldn\u2019t get involved in politics\u201d, but it\u2019s something we have to act on now. I can\u2019t help but feel a bit frustrated that I\u2019m the only one speaking out about something so important \u2013 no one else in my peer group is.\nThe next step is electing people who take this seriously, and to trust scientists. And having a bigger consciousness of your day-to-day actions. I don\u2019t eat that much meat; I try to use sustainable fashion brands; we\u2019re trying to make my tour completely plastic free, and cut down on flights, with a better eco-bus situation. I think I\u2019m probably doing more good than bad, overall.",

The baby was saved by being in a cradle and warmly wrapped up,\u201d the Chelyabinsk region\u2019s governor, Boris Dubrovsky, said.\nThe infant was pulled carefully from the wreckage and driven to hospital.\nThe health ministry said in a statement that the child was in a dangerous condition with serious frostbite, a head injury and leg fractures. He was due to be taken to Moscow for treatment.\nThe recovery \u2013 about 35 hours after the block collapsed \u2013 provided some hope for rescuers, even as the search for other survivors looked increasingly futile.\nAt least seven people were killed and 37 more remain missing after the explosion tore through the residential building in central Russia, leaving hundreds without a home on New Year\u2019s Eve. Only six survivors have been found, including a 13-year-old boy.\nA large section of the 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, in the Ural mountains, crumbled at about 6am local time on Monday, when many people were still asleep.\nPowerful heaters were deployed in the hope of stopping any trapped survivors from freezing to death. Workers had scoured the crushed concrete and mangled steel throughout the night but the search was temporarily halted out of fear other sections of the structure could be unstable.\nOn Tuesday, the head of Russia\u2019s emergencies ministry, Yevgeny Zinichev, said there was a \u201creal threat of part of the building collapsing \u2026 It\u2019s impossible to continue working in such conditions.\u201d Efforts to stabilise the walls could take up to 24 hours.\nThe Soviet-era apartment block was home to about 1,100 people, and other residents had been evacuated to a nearby school. The blast completely destroyed 35 flats but others were left standing.\nVolunteers have offered money and clothing for victims, and some said they were ready to provide temporary shelter to those in need. Magnitogorsk, about 1,000 miles (1,600km) east of Moscow, is home to one of the country\u2019s largest steel producers.\nStaff from Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works took part in the rescue operation and the company\u2019s chairman said it would provide financial assistance.\nDubrovsky announced a day of mourning on 2 January, with flags lowered and celebrations cancelled, after the disaster dampened spirits during the new year period, usually the country\u2019s biggest annual festivity.\nVladimir Putin rushed to the scene on Monday, with television broadcasts showing him looking concerned as he met local officials.\n\u201cIt is in the character of our people, despite new year\u2019s festivities, to remember to think of the dead and wounded at this moment,\u201d the president said.\nWitnesses said the explosion was strong enough to shatter the windows of nearby buildings. \u201cI woke up and felt myself falling. The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried,\u201d said one resident.\nInvestigators have opened a criminal inquiry into the explosion.",

        "content": "Both opposition and ruling coalition claim victory after chaotic presidential poll\nFears of electoral fraud are rising in the Democratic Republic of the Congo after officials said a total block on internet connections and SMS services imposed after the chaotic presidential poll on Sunday could last for several days.\nBoth the opposition and ruling coalition have claimed victory in the elections \u2013 the third poll since 2002 and the end of a civil war in which millions died.\nThe election, which some observers hope may bring a measure of political stability to the vast central African country, was marred by widespread logistics problems, insecurity and an outbreak of Ebola. Millions were left unable to vote.\nBarnab\u00e9 Kikaya Bin Karubi, a senior adviser to the outgoing president, Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS services were cut on Monday to preserve public order after \u201cfictitious results\u201d began circulating on social media. \u201cThat could lead us straight toward chaos,\u201d Kikaya told Reuters, adding that the connections would remain cut until the publication of preliminary results on 6 January.\nThe signal to Radio France Internationale (RFI), one of the most popular news sources in the DRC, was also down, and the government withdrew the accreditation of RFI\u2019s main DRC correspondent late on Monday for having aired unofficial results from the opposition.\nOpposition activists said they believed the internet had been cut off to prevent people circulating information that could allow the official count to be challenged when it is announced.\n\u201cIt is very straightforward. They don\u2019t want us to compile our own totals of votes,\u201d said one Kinshasa resident who requested anonymity.\nOlivier Kamitatu, a spokesperson for opposition candidates, said the media crackdown was part of a \u201cplan to obscure the truth of the ballot box\u201d.\nThe measures drew a sharp response from several western powers. In a statement supported by the UK and France, the EU and the US called on authorities to restore the internet and to allow the country\u2019s two main election monitors \u2013 the National Episcopal Conference of Congo (CENCO) and Symocel, an alliance of citizens\u2019 observer missions \u2013 access to the count.\nThe election, which passed off mostly peacefully, could bring about the central African country\u2019s first ostensibly democratic transition of power in its troubled history and chart a road to a better future. Others fear renewed instability if the opposition rejects the results and calls for protests.\nAlready delayed by two years, the poll was postponed by a further week to allow more time to overcome logistical challenges in a country of 80 million inhabitants spread over an area the size of western Europe with almost no metalled roads.\nKabila\u2019s second electoral mandate expired in 2016 and he only reluctantly called new elections under pressure from regional powers. The constitution forbade him from standing again and critics claim he hopes now to rule through the handpicked government candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.\nThe president congratulated \u201cthe Congolese people\u201d for having \u201caccomplished their civic duty in peace and dignity\u201d in a new year address broadcast on national television on Tuesday. \u201cThere can be no doubt. The DRC is not only a republic but \u2026 a democracy too,\u201d he said.\nBut analysts have long said the period after the elections would be more dangerous to the long-term stability of the DRC than the polls themselves. Opposition parties have pledged to oppose any result they see as fraudulent, promising to paralyse the country with a campaign of protests.\n\u201cIf the results during the publication of the presidential results don\u2019t reflect the truth \u2026 trouble will break out across the city,\u201d said Fabrice Shweka, a resident of the eastern city of Goma.\nIn the poll on Sunday, Shadary, a hardline interior minister under EU sanctions for his role in a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy activists last year, faced off against two main opposition challengers, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu.\nA survey shortly before the vote put Fayulu, a former business executive, ahead by more than 20 points. Shadary came in third on 19%. In a statement late on Monday, Fayulu complained about irregularities but said he was encouraged by the determination of Congolese people to vote despite long queues and voting machines that broke down.\n\u201cI call for vigilance across the board and the general mobilisation of all Congolese so that the truth of the ballot box, the sole witness to the will of the Congolese people, can reward their efforts and sacrifices,\u201d he said.\nMembers of Fayulu\u2019s campaign team have accused the government of ordering the shutdown to avoid broadcasting his \u201coverwhelming victory\u201d.\nThe DRC refused international offers of help to conduct the elections, claiming it would compromise its sovereignty.\nHundreds of polling places opened hours late because they did not have the needed lists of registered voters. Many voters could not find their names on the lists and there were problems with more than 500 of the electronic voting machines.\nMany polls stayed open into the night to allow those waiting in line to cast ballots. At least one Kinshasa polling station did not open until after the official closing time.\nThe government\u2019s last-minute decision to bar an estimated 1 million people in two opposition-stronghold cities from voting on Sunday, citing the deadly Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the country, prompted protests.\nThe DRC suffers from widespread corruption, continuing conflict, endemic disease, and some of the world\u2019s highest levels of sexual violence and malnutrition. It is also rich in minerals, including those crucial to the world\u2019s smartphones and electric cars.\nThe country has not known a peaceful transfer of power since winning independence from Belgium in 1960.",

        "content": "We are trying to be positive, but there\u2019s little likely to put a smile on your face \u2013 except for a couple of things \u2026\nMaking predictions in the world of business and economics is a fool\u2019s errand but that\u2019s no reason not to have a crack at it. Here are some things to look out for in 2019, which could be a rollercoaster ride.\nHow about global recession, a US-China trade war and a chaotic Brexit for starters? Any or all of these could cast a shadow over people and businesses the world over.\nThe greatest unknown for British business and the economy lies in the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The automotive industry has warned that production lines could be halted and investment choked off, while Airbus said it would be forced to cut jobs and pull billions of pounds in UK spending. Between them, carmakers and the European aerospace giant support around 1m jobs. That\u2019s before one begins to assess the impact on industries such as pharmaceuticals, aviation, food and drink or London\u2019s financial sector.\nThen there\u2019s the prospect that the early skirmishes of a Sino-US trade war turn into full-blown hostility. There\u2019s no telling what Donald Trump will do or say next so any optimism that the spectre of mutually assured destruction will bring everyone back from the brink seems naive.\nTrade wars, coupled with higher interest rates in major economies such as the US, could place greater drag on a global economy that already seems to be cooling, particularly in Europe and Asia. However, respected economist Nouriel Roubini has said a crash won\u2019t come until 2020. You\u2019ve got to take your crumbs of comfort where you can.\nEver since the outsourcing and construction firm\u2019s ignominious collapse a year ago, pundits and short-sellers have been placing bets on who will be next. The two companies mentioned most often in the same breath as Carillion are Kier and Interserve. Both insist they have taken pre-emptive steps to avoid a similar fate. But there were some concerning words in Kier\u2019s explanation for having to go cap in hand to shareholders for \u00a3250m. It warned that banks were pulling back from lending to the construction industry \u2013 words that will have sent shivers down the spine of anyone who remembers the last financial crisis.\nCuadrilla became the first company to frack for gas since 2011 this year, drilling near Blackpool, Lancashire. Rivals are set to follow suit, with iGas probably the most likely to get fracking in 2019 and petrochemicals giant Ineos also champing at the bit. If Cuadrilla\u2019s experience is anything to go by though, this could mean minor earthquakes in and around the areas where hydraulic fracturing \u2013 to give it its full name \u2013 takes place. If tremors become commonplace, 2019 could well be the year in which fracking becomes politically unpalatable in the UK for the foreseeable future.\nEver since Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, he\u2019s been at war with them. The year 2018 involved disruptive strike action by pilots and cabin crew, leading to flight cancellations. Ryanair has made some concessions on pay and conditions but O\u2019Leary isn\u2019t the sort of man to let anyone else have the last word, branding his pilots \u201ca bunch of layabouts\u201d in December. How long can labour relations remain this poor before something has to give? Could 2019 be the year that O\u2019Leary steps down?\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how conditions on the high street could get much worse. Failures in 2018 included Maplin\u2019s, Toys R Us, House of Fraser and Poundworld. Now Debenhams is in a difficult position.\nWhat\u2019s the problem?\nPhysical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as the coronavirus pandemic. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.\nIn terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u00a0\nAt the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit and the coronavirus, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.\nWhat help do retailers need?\nRetailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers. Many businesses which deal with complex supply chains also want additional help with the new red tape and import charges imposed after Boris Johnson's Brexit deal saddled them with extra costs.\nWhat is the government doing?\nIn the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.\nBrexit contingency plans, including stockpiling of goods, are already costing retailers money. Consumers are reining in spending. Weakness in the housing market means homewares may continue to suffer, while fashion sales remain in the doldrums. The government has offered little sign of relief on punishing business rates, while the threat posed to traditional stores by lightly taxed online giants is unlikely to abate.\nPredictions for 2019 have offered precious few reasons to giggle uncontrollably so far but here\u2019s one. The liberalisation of cannabis laws in North America presents huge opportunities for big business. Marlboro cigarette company Altria has agreed to invest $1.9bn in cannabis firm Cronos, while Budweiser owner AB InBev is working with Canadian pot firm Tilray on a $100m research deal into non-alcoholic drinks containing the active ingredients of cannabis, THC and CBD.\nHowever, you look at it, 2018 has been a high point (apologies) for the cannabis industry. Marijuana smokers are legion and the US market is gigantic. Expect interest and investment to surge in 2019.\nLegal battles lie ahead for former Barclays\u2019 executives and Lloyds, raising the mouth-watering prospect of finding out which is the tougher opponent for the might of the financial sector, the Serious Fraud Office or television presenter Noel Edmonds.\nThe SFO is set to begin its case against bankers including former Barclays chief executive John Varley over the bank\u2019s fundraising deals in the Middle East at the height of the credit crunch.\nMeanwhile, Edmonds\u2019 \u00a360m suit against Lloyds for alleged fraud at HBOS is set to continue, with the TV star preparing to file his legal claim.",

        "content": "The streaming pioneer is facing competition from content suppliers, not to mention Apple and Amazon\nThe streaming pioneer Netflix\u2019s first mover advantage has taken it to nearly 150m global subscribers \u2013 but serious competition is now coming as traditional media companies and Silicon Valley rivals fight back.\nDisney, with the might of its super franchises from Marvel to Pixar and Star Wars, is set to join the fray with its own streaming service, Disney+. The world\u2019s largest entertainment group is banking on its content clout to help make its relatively late entry into the market a success.\nThe AT&T-owned WarnerMedia is also prepping a service that will include content from HBO, Turner and the Warner Bros film studio. WarnerMedia has not been as combative as Disney in pulling content from Netflix. But Netflix\u2019s willingness to pay $100m (\u00a378m) to keep Friends for one more year \u2013 at which point WarnerMedia will have to decide whether to keep it exclusively for its own service \u2013 highlights the value of crowd-pulling content and the problems Netflix could face if media companies reassess their content strategies. Netflix previously paid $30m a year for Friends, which has proven one of its biggest hits globally.\n\u201cNetflix is facing increased competition from some of its previous content suppliers,\u201d said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere Analysis. \u201cDespite its major focus on original content the company is still hugely reliant on licensed content for subscribers and that carries risks.\u201d\nAmpere estimates that Netflix original productions in the US make up only about 8% of the hours of content available in its vast library, and 9% in the UK. A further 5% of hours is labelled as original by Netflix because it airs it first, but is actually acquired from content suppliers, such as Star Trek: Discovery.\n\u201cIndividually any one of the big Hollywood studio groups does not make up a huge proportion of Netflix\u2019s catalogue, maybe 4% or 5% of total hours,\u201d says Broughton. \u201cIf one or two pull their content Netflix can plug the gap. But if the market gets more aggressive against Netflix, it is going to get tougher.\u201d\nNetflix is already facing off against Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, a global rival with ambitious plans including a Lord of the Rings extravaganza. A rattled Netflix upped its content budget by 50%, from $8bn to $12bn, when Amazon announced it would spend $5bn this year. But Amazon could easily outspend rivals: its market value is six times bigger than Netflix and 4.5 times the size of Disney.\nNetflix will also be looking over its shoulder at Apple, which is widely expected to launch a global streaming service this year.\nThe content arms race is costing Netflix dear. The company expects a negative free cash flow of $3bn-$4bn this year \u2013 meaning the amount it spends on content, marketing and other costs in 2018 will exceed what it earns from subscribers by at least $3bn. Netflix keeps turning to debt markets to top up the funds it needs to continue to feed film and TV content to the binge-watching generation it helped create \u2013 its net debt was $8.34bn at the end of September, up over 70% year-on-year.\nNetflix built its reputation and audiences from expensive dramas, such as The Crown. It has recently started to focus on cheaper, yet popular, unscripted shows \u2013 snapping up the Channel 4 reality show The Circle to make it in multiple markets \u2013 with the Netflix CEO Reed Hastings highlighting the value of such fare.\n\u201cUnscripted television has always been a hugely profitable sector,\u201d says Lucas Green, head of content at Banijay Group, maker of shows including Survivor, Temptation Island and Wife Swap. \u201cDrama has always got the headlines and red carpet treatment. Yet gameshows, quiz, reality TV, dating, baking and talent shows are highly returnable, faster to produce, more cost efficient and therefore lower risk. \u201d\nNetflix is also facing pressure outside the US, which is increasingly nearing peak Netflix, for the next cycle of growth. Well over 80% of the new subscribers added by Netflix in the third quarter came from outside the US.\nThe company has been very bullish on the prospects of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly India. But Netflix\u2019s pricing makes it a premium service compared with pay-TV and streaming rivals in many of these new markets and it may have to cut prices \u2013 meaning it will need more subscribers.\nWhich rival will be the biggest threat to Netflix? Broughton reckons it is Amazon: \u201cIf I had to put my money somewhere it would have to be on Amazon. New players like Disney and WarnerMedia will need a lot of time and marketing to break into households, and who else will want to licence content to them? Amazon has the deepest pockets. Its catalogue is by far the largest, even if a lot of the content is quite old, and it has been exploring sports rights and other areas other players aren\u2019t. \u201d",

        "content": "Having wobbled and tumbled over a challenging Christmas week, Arsenal got back on the bike on Tuesday. They did so a little gingerly but ended an afternoon freewheeling past Fulham feeling buoyed by the restorative power of points and goals.\nLast week\u2019s slips at Brighton and, more punishingly, Liverpool came as a large dollop of reality for a club whose path to a new post-Wenger way was always likely to be a bumpy one. A reaction was needed \u2013 both from Unai Emery and from his players.\nThe Premier League\u2019s original Tinkerman, Claudio Ranieri, knows all about the benefits and perils of high-intensity squad juggling and it will not have gone unnoticed how Emery has attacked this project with a penchant for impatiently shuffling his pack before and during games. The search for his most balanced side is an ongoing one, not helped by the vulnerabilities in defence that are so hard to cure with relentless injuries in that department.\nBut for all the angst about Arsenal\u2019s goals conceded column, goal creation and execution also needed attention, having dipped of late. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette were granted a rare start side by side (something they experienced only once in 10 games before this fixture). It is one of Arsenal\u2019s enduring curiosities that both Emery and his predecessor showed reluctance to play their two strongest attackers as a pair. Both had opportunities. Both got on the scoresheet. For all that it might feel risky for Arsenal to start two strikers, it does seem riskier not to.\nEmery pondered it afterwards and touched upon the big balance question. That was something Ranieri also had in his mind. Fulham brought a sense of adventure, even if marrying that to defensive stability was not easy. They carved out two fantastic chances for the speedy Ryan Sessegnon in the first half. Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s hulking presence was another menace as defenders bounced off him and Bernd Leno had to be alert to keep out a couple of his headers.\nJust as Arsenal were feeling the pressure they pulled themselves together to score. Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi combined all afternoon and when the ball was floated in Granit Xhaka was unmarked with enough time to chest the ball down and pass it into the net.\nArsenal chances came regularly and they got a cushion early in the second half. Iwobi was involved, creating the space for a spate of quickfire passing involving Aubameyang and Kolasinac, and Lacazette was on hand to smash the ball in.\nLacazette was disappointed not to be awarded a penalty when Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri caught him with an outstretched leg as he burst forwards in the box. Nothing was given by the referee, Graham Scott. Seri was instrumental in Fulham cutting the deficit moments later. He bundled over Lucas Torreira and advanced to play a key role in the move that ended with Sessegnon crossing for the substitute Aboubakar Kamara to tap in.\nThe Fulham bench was all smiles this time after the weekend penalty brouhaha. \u201cI have no grudge,\u201d Ranieri explained. \u201cHe apologised immediately to me, his teammates, the club and it is finished there. I need all my players. I kill but after I give oxygen to them.\u201d\nThe mood lurched. Briefly Fulham attacked at will and Arsenal\u2019s anxiety gnawed. The air of discontent took a notable turn as the substitution of Lacazette for Aaron Ramsey was greeted by boos \u2013 the first time Arsenal supporters aired an audible challenge to Emery. \u201cYou need a cold mind to make a decision,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery supporter can have a different opinion but I need to do my work.\u201d It was not such a bad change after all, as the Welshman eased some nerves by scoring Arsenal\u2019s third on the rebound after Aubameyang struck a post.\nIt looked like one of those days for Arsenal\u2019s top scorer, who went close a handful of times, but his goal came eventually, albeit aided by a deflection. He went over to the bench to celebrate with Lacazette. The Arsenal hierarchy, and where certain players fit into it, remains an intriguing conundrum in the Emery era. Again Mesut \u00d6zil was absent and the Ramsey situation \u2013 with his contract running down while he continues to contribute \u2013 adds to the complicated strands that need tidying up.\nDefensive imrprovement is Emery\u2019s priority. \u201cToday was the first time we could play with Sokratis [Papastathopoulos], [Shkodran] Mustafi and [Laurent] Koscielny,\u201d he said. \u201cThen came an injury from Mustafi in the first half so we changed to a back four. We are very happy with the attacking players. We need defence also to take more balance and improve. We need to work. We need to prepare for to do better for the second half of the season.\u201d\nThe prospect of any arrivals to bolster that department is difficult but open. \u201cThe club is working, watching different possibilities,\u201d Emery said. \u201cMaybe we can if the transfer market gives an opportunity to sign one or two players.\u201d\nRanieri is also on the hunt for reinforcements and refinement. \u201cMy defence improved a lot but, when you play against these type of players that are fast, skilled, that is where you have to improve more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be faster. If there will be an opportunity for us I am sure our chairman will help us to stay in the Premier League.\u201d",

Mental health chiefs and staff groups are worried that staffing problems will undermine those ambitions.\nIn July 2017 the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the recruitment of 21,000 extra personnel including psychiatrists, mental health nurses and therapists would help the NHS treat 1 million more people with mental health problems by 2020-21 and provide 24/7 care.\nNHS Digital figures show that in August 2017 mental health trusts employed 179,333 staff. That had risen to 180,858 by August last year.\nBarbara Keeley, the shadow mental health minister, who highlighted the statistics, said: \u201cThis government\u2019s failure to act on the mental health workforce crisis could threaten to turn the burning injustice of mental ill-health that the prime minister pledged to tackle into a raging inferno.\u201d\nThe disclosure of the modest increase comes days before the publication of the NHS long-term plan. In it NHS England will set out how it will use the extra money the prime minister has pledged to give it over the next five years, rising to \u00a320.5bn more by 2023-24.\nImprovements to mental health care over the next five to 10 years are expected to form a key part of the document. May has made mental health a priority in her two and a half years as prime minister, and promised that the long-term plan will increase mental health\u2019s share of the NHS budget by at least \u00a32bn by 2020-21.\nThe NHS Digital data also shows that if staff employed by two community services trusts in Liverpool and Staffordshire taken over by mental health trusts are included, the overall number of those working for the latter rose by 6,748 between August 2017 and August 2018.\nHowever, that higher total includes about 5,000 staff that previously worked for the community trusts being reclassified as mental health staff as a result of the mergers.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cMental health is a key priority for the government. We are transforming services with record amounts of funding, with the NHS spending almost \u00a312bn on mental health in 2017-18.\n\u201cBut we want to go further, which is why the prime minister has made parity between physical and mental health a priority for our long-term plan for the NHS supported by at least an additional \u00a32bn a year.\u201d",

It\u2019s a bullish statement but one that may struggle to find justification over the next few weeks as Australia\u2019s men\u2019s national football team competes in its biggest event outside the World Cup.\nLogistics are far from conducive to unifying the country. 10pm AEDT is the most family friendly kick-off time during the tournament with matches at the business end of proceedings taking place in the witching hours. Add to that, all the action from the United Arab Emirates is exclusively on pay TV.\nAn absence of star power remains a hindrance to the Socceroos infiltrating the mainstream. The golden generation are now silver foxes leaving behind a cohort lacking celebrity. Much was made of Tim Cahill\u2019s ubiquity in pre-World Cup commercial activity but even he is no longer around to lend his familiar face. This will be the first open-age tournament without Cahill since the 2002 OFC Nations Cup.\nUntimely injuries to the likes of Daniel Arzani and Aaron Mooy have compounded this challenge, as has the ongoing struggle to find a first-choice striker the country can identify as a synonym for goals, the sport\u2019s most recognisable commodity. Goalkeeper Mat Ryan is arguably the Australian performing at the highest level week in week out, while the captain is an unfashionable defensive utility. Football Federation Australia\u2019s marketing department is not overwhelmed with unifying assets.\nAnd then there\u2019s the Asian issue. Australia enjoys a relationship with the continent that could still politely be described as arm\u2019s length, and this includes in football, where opportunities for integration are abundant. Asian players remain a rarity in the A-League, the Asian Champions League is neglected, and the demand for information about neighbouring leagues is far from overwhelming, despite Australia being well-served by a growing number of knowledgeable voices on the topic.\nAn example of the peculiarities of Australia\u2019s place in Asian football arrived recently when Chris Sutton slipped into troll mode. The English pundit provoked outrage by describing the Asian Cup as \u201cMickey Mouse football\u201d, using as illustration Australia\u2019s presumed ability to \u201cpump Jordan\u201d without Tom Rogic, their most creative attacker.\nIrate responses channeled the indignation that came from the Socceroos being patronisingly viewed below the Old Firm in football\u2019s global pecking order. A more satisfying riposte would have been to assert the stature of the Asian Cup, the growing quality of Asian football, and stressing the capabilities of Jordan; their victory over Denmark last year perhaps, or their ability to emerge from Rijeka as recently as October with only a 2-1 reverse at the hands of World Cup finalists Croatia.\nBut Sutton\u2019s offhand dismissal of Australia\u2019s confederation rivals fits the stereotype here as much as it does in the UK. To many, Australia\u2019s Asian Cup opponents - especially during the group phase - are unfamiliar, unheralded and consequently overlooked as a competitive threat.\nThe yearning for glamour from Europe and South America shows no sign of abating, creating an appetite destined never to be sated. Instead, the long-term project must be to shine brighter lights on the likes of Jordan, Syria and Palestine, to generate comparable levels of interest and excitement in rivalries that will recur each World Cup and Asian Cup cycle. When Thailand surprised the Socceroos home and away during World Cup qualifying there was a sense of bemusement at the level of performance. We should be thrilled at the rising standards and what that means for the competitiveness of the region; our region.\nAll of which makes Arnold\u2019s task this month in the UAE unenviable and difficult. As coach of the defending champions he has to welcome the burden of favouritism despite a depleted transitional squad. He has to convince skeptics the group phase, let alone the knockouts, will be no cakewalk, despite the expected procession.\nThe afterglow of winning the whole kit and kaboodle soon wore off for his predecessor and sympathy will be in short supply if those achievements are not repeated. The odds are stacked against him.",

It\u2019s 100% praise from me, they\u2019re so professional, no stone is left unturned to make sure everything is right for horses and jockeys.\u201d\nNicholls added words of support for Simon Claisse, who, as clerk of the course, is responsible for ensuring that ground and layout are both safe and suitable. \u201cSimon works amazingly hard and I know he feels it\u2019s a bit of a kick in the teeth because he\u2019d had no contact from them whatsoever and then reads that in the paper. But there\u2019s an awful lot of people behind him, who support him. I\u2019ve never had an owner not want to run here.\u201d\nThe Rooneys, who lost two horses to fatal injuries at Cheltenham last season, have offered no public comment as to the reason for their stance and their racing manager, Jason Maguire, declined to comment. Several trainers in their employ confirmed receiving instructions by email not to run Rooney horses at Cheltenham \u201cuntil further notice\u201d but did not wish to comment further.\nSpeculation centred on the views of Clare Rooney, said by some to have long held a preference for Flat racing, with its lower risk of injury. But there was also a suggestion that the Rooneys had found their runners at Cheltenham experienced a higher rate of injury than elsewhere.\nCheltenham officials were delighted to confirm that no horses sustained injuries during the New Year\u2019s Day action here. However they will not comment on the Rooneys until such time as the owners clarify their position with a public statement. Safety at Cheltenham was recently the subject of a voluminous report by racing\u2019s ruling body, yielding a series of recommendations including reduced field sizes.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Rooneys will still be prepared to run horses in the Grand National, for which entries will be published later this month.

At the end of June this year, there were 82,310 families in temporary accommodation, up from 55,840 in June 2013.\nIn an illustration of the extent of the capital\u2019s housing crisis, all 32 London boroughs appeared among the top 45 local authorities with the highest per capita spend on temporary accommodation.\nAbout 55,000 London households are living in temporary accommodation, and almost 70% of England\u2019s homeless families are based in the capital. Only about 6% of London\u2019s private rental market is available to families relying on housing benefit.\nMost London councils rely on small private landlords to provide their temporary accommodation. In many cases landlords can make more profit from accommodation at the bottom end of the market if it is rented to councils for homeless households.\nCouncillor Darren Rodwell, the London Councils executive member for housing and planning, said the cost of securing suitable accommodation for homeless households was growing and the situation was unsustainable.\n\u201cThese figures show how local authorities and taxpayers are being ripped off by failings in the national approach to this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to take action. It\u2019s clear we can\u2019t keep relying on increasingly expensive private-sector accommodation, so more must be done to boost provision of social housing.\u201d\nAccording to a list compiled using government figures, Hackney spent the most per head of its population (\u00a3208) on temporary accommodation, more than 10 times the national average of \u00a318.\nWhile Kensington and Chelsea did not record its spending on temporary accommodation with central government, a spokesperson said the council spent \u00a334.35m in the last financial year, an equivalent of \u00a3218 per capita. That figure does not include spending on housing Grenfell families.\nAmong the non-London councils to reach the top 45 were Luton, which came in at number 17 (\u00a377 per capita), Brighton and Hove at number 18 (\u00a376) and Milton Keynes at number 30 (\u00a338).\nManchester and Peterborough were the first areas outside the south-east to appear in the list, at 33 (\u00a330) and 40 (\u00a322) respectively. Birmingham came in 42nd place, spending \u00a320 per head on temporary accommodation.\nFiona McLeod, 37, a former probation officer, has been living in temporary accommodation provided by Hackney council since May 2017. At first she lived in a hostel for about nine months with her 15-year-old son, before moving to a small flat over the border in Tower Hamlets in February this year.\nThe flat, which consists of a small kitchen-cum-living space and two bedrooms, costs Hackney council \u00a3310 a week. The room in the hostel, with two single beds and a small shower room, costs the council \u00a3256 a week.\n The flat she is currently in is in a converted unit in an industrial estate. She can\u2019t open her windows because it allows dust into the flat from the neighbouring concrete mixing plant. \u201cIt\u2019s just stupid, the amount of money they are wasting,\u201d said McLeod. \u201cWhen I get into a council place, I\u2019m looking at paying a maximum of \u00a3115 a week.\u201d\nBefore moving into the hostel, McLeod and her son lived for a year and a half in her mother\u2019s one-bedroom flat. Her mother, who was in her 70s, slept on the sofa and McLeod and her son shared a double bed.\n\u201cI used to love Hackney,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the gentrification is disgusting. Hackney is now more or less a white borough and it never was before. It was so multicultural. Now all you\u2019ve got is these really expensive trendy bars, loads of twentysomethings with endless disposable income.\u201d\nThere are 3,000 households living in temporary accommodation in Hackney alone, with more than 13,000 households currently on the housing waiting list. One of the main causes of homelessness in the borough is the ending of tenancies because landlords want to sell properties or raise rents.\nCouncillor Rebecca Rennison, Hackney\u2019s cabinet member for finance and housing needs, said the council wanted to provide families with modern, stable council homes but the borough was facing an unprecedented housing crisis. \u201cTemporary accommodation such as hostels or B&Bs is often the only way of ensuring those in housing need can remain in Hackney while they await a more suitable place to call home,\u201d she said.\nGreg Beales, the campaign director of Shelter, said: \u201cLong queues of homeless families pleading with councils for help and a billion pounds spent on temporary accommodation are just some of the unwanted consequences of welfare cuts, rising rents and a failure to build social homes.\n\u201cAnd this bill is getting even higher as landlords charge desperate councils over the odds for some of the least suitable and worst places for homeless families to live, like emergency B&Bs.\n\u201cNot only are these incredibly expensive, families are often forced to share bathrooms and kitchens with strangers, sleep in one cramped room or even share a bed, and children are left with nowhere to play.\u201d Shelter is preparing to publish its major post-Grenfell report into the future of social housing in England in January.\nThe minister for housing and homelessness, Heather Wheeler, said: \u201cHaving somewhere to stay and a place to call home is vital in helping those who are homeless rebuild their lives, and we are determined to make this a reality.\n\u201cTemporary accommodation acts as an important safety net \u2013 ensuring that the most vulnerable have a roof over their heads until longer-term housing can be found. We\u2019re providing more than \u00a31.2bn to tackle all forms of homelessness, including funding for programmes such as the Private Rented Sector Access Fund, which will support more homeless families into long-term private rented accommodation.\u201d\nThe Guardian and Shelter looked at the rise in expenditure on temporary accommodation between 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. The analysis used ONS population estimates to work out per capita spending for each local authority, in order to account for differences in population size.\nAdditional reporting by Katherine Purvis",

        "content": "Bernardo Silva accepts that Manchester City will be under the greater pressure in Thursday night\u2019s showdown against Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium but the midfielder has urged his team to remain true to their footballing principles.\nCity enter the game with their confidence lifted by Sunday\u2019s 3-1 win at Southampton, which was timely after they suffered three defeats in the previous four Premier League matches. They sit seven points behind the leaders, Liverpool, before what is the classic so-called six-pointer. Win and City\u2019s title defence would be back in business; lose and it could be over.\nUnder Pep Guardiola City have a poor record against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, winning only one of seven meetings \u2013 the 5-0 Premier League home victory in September 2017, which was coloured by the Liverpool forward Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s 37th-minute red card. They lost 4-3 in the Anfield return last season and they were beaten home and away in the Champions League quarter-final.\nCity\u2019s approach on Thursday will be fascinating. In the league fixture at Anfield earlier in the season, which finished 0-0 after Riyad Mahrez missed a late penalty, they were more conservative than normal, slowing the tempo and exerting control in possession. Guardiola had been extremely wary of Liverpool\u2019s quick transitions.\nIt was a more typical City performance at Southampton, one in which they pressed hard and risked the ball, particularly at the back when playing out through the goalkeeper, Ederson.\nRalph Hasenh\u00fcttl, the Southampton manager, noted how City took \u201ca lot of risk to build up their game\u201d and he felt that, if his players could \u201cfind the right moment to attack and win the ball early\u201d, they could score, which is what they did when Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg equalised. City know it will be essential against Liverpool to find the right balance.\n\u201cWe know the pressure is a little bit more on us because, if we don\u2019t win, it will be very difficult to go after them,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we will try to do; it\u2019s what we try to do in every game. We\u2019ll try to play the same way that we\u2019ve been doing always \u2013 keep pressing high and having control of the ball.\n\u201cIt was good to come back against Southampton after the difficult moment of losing three out of four games in the Premier League. The team had a very solid performance and everyone\u2019s happy. I think it was really good to get a win before the game against Liverpool and get our confidence back to where it should be.\u201d\nLiverpool\u2019s attacking trio of Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah invariably draws the attention but the first thing Silva mentioned when asked about City\u2019s title rivals was their defence. Liverpool have conceded only eight goals in 20 league games and no opponent has scored more than once against them.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had a lot of clean sheets,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s an impressive defence. Everyone knows how good their front three are \u2013 they work a lot and so do the midfielders. It\u2019s a very good team. We beat them at home last season but we lost there in the Premier League and there was the Champions League, too. In the first leg they were better than us but in the second we were better than them but, because of a lot of things we don\u2019t control, we lost that game.\u201d\nSilva acknowledged it was preferable to lead from the front in a title race rather than attempt to play catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be that team than what we are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to think that we have to win every game possible. If we win on Thursday, the gap will only be four points \u2013 seven or four is very different \u2013 but we\u2019ll put some pressure into them. They\u2019re unbeaten until now in the league. We\u2019ll try to end that.\u201d",

        "content": "Harry Kane was again on the receiving end of new year\u2019s honours after helping Tottenham Hotspur turn up the heat on their title rivals by snatching back second place in the Premier League. Four days after being awarded an MBE, Kane opened the scoring after 141 seconds and, in doing so, broke his duck against Cardiff City at the fourth time of asking, having netted against every other one of the 27 top-flight teams he has faced.\nKane was the catalyst in a game that was over inside half an hour, feeding Son Heung-min for Spurs\u2019 slick third after having a hand in the buildup to a typically classy Christian Eriksen strike from the edge of the box.\nJolted back into being the hunter as opposed to the hunted, Spurs seemed to enjoy themselves. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged his players to rise to the role of protagonists here and, while they remain six points off the summit having played an extra game, they issued a timely reminder to Manchester City and Liverpool, who meet on Thursday, that they are determined to make life as interesting as possible.\nPochettino will be a keen observer \u2013 a neutral, he said, though victory for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side would surely enhance Spurs\u2019 chances in the title race. After slipping up against Wolves, a trip to south Wales had the makings of another difficult evening against a promoted team. It proved anything but as Spurs, impeccably led by Kane, blew away a desperately porous defence with three goals in 26 first-half minutes, feasting on a calamitous Cardiff collapse. Kane got the ball rolling before Eriksen\u2019s assassin-like finish and an arrowed effort by Son sealed the most routine of victories.\nFor Cardiff, this was yet another damning defeat against one of the league\u2019s big-hitters, with Spurs sapping the life out of a side hoping to build on a character-building win at Leicester.\nCardiff\u2019s record against the league\u2019s so-called \u201cbig six\u201d was naturally a concern, having lost their previous 14 meetings, the latest of which was a 5-1 \u201cbattering\u201d, as Neil Warnock put it, against Manchester United last month.\nHe would have been right to fear this would go the same way when Kane struck the opener, with the ball bobbling in off his right shin after Sean Morrison\u2019s failed clearance under pressure from Dele Alli, before Eriksen doubled Spurs\u2019 lead on 12 minutes. Warnock had warned his players \u201cnot to breathe\u201d on the opposition but they afforded them too much respect altogether. This was so easy for Spurs. The pained grimace on Warnock\u2019s face said as much.\nCardiff passed up their best spell before Spurs\u2019 killer second, the returning Danny Rose leaping highest at the back post to head away Josh Murphy\u2019s high cross with Callum Paterson, the Cardiff forward, for company, a minute after Toby Alderweireld cut out Murphy\u2019s low ball.\nKane, who started and finished the opener and had a hand in the second and third too, freed Moussa Sissoko down the right with a spearing, sweeping through-ball. Sissoko centred for Son, who fed Eriksen. Harry Arter went to ground as the Dane composed himself, teasing Bruno Ecuele Manga by dragging the ball back and forth, and giving Neil Etheridge the eyes as he shaped to bend an effort into the far corner before rolling a cunning low strike inside the near post.\nAny of the feelgood factor that Cardiff had fostered from that last-gasp victory at Leicester last weekend had certainly wilted by the time Son added a simple third. Kane was again involved, effortlessly pushing a first-time pass into the path of his teammate after more good running by the formidable Sissoko down Tottenham\u2019s right. Son dispatched another rising effort over the bar moments later but it did not matter. The game was done and dusted with an hour to play.\nKane would have scored a second himself but for a superb block by Morrison, the Cardiff captain, midway through the second half. When Spurs did opt to grind through the gears, with the game already out of sight, Kane was at the heart of everything. Sol Bamba ran into trouble on the halfway line, with Sissoko cutting out his hopeful pass and picking out the striker. Again Cardiff were exposed, Etheridge faced with four Spurs forwards, but back came Bamba to deflect Son\u2019s low effort on to the Cardiff goalkeeper\u2019s shoulder and away.\nThen Aron Gunnarsson acrobatically denied a probing Alli in the box. Cardiff had failed this test miserably but, with 15 minutes left to play, it was time for Spurs to experiment. Fernando Llorente made a late cameo, in place of Alli, while the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp replaced Son, the academy graduate gaining some more valuable minutes before his likely involvement against Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup on Friday. The League Two side could do with making that match somewhat less of a stroll.",

A convincing 3-0 win lifts Spurs to second in the table and narrows the gap to the league summit to six points, before the leaders Liverpool\u2019s clash with Manchester City on Thursday.\nGoals from Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min sealed a return to winning ways after a shock defeat by Wolves at Wembley on Saturday. \u201cI think it was a massive victory, a massive three points to make us believe that little more, in our possibility to be in a very good position in the table,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think it was so important to start the new year with a victory, away from home, at a very difficult place. I think they arrived with massive confidence after the last game [against Leicester].\n\u201cFrom the beginning today we showed massive energy and I think that is the team we want, and expect, to see to get a good performance on the pitch. I think it was so important to start to build another positive run and, of course in football it is impossible to win every single game, but for sure we are going try to win every single game until the end. I think it was so important for everyone, for confidence, because in three days we are going to start another competition, the FA Cup [against Tranmere], which is going to be important too and then the semi-final of the Carabao Cup against Chelsea.\u201d\nThe Cardiff manager, Neil Warnock, believes the Premier League should intervene to stop Tottenham moving to the new White Hart Lane this season. Warnock says his side\u2019s relegation rivals could gain an unfair advantage by not playing Tottenham at Wembley, with Huddersfield among teams that are likely to face Spurs at their new stadium, which they hope will open by February.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made cock-ups now with the timing,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cThe league should enforce they play at Wembley now for the rest of the season. I don\u2019t think there should be any chance of an advantage to any of our opponents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our fault. We should have been playing at the new stadium ourselves. I think they should step in now. It should be until the end of the season now. I think they should enforce it.\u201d",

But I can certainly say that being lobbied for votes is an integral part of a political process and it does not constitute bullying.\u201d\nHenderson\u2019s comments came just days after her former Liberal colleague Julia Banks gave an interview to the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, where she once again spoke of the bullying and intimidation she said MPs were subjected to during the leadership spill.\nIn her editorial, Reynolds repeated the argument she made several times last year; that a quota system, like the one Labor instigated, which has led to almost 50% women representation, did not help create cultural change.\nReynolds said without the quota, she believed the number of women in Labor ranks would revert to what they once were, as nothing had been done to encourage a natural cultural shift within the party\u2019s core.\n\u201cQuotas in and of themselves are a quick fix, but they do not change the structural and cultural barriers in an organisation. In the absence of other organisational transformations, when quotas are \u00adremoved the changes do not stick,\u201d she wrote.\nGreat to see an article about women  based on fact and real evidence in today\u2019s press. Wise Women definitely have a better life and Independence is key. Well done @ShivaniGopal1 \ud83d\udc4f#FinancialIndependence4Women @FutureWomen @honourawoman @DailyLifeAu @WomensWeeklyMag #AusPol https://t.co/Ie8UlD3we8\nPlibersek said those justifications were laughable.\n\u201cLabor has more than double the number of women the Liberals have in the parliament and about the twice the number of women on our front bench,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks for itself.\n\u201cOver the last five years, all Scott Morrison and the Liberals have done is deliver policies that disadvantage women. The Liberals tried five times to slash paid parental leave, and called working mums \u2018rorters\u2019 and \u2018double dippers\u2019.\n\u201cThe Liberals argued against increases to the minimum wage that substantially benefit women \u2026 and they also tried to cut around $35m from Community Legal Centres that provide crucial legal services to family violence victims.\u201d\nIn September, several Liberal women MPs wore red on the same day, in a sartorial protest against the treatment of women, inspired by the red shoes Julie Bishop wore as she announced her resignation from the front bench, following Scott Morrison\u2019s ascent to the prime minister\u2019s suite.\nHenderson pointed to the women\u2019s economic statement, reinstated as part of the budget by Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, who, in a meeting with Morrison and Victorian MPs following the November state election, reportedly said the Liberal party was viewed as \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate change deniers\u201d.\nO\u2019Dwyer has not disputed the reports, but, pressed in question time that same month, said she believed the Coalition to be \u201cthe natural government for Australian women\u201d.\nPrivately, O\u2019Dwyer had lobbied for an independent complaints review process to be established within the Liberal party\u2019s federal and state executives to deal with the issue, which Morrison, attempting to stem the damaging ongoing flow of allegations, agreed to in September, the same day as the red sartorial protest.",

Hong Kong was down 2.7%, Shanghai off 1.2% and the ASX 200 benchmark closed down 1.6% in Sydney. In South Korea, figures showed that its crucial export industries finished the year on a poor note, sending the Kospi stock index down 1.7% at the end of trading.\nAsia biggest market, Japan, was closed for a holiday. But the selling looks set to spread to Europe and the US with FTSE futures pointing to a 0.25% fall at the open and the E-Mini futures for Wall Street\u2019s S&P 500 down 0.8%.\nThe Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy, lost 0.6% as it plunged as low as US70.05 cents. It was the currency\u2019s lowest level since January 2016 and perilously close to dipping below the key trading benchmark of US70c that, once breached, could spur further falls.\nThe Australian outlook was not helped by figures showing that house prices are now falling at their fastest rate for 10 years.\nIn China, the Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for December fell to 49.7, from 50.2 in November. A number below 50 represents a contraction. It was the first time it has shrunk for 19 months.\nTaiwan also saw a contraction in manufacturing in December while official data in Singapore showed that gross domestic product grew more slowly than forecast in the fourth quarter as the city-state\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted on a quarterly basis.\nThe Asia data made it more difficult for traders and investors to ignore what looks like \u201ca genuine global economic slowdown\u201d, said Australian market strategist Greg McKenna.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still difficult to be strongly positive given all the uncertainties,\u201d said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.\nWith business conditions expected to get worse before they get better, China is expected to roll out more support measures in coming months on top of a raft of initiatives in 2018.\n\u201cThis data confirms our view that the economy is weak and that stimulus needs to arrive quickly,\u201d said analysts at ING in a note.\nThe position of the US Federal Reserve remains the key to market sentiment over the next 12 months, along with talks between the US and China to end their trade standoff.\nThe chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, signalled that there could be two more rate hikes this year, adding to the four he oversaw in 2018.\nBut many market observers, not to mention Donald Trump, think that the US central bank risks sucking the life out of the booming US economy and emerging markets that are heavily geared to the US dollar.\nFederal Reserve fund futures have all but priced out any hike for this year and now imply a quarter-point cut by mid 2020. The treasury market also assumes the Fed is done and dusted with bond yields \u2013 a key indicator of real interest rates \u2013 now beginning to fall after rising during 2018.\nPowell will have the chance to comment on the economic outlook when he participates in a joint discussion with his predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday.\nAlso looming is a closely-watched survey on US manufacturing due on Thursday, followed by the December payrolls report on Friday.\n\u201cWhat is clear is that the global synchronised growth story that propelled risk assets higher has come to the end of its current run,\u201d analysts at OCBC Bank wrote in a note.\nThe pullback in the dollar and the chance of and end to US rate hikes have been boons for gold, which fetched $1,280.40 an ounce to be close to a six-month peak.\nOil prices flagged again after a punishing 2018. On Wednesday, US crude futures eased 2 cents to $45.39 a barrel, while Brent fell 18 cents to $53.64.\nReuters contributed to this report.",

Vietnam\u2019s ministry of public security said it will tackle \u201chostile and reactionary forces\u201d, but human rights groups said it was authorities\u2019 latest method of silencing free speech.\nThe Vietnam government has intensified a crackdown on criticism since 2016, jailing dozens of dissidents. Spreading information deemed to be anti-government or anti-state online is now illegal in the country, as is using the internet to \u201cpost false information that could cause confusion and damage to socio-economic activities\u201d.\nLast week, the country\u2019s Association of Journalists published a code of conduct banning reporters from posting information that could \u201crun counter\u201d to the state on social media. Daniel Bastard of Reporters Without Borders called the measures \u201ca totalitarian model of information control\u201d.\nThe government has asked Facebook and Google to open offices in Vietnam, and to agree to comply with the new censorship and user data rules. Hanoi claimed that Google has put steps in place to open a base in the country, although the search engine has not confirmed this. In response to the new law, Facebook said it would protect users\u2019 rights and safety.\nPhil Robertson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy Asia director, said the legislation was \u201cthe legal equivalent of a hammer to bash online critics, with overly broad provisions that can be easily used to classify almost any critical comment as criminal.\u201d\nHe told the Guardian: \u201cWhile it\u2019s likely that activists who have previously spoken up against government abuses will be targeted first, the government\u2019s longer-term plan is to bring the internet under the same draconian controls that affect print media, TV and radio. The government\u2019s new year gift to its citizens is intensified fear about what they can say online, and uncertainty about what issues and statements will trigger arrests and prosecution.\u201d",

        "content": "Wenlock Edge, Shropshire: The assemblage and colours of lichens, mosses and ferns have the mysterious allure of a painting\nThe greys and greens of lichens, mosses and ferns on the wall capture my attention. Walking past Wenlock priory in the last wintry light before rain, heading elsewhere, I\u2019m transfixed by a half-metre square of stones in the perimeter wall on which grows an assemblage of tiny plants. What I\u2019m watching begins with the mysterious allure of a painting: a surface of colours and shapes, the relationships between them creating something without any pretence to meaning; it just is.\nLooking further, the composition has garden qualities: the natural beauty of juxtapositions of plants and stones, but on a vertical plane and with no human involvement bar the building of the wall centuries ago and periodic maintenance to stop it falling down. The plants arrived by themselves and exist without the care of a gardener.\nLooking more closely, I\u2019m taken by the architecture of the plants. The grey is a lichen that looks like a handful of zinc powder thrown at the wall. It\u2019s a dust lichen, Lepraria, a soft powderiness made up of granules of fungus hyphae (feeding filaments) and the alga that does the photosynthesis; there are no sexual reproduction bodies, no defining outline; a saxicolous lichen that grows on rock.\nThe greens are cushions of wall screw-moss, Tortula muralis, and other Schistidium mosses that like masonry. They cover the stone like tiny woods, coverts and copses gathering around the spectacular little maidenhair spleenwort, Asplenium trichomanes, with its fronds of black stems holding yellow-green pinnae, leaflets, emerging from a crack between stones.\nI look up, at the ruins of the medieval priory, and get a very different view of this slow, natural process of erosion and dereliction. Thinking about those who worked on these great stone buildings, I\u2019m reminded of John Ruskin, the Victorian visionary, writing of a sculptor who took inspiration from the \u201cstudy of the minute and various work of Nature\u201d that it \u201cmade him feel more forcefully the barrenness of what was best in that of man\u201d (On Art and Life). Whole lifetimes of sculptors and masons were spent before such works as these were accomplished. Now, how beautifully they fall back into Nature\u2019s minute and various works.",

        "content": "As we reflect on a year of extreme weather and ominous climate talks, Guardian environment writer Fiona Harvey explains why 2019 could see some much-needed breakthroughs\nExtreme weather hit the headlines throughout 2018, from the heatwave across much of the northern hemisphere, which saw unprecedented wildfires in Sweden, drought in the UK and devastating wildfires in the US, to floods in India and typhoons in south-east Asia.\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organisation, last year was the fourth hottest on record and confirms a trend of rising temperatures that is a clear signal that we are having an effect on the climate. Droughts, floods, fiercer storms and heatwaves, as well as sea level rises, are all expected to increase markedly as a result.\nLate in the year there was also the starkest warning yet from scientists of what our future will be if we allow climate change to take hold. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, which has been producing regular reports on the state of climate science since 1988, produced its latest comprehensive overview examining what the future will look like if we undergo 1.5C (2.7F) of warming.\nThat does not sound like a lot \u2013 most people would be hard put to notice a temperature difference of 1.5C \u2013 but in climate terms, 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is enough to take us into the danger zone. It would see the mass die-off of coral reefs, the extinction of some species, rising sea levels, wet areas of the world becoming wetter and dry areas drier, and the decline of agricultural productivity across swaths of the globe.\nThat is a future we should obviously try to avoid. But the UN climate conference in Poland that ended the year\u2019s climate-related events in December showed little sign that the urgency of the scientists\u2019 warnings had been heeded. Instead, countries discussed a \u201crulebook\u201d for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice, including such arcane matters as how countries measure and verify their emissions, and how often they should report on them, and rows over carbon credits.\nIn Poland, there were no firm commitments to ramp up countries\u2019 national targets in line with scientific advice, and this is unlikely to happen before 2020 at the earliest. On current national emissions-cutting targets, we are in for about 3C of warming. Yet the IPCC warned that if we want to avoid 1.5C of warming, we have about 12 years to bring global emissions under control and swiftly move to just half of their current level. That represents a massive shift needed in the global economy, and yet emissions worldwide look to be moving upward again slightly after a decade in which they showed signs of stabilising.\nThere was also bad news from the US at the talks, which played little part as Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Paris agreement, except to hold a side event at the conference celebrating a bright future for coal.\nLooked at this way, the omens from 2018 were not good. Fortunately, however, 2019 may indeed be a breakthrough year. Public opinion is mobilising around the world and politicians and businesses are paying attention. There will be a series of high-profile events that will engage the public and governments and may provide a better way forward than was managed last year.\nChief among them is the promise of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, to hold a summit for world leaders that will require them to face up to the dangers of climate change head on. Guterres is uncompromising, warning in Poland that it would be \u201cimmoral and suicidal\u201d not to take firm and urgent action commensurate with the scale of the problem.\nLeaders will be put on the spot, and will come under very public pressure as coalitions of civil society groups seek to put their case around the summit and in the lead-up to it. The role of women, who are among the most vulnerable to climate change, will be highlighted, and the role of young people, who will have to live with the consequences of their elders\u2019 mistakes in a warming world.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, is also holding a One World Summit, planned for the summer, at which the focus will be on persuading businesses to take a leading role, investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and changing the way they use energy.\nThere are clear signs of hope on climate change also in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy technology, which is now competitive with fossil fuels. And the Keep it in the ground campaign has succeeded in encouraging many investors to move their money out of fossil fuel stocks.\nBut most of all the civil society campaigns which have ramped up in 2018 and look set to increase their momentum in the coming year are taking effect. Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue. This can be seen in some unexpected ways, such as the rise of veganism and flexitarian eating, as people seek to reduce their impact on the climate from eating meat. Through well-publicised and effective movements and actions, more and more people are refusing silently to acquiesce in ignoring the dangers to the climate.",

        "content": "From overpriced tickets to overcrowded trains. Here\u2019s what commuters don\u2019t like about our railways\nMolly Conisbee, 46, a researcher, commutes from Oldfield Park in Bath to Bristol for work and also cares for an elderly relative in London, regularly travelling from Bath Spa to Paddington \u2013 \u201cpaying anything \u00a350 to \u00a3150 depending on time of day and urgency with which I need to travel\u201d.\n\u201cI have done the Bath-Bristol commute for nigh on 13 years and it has never been so poor. Pretty much every day one or both journeys are heavily delayed or cancelled. Trains are packed. The number of services from my local Bath station have been reduced despite massive housebuilding in the area meaning, presumably, more commuters. Often toilets don\u2019t work and the trains are filthy.\n\u201cThe staff seem ground down and sometimes are understandably pissed off with customers because they are the front line of the service and bear the brunt of our complaints. I have written to GWR to complain and what is frustrating is that you get a response that could have been written by a robot. There is zero-accountability for the terrible service, and the frontline staff are left to bear the brunt of all of our frustrations as travellers.\u201d\nCourtenay Blench, 27, an account manager, commutes at peak times from Brighton to Wimbledon with an annual season ticket costing \u00a34,000. She has two changes, at Haywards Heath and Clapham Junction.\n\u201cI\u2019m commuting on a Southern train so it\u2019s like being in the seventh circle of hell \u2013 a never-ending limbo of delayed trains, strikes, cancellations, reduced services, overcrowding and seats so small you\u2019re sat on top of your neighbour. Thankfully I only have to commute three days a week, but that\u2019s still a good six hours spent on the disastrous service. Poor souls who go the full five.\n\u201cThere are delays nearly every day which is not helped by the fact I get three separate trains. If any one of them are delayed then my journey is considerably longer. Trains are frequently overcrowded. It\u2019s practically inhumane how crowded they can get. God help you if you want to reach the bathroom. Since the new timetable came in the Brighton to London service is less frequent and there are no direct trains to Clapham at peak times \u2013 what madness is that?\u201d\nLesley Ferrando, an employment regulatory specialist, commutes at peak times from Woking to Waterloo which costs \u00a321 per day, \u00a3400 per month.\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, a rip-off. I dread the two hours [travelling time] that it\u2019s become. The service is completely unreliable, and there\u2019s been a massive decline over the last 18 months. Trains are delayed every single day. It affects my job, my health and my social life. It drains me, stresses me and prevents me from doing other things because I can\u2019t plan anything.\n\u201cTrains are mostly overcrowded and getting a seat is a mission. It\u2019s often uncomfortable, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to pass out. I can often only get on the second or third train.\u201d\nDavid Handley, 41, a lawyer, commutes from Peterborough to King\u2019s Cross on LNER \u2013 with an annual season ticket costing \u00a38,412.50 including tube travel \u2013 about to rise to \u00a38,680.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. Not only is it half the national average wage \u2013 taking tax into account \u2013 the service rarely works. There are delays almost on a daily basis. It might only be a few minutes a day but over the course of a year those minutes add up to significant lost time. The delays are also mainly caused by avoidable issues such as broken down trains or signal failures. Though the services seem to be the same in number, the times \u2013 especially in the morning \u2013 have become much less convenient.\u201d\nJulie Smith, 42, works for a mental health charity in Leeds, commutes from Huddersfield on a \u00a31,662.80 annual corporate pass, which is deducted from her wage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than it would be if I were paying on a daily basis, but I don\u2019t feel that the continued rise of rail fares is justified, given that the service is so unreliable and overcrowded.\n\u201cThe service is terrible. Overcrowded, unreliable and comparatively expensive. My trains are delayed every day, that\u2019s the only thing that is reliable! Often I check the train times online on my way to the station and they look to be running on time. I get to the station to find that they are usually running at least 5-10 mins late. On some occasions they are cancelled due to the lack of a driver. It\u2019s worse in the evening rush hour. I often let the train go and wait for the next to arrive. There are additional train services on this line, but these are very unreliable.\u201d\nRory Oliver, 41, software developer in London, commutes from Bearsted to Blackfriars, paying \u00a3113 per week (\u00a3116.60 from January).\n\u201cI work four days a week so am currently overpaying by around 20%. I don\u2019t bother buying an annual as when you calculate holidays etc it\u2019s no saving over buying a weekly.\n\u201cOur journey is 39 miles and it takes 90 minutes or so. Absolutely disgraceful! It is often late, and is always full. It never arrives within 60 secs of the advertised arrival time so I would say it\u2019s late 100% of the time. My train is overcrowded; it is eight carriages when it should be 12. I get on quite early in the journey but I feel for those more than two to three stations further down the line as they never get a seat.\u201d\nAlison Johnson, 50, commutes at peak from New Mills Central to Ashburys, buying a \u00a39.70 open return (\u00a310 from January) as she is not in the Manchester office every day.\n\u201cI catch the train, not because it\u2019s more convenient, quicker, easier or cheaper but because I feel strongly that commuting by car is ecologically a choice I shouldn\u2019t be making. The pricing policy is mind-boggling. Promise after promise of improvement is made but in reality all we get is deterioration of the service.\n\u201cSince I started this commute four years ago the cost has gone up, the frequency of trains has reduced, and the short-formed trains are more and more frequent in rush hour. I checked the figures for last month and my evening train was delayed on 100% of its journeys. My train to work leaves on time but is consistently 5\u20137 minutes late by the time it reaches its destination.\n\u201cOvercrowding is horrific. The train company don\u2019t seem to understand the consequences of halving the capacity on a rush-hour train. Now there\u2019s one train an hour and if the target train is too full to get on it\u2019s a long time until the next one on a station without a waiting room, exposed to the elements of Manchester\u2019s unholy winter weather.\u201d\nJason Flynn, 46, an insurance broker, commutes at peak times from Letchworth to King\u2019s Cross, with an annual season ticket costing \u00a34216 (\u00a34338 from January)\n\u201cSince May 2018, it\u2019s been terrible. Since late August it has been better but still too many trains cancelled or delayed. It is often overcrowded. Unless you leave home at 6am, many of the 7am\u20138am trains can be standing room only; it really varies. Overall I\u2019ve never had to leave home so early, so regularly, in my entire working life.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also lost services. The majority of fast trains in the evenings disappeared in May 2018 but most are coming back in December due to amazing work by our local Rail Users Group.\n\u201cThe buck stops with the goverment and the [Department for Transport). Terrible management and huge lack of investment for over 30+ years means we are where we are. The current model is broken. National Rail get away nearly scot-free, hiding behind the blame generated against the train companies; they need to take their share of the blame and in plain sight, not hiding in the shadows.\u201d\nCase studies and quotes are from Guardian readers who responded to a Guardian callout",

It is based on the true story of two noblewomen creating a horribly dysfunctional love triangle by competing for the queen\u2019s favours: Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail, Baroness Basham \u2013 played by Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone.UK release date: 1 January\nDirs: Julie Cohen, Betsy West / Mimi Leder\n  These films count as one choice! It feels like an especially fraught moment to contemplate the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose forthright liberal judgments have made her a pop culture legend. RBG is a documentary directed by Julie Cohen and Betsy West; On the Basis of Sex is a feature starring Felicity Jones as RBG. RBG: 4 January; On the Basis of Sex: 8 February\nDir: Catherine Corsini\n The fierce and passionate direction of Catherine Corsini is applied to this French melodrama of love and sexism, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Christine Angot. In the 1950s, a young secretary (Virginie Efira) has a passionate affair with a wealthy young man (Niels Schneider); she bears a child whom he refuses to acknowledge, so she must bring up their daughter alone.4 January\nDir: Jason Reitman\n  It sounds so quaint in the brazen era of Donald Trump: the story of how, in 1988, the smoothly plausible Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart had all his hopes sunk by accusations of an extramarital affair. Hugh Jackman plays the presentable Hart, the estimable Vera Farmiga is his wife Oletha, and Sara Paxton is the other woman, Donna Rice, who endured the full misogynistic force of the press coverage.11 January\nDir: Wash WestmorelandKeira Knightley plays the great French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who as a young woman in belle \u00e9poque Paris was married to the notorious womaniser and rackety journalist Henry Gauthier-Villars (played here by Dominic West), who insisted on putting his name on the novels she wrote at first \u2013 and getting all the money. The director is Wash Westmoreland, who directed Still Alice; he co-wrote the screenplay with his partner, the late Richard Glatzer.11 January\nDir: Jon S Baird\n  Steve Coogan and John C Reilly give wonderfully observed performances as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in this sad, sweet, true-life movie about the British tour they undertook after the second world war, in dire need of money. They endure miserable digs, second-rate theatres, terrible weather and the fact that their local promoter seems more excited about a new young comic called Norman Wisdom.11 January\nDir: Felix Van Groeningen\n  There can hardly be anyone hotter right now than Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; here he plays a teenage meth abuser, Nic, whose addiction causes agony to his dad David, played by Steve Carell. The film is based on parallel father-and-son memoirs of this same experience.18 January\nDir: Josie Rourke\n  Screenwriter Beau Willimon, an old hand at American political thrillers, transfers his skills to scripting English and Scottish history with this tale of Mary, Queen of Scots, played by Saoirse Ronan. Margot Robbie plays her nemesis, Queen Elizabeth I, and David Tennant is the gloweringly suspicious churchman John Knox. Read our interview with the film\u2019s director, Josie Rourke.18 January\nDir: Clint Eastwood\n  At 88 years of age, Clint Eastwood is showing no signs of slowing down. He directs this film based on a startling true-life story, and also stars as Earl, a second world war veteran who, in 2011, was discovered by astonished law enforcement officials to be the oldest drug mule in America, smuggling substances over the border into the US. Bradley Cooper plays the cop on his case.25 January\nDir: Karyn KusamaNicole Kidman\u2019s self-transformation in this brutally tough crime thriller has been much acclaimed on the festival circuit. She plays Erin Bell, an FBI agent who has lost it, psychologically and physically, after going deep undercover with mobsters, and cuts a tortured figure as her life falls apart. Now she gets the chance to reckon with the people who damaged her.25 January\nDir: Adam McKay\n  The former US vice-president, big oil nabob and waterboarding enthusiast Dick Cheney squats like a latex-inflated toad at the ear of power in this flashy political comedy from Adam McKay about the power behind the throne of George W Bush. It\u2019s a scarily plausible impersonation from Christian Bale, whose bald-capped head has been enlarged to the size of a pale pink, bespectacled beachball. Amy Adams is on great form as Cheney\u2019s formidable wife Lynne, with Sam Rockwell as Dubya and Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld..25 January\nDir: Marielle Heller\n  With a screenplay by that great and underrated film-maker Nicole Holofcener, this tragicomic true-life story of fakery looks mouthwatering. Melissa McCarthy plays Lee Israel, a once bestselling biographer who fell on hard times and turned to counterfeiting literary manuscripts.1 February\nDir: Lee Chang-dong\n  This superbly subtle mystery thriller from Korean auteur Lee Chang-dong is for many people the film of the year. It is a love triangle which turns into a fear triangle and a hate triangle, based on a short story by Haruki Murakami. A young man falls in love with a beautiful young woman who dumps him in favour of a rich smoothie who has a creepy obsession with setting things on fire. Then she disappears. What has happened?1 February\nDir: Sara Colangelo Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an unhappy woman in this American indie drama, remade from a 2014 film by Israeli director Nadav Lapid. She is naggingly unfulfilled in her family life and professional career as a teacher and then becomes obsessed with the idea that one of her kids is a genius.8 February\nDir: Barry JenkinsBarry Jenkins, whose Moonlight won the best picture Oscar two years ago, returns with this impassioned adaptation of the 1974 James Baldwin novel. It is a story of love and injustice in 1970s Harlem, when a young man is falsely accused of rape and his pregnant girlfriend has to prove his innocence.8 February\nDir: Ali Abbasi \n This bizarre Swedish film, adapted from a story by horror-fiction author John Ajvide Lindqvist, has comprehensively weirded out all who have seen it. A young customs officer has what amounts to a professional superpower: she can smell fear. But when she applies that skill to a guilty-looking person who resembles her, a strange story unfolds.8 February\nDir: Stephen Merchant \n Stephen Merchant directs this British comedy about wrestling, effectively remade from a documentary about a WWE wrestler in the US. Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden play Saraya and Zak, a brother and sister who are both talented wrestlers, but have a terrible sibling rivalry when they audition for WWE.1 March\nDirs: Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck\n  This is Marvel Studios\u2019 first female-led superhero film and its first with a female director: Anna Boden. Brie Larson plays Carol Danvers, a former US air force fighter pilot whose DNA becomes fused with that of a Kree \u2013 a militaristic alien being \u2013 giving her superpowers.8 March\nDir: Alice RohrwacherOne of the most gorgeous and beguiling films on the festival circuit now gets a release. It is a lovely magic-realist fable set among an exploited peasant community who appear to be living in the 19th century \u2013 yet this is misleading. Among them is the happy idiot boy Lazzaro, who, like his namesake, is destined to be mysteriously reborn.15 March\nDir: Jordan PeeleJordan Peele\u2019s satirical horror movie about racism, Get Out, made him a hot property, and now we have a movie about which little is known, other than that the director is calling it a \u201csocial-horror thriller\u201d. It stars Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Winston Duke and Elisabeth Moss.15 March\nDir: Lukas Dhont\n This is a much admired Belgian movie about trans issues \u2013 though it has been criticised for using a cisgender actor in the lead. Lara, played by Victor Polster, is a 15-year-old transitioning to female, yearning to be a ballerina, and facing incomprehension and transphobia along with all the other hurdles a dancer must endure.15 March\nDir: Carol Morley\n  Here is a movie straight out of left field: a metaphysical noir starring Patricia Clarkson as a tough New Orleans cop investigating the mysterious death of an astrophysicist \u2013 based on the Martin Amis novel Night Train. Director Carol Morley is such a restlessly creative film-maker. 22 March\nDir: Ralph Fiennes\n  David Hare scripts this handsomely appointed drama starring Oleg Ivenko as the young Rudolf Nureyev as he prepares to defect to the west in the early 60s, while remaining enigmatic about his exact motives. Real-life dance star Sergei Polunin plays his Kirov roommate, Yuri Soloviev.22 March\nDir: Adam Shankman\n  A cheeky gender-inverting remake of Nancy Meyers\u2019s 2000 comedy What Women Want, which starred Mel Gibson as an adman who suddenly finds he can read women\u2019s minds. Now it\u2019s Taraji P Henson as a sports agent who gets the edge when she gains telepathic access to guys\u2019 thought processes.22 March\nDir: Tim Burton\n Just when you\u2019d recovered from the tearful trauma of the 1941 Disney animated classic, there comes a new live-action version. Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito star.29 March\nDirs: Kevin K\u00f6lsch, Dennis Widmeyer\n Stephen King\u2019s brand identity in the horror world is as strong as ever, and here is the second movie version of his 1983 novel. It is the exquisitely horrible and obscene story of a doctor whose son is killed in an accident and who takes the corpse to the supernatural burial ground nearby \u2013 with grotesque results.5 April\nDir: Jacques Audiard\n  French director Jacques Audiard has mastered the western with terrific elan. It is 1850s Oregon, and John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play quarrelsome brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters, who are on a mission to assassinate a certain individual in San Francisco, and have to work with a prissy private detective, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.5 April\nDir: Paolo Sorrentino\n  It was only a matter of time before Paolo Sorrentino made a film about Silvio Berlusconi. Sorrentino\u2019s longtime star Toni Servillo plays the Italian politician and media magnate, and the film is about Loro (that is: them), the group of hideously complicit businessmen and hangers-on who enabled his rule.12 April\nDir: Trevor Nunn \n  Theatrical heavyweight Trevor Nunn makes a rare sortie into the movies for this period drama inspired by the life and times of the KGB\u2019s veteran British spy Melita Norwood. Here she is transformed into \u201cRed\u201d Joan Stanley, and played as a young woman by Sophie Cookson and in later years by Judi Dench.19 April\nDir: Bo BurnhamA hyper-contemporary comedy-drama from first-time writer-director Bo Burnham (and veteran producer Scott Rudin) that has been much admired. It is about an eighth-grader (ie around 13 years old) who is obsessed with social media and keeps making self-help and self-esteem videos on YouTube which, by getting hardly any views, undermine her self-esteem.26 April",

        "content": "Victoria says it has no plans to introduce pill testing, but the issue looks likely to feature in the NSW election\nWhile Victorian government has ruled out a shift towards pill testing at music festivals the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has softened her stance.\nPill testing is likely to become a NSW election issue, with the state\u2019s opposition opening the door to supporting the measure.\nLate last year Berejiklian, ruled out introducing pill testing after a 19-year-old\u2019s death at dance party at Sydney Olympic Park.\nBut on Wednesday she appeared to soften her stance and said she would consider it if her government was shown evidence it saved lives.\n\u201cIf there was a way in which we could ensure that lives were saved through pill testing we would consider it \u2013 but there is no evidence provided to the government on that,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters.\nThe premier convened an expert panel into festival safety in September 2018 after two people died at the Defqon.1 event in western Sydney.\nThe political reluctance is frustrating for heartbroken parents like Adriana Buccianti who lost her son to an overdose.\nBuccianti is still haunted by memories of the January morning the police knocked at her door with news her son had died.\nIt was 8.30am and she was babysitting her granddaughter when officers arrived with news that Daniel had been found after taking a drug at a festival.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re having this out-of-body experience, you\u2019re watching your body walk around really slow. My mind was going really fast but my body wouldn\u2019t move. I do remember screaming and my neighbour next door came in,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything so horrific in my life. Your kids are not supposed to go before you.\u201d\nHer 34-year-old son\u2019s body had been found in his tent after his drug overdose at the Rainbow Serpent festival in western Victoria in 2012.\n\u201cHe never imagined that he would have taken something that he\u2019d never taken before, so if the [pill-testing] service was available he would have used it,\u201d Buccianti said. \u201cNobody wants to come out of there in a body bag.\u201d\nBuccianti said pill testing would provide a safety net to help protect youngsters \u201cfrom themselves\u201d.\n\u201cHow many body counts do they want before somebody does something about it?\u201d she said.\nThe Victorian mental health minister, Martin Foley, said the government had no plans to allow pill testing as the state reeled from another death.\nA 20-year-old Victorian man died in hospital on Tuesday, days after suffering a suspected drug overdose at the Beyond the Valley festival south-east of Melbourne.\nVictorian police said six people had been arrested for drug trafficking and 26 had received a caution and drug diversion notice during the four-day event.\nFoley said Victoria police had advised that pill testing could give people \u201ca false, and potentially fatal, sense of security about illicit drugs\u201d.\nEarlier this week, organisers of the Falls festival sent out a warning to ticket holders of a \u201cdangerous orange pill\u201d in circulation, following the suspected drug death of a 22-year-old man on the New South Wales central coast.\nNSW police on Wednesday charged six people with drug supply offences after they were allegedly caught carrying illicit drugs, including MDMA and ketamine, at a music festival in Sydney\u2019s Domain.\nThe Australian Capital Territory emergency department doctor David Caldicott is adamant a new approach is needed and overdoses need to be treated as a public health issue.\nFor hospitals and paramedics all over the country, the summer music festival calendar has the same sense of inevitability and dread as bushfire season, Caldicott said.\n\u201cThere is no part of the emergency medical response that wouldn\u2019t be delighted to never have to deal with this ever again,\u201d Caldicott said.\nOften unconscious patients have no identification and hospital staff have to try to unlock mobile phones with fingerprints to find a next of kin.\n\u201cThat never becomes easy, it\u2019s one of the worst aspects of the jobs \u2013 contacting parents about severe harm that\u2019s happened to their children which up until that point they were blissfully unaware of,\u201d he said.\nHe said 12 to 15 years ago doctors knew what people were overdosing on because there weren\u2019t as many options. But these days they are flying blind.\nThe executive director of Unharm, Will Tregoning, is optimistic momentum for pill testing is building and it will be harder and harder for authorities to continue to drag their heels.\n\u201cMartin Foley\u2019s comment was essentially a go-away-I\u2019m-on-holidays-type comment. I am not unhopeful about this current Victorian Labor government being able to see the benefits,\u201d he said.\nThe ACT last year became the first jurisdiction to trial pill testing at the Groovin the Moo festival and organisers said it was a huge success and should be rolled out nationally.\nWhile the Australian Bureau of Statistics counts drug-related deaths, it does not give a breakdown on those that happen at music festivals. Some medical professionals estimate there could be three deaths a year on average.\nAn ABC Triple J survey of 11,000 young people found 83% would use pill testing if it was available and and 55% have taken drugs into a festival.",

        "content": "Public Health England aims to persuade parents to reduce sugar in children\u2019s diets\nThe average 10-year-old has consumed as much sugar in their lifetime as the recommended limit for an 18-year-old, according to Public Health England (PHE), which is warning of serious implications for obesity and health.\nChildren are consuming the equivalent of eight excess sugar cubes a day, or 2,800 a year, says PHE, which has launched a new healthy eating campaign under its Change4Life scheme. National guidance recommends no more than five or six sugar cubes (20g-24g) a day for children aged four to 10.\nOne-third of children are overweight or obese at the age of 10 and 4.2% are severely obese in year six at school. Obese children often become obese adults, at risk of heart attacks, strokes and type 2 diabetes.\nThe healthy eating campaign will urge parents to cut the amount of sugar in their families\u2019 diet by switching to lower-sugar drinks, cereals and yoghurts. PHE attempts to persuade the food industry to reformulate the products available in supermarkets have had limited success.\nThe organisation had called for a 20% reduction in sugar content by 2020, and a 5% cut in the first year, ending April 2018, but a report in May said manufacturers and supermarkets had managed only 2%. Yoghurts, breakfast cereals and sweet spreads were the only food groups to achieve a 5% reduction.\nThe campaign emphasises breakfast cereals and yoghurts, together with sugary drinks, where reformulation is happening because of the sugar tax. But not all products in those categories have had their sugar content lowered.\nPHE wants families to switch to those that have, and it rewarded some of the companies that have made significant sugar cuts with a mention. Nestl\u00e9 Shredded Wheat, Nestl\u00e9 Low Sugar Oat Cheerios, Petits Filous and Soreen malt loaf are some of the brands that will carry a Change4Life \u201cgood choice\u201d badge in shops.\n\u201cChildren are consuming too much sugar, but parents can take action now to prevent this building up over the years,\u201d said Dr Alison Tedstone, PHE\u2019s chief nutritionist. \u201cTo make this easier for busy families, Change4Life is offering a straightforward solution \u2013 by making simple swaps each day, children can have healthier versions of everyday foods and drinks, while significantly reducing their sugar intake.\u201d\nThe Obesity Health Alliance, an umbrella group that includes charities and medical organisations, said more urgent action than messages on swapping high-sugar foods for low-sugar alternatives was needed.\n\u201cToday\u2019s children are growing up in obesogenic environments, bombarded by adverts and promotions for junk food online, on TV and in our supermarkets,\u201d said Caroline Cerny, the alliance lead.\n\u201cGovernment proposals to restrict junk-food marketing, tackle price- and place-based promotions and ensure calorie labelling in cafes and restaurants will, if fully implemented, make progress towards reversing our current worrying obesity trends. But the food industry must also do their bit, cutting sugar levels from their products in line with government\u2019s reformulation programme. It is only through concerted action at all levels that we can ensure a healthier future for this country\u2019s children.\u201d\nPHE wants families to choose lower-sugar yoghurts (cutting six cubes to three), swap sugary drinks for no added-sugar drinks (two cubes to half a cube) and frosted or chocolate cereal for something lower in sugar (three cubes to half a cube per bowl). This could cut a child\u2019s sugar intake by 2,500 cubes a year, it says.\nSwapping chocolate, puddings, sweets, cakes and pastries for healthier options such as malt loaf, sugar-free jellies, lower-sugar custards and rice puddings would reduce their intake further, the organisation says.\nKawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cEncouraging parents to halve their children\u2019s sugar intake from everyday food and drink products is applaudable and we fully support the campaign.\n\u201cHowever, if we are to curb the UK\u2019s escalating childhood obesity epidemic then the government must enforce more hard-hitting tactics such as mandatory uniform coloured coded labelling on front of packs, product reformulation with a 50% reduction in sugar across all products, a tax on confectionery and ensure that only healthy products are marketed and advertised.\u201d",

        "content": "There\u2019s a quixotic feel to Tim Paine\u2019s task in 2019, both this week and throughout the year with the away Ashes series but three Tests into the future for his side. On the available evidence, to hold the urn aloft at The Oval in September looks every bit The Impossible Dream, but that doesn\u2019t mean the captain is not aware of what he has to start working towards. With valour, Australia\u2019s knight-errant must travel and serve, however fraught the path ahead.\nHow the selectors have gone about picking the XI for this Sydney Test highlights this difficulty. \u201cTeam balance\u201d has been Paine\u2019s key phrase since Australia\u2019s dispiriting defeat at Melbourne, stating that they are picking the team to win this week \u2013 simple as that. In keeping with that sentiment, Paine noted that one of the most important things he has learned as national skipper is staying present in each moment and each match. \u201cTrying not to be too distracted by what\u2019s ahead of us or who\u2019s coming back or who\u2019s not,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo keep a little bit of reality around our group, to keep our feet where they are and keep trying to improve. That\u2019s been my focus.\u201d\nBut there is a natural tension between honouring that goal and setting a semi-credible Ashes tilt. \u201cGood question,\u201d Paine said when this conundrum was put to him in his pre-match press conference. \u201cObviously we want to pick the best XI that we think can win this Test but at the same time you\u2019re trying to look forward a little bit and make sure you have the right guys around the squad and in our group who we think can be successful across different conditions in Test cricket.\u201d He added: \u201cI know that I\u2019ve probably answered it in two different ways and a lot of people who are critical of selection processes won\u2019t like that, but they\u2019re just the plain facts. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d\nThis is brought into focus with opener Aaron Finch, who could easily be a middle-order batsman by tomorrow but will be up against it for a spot in England tour where the Dukes ball will be hooping. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to changing it a little bit,\u201d Paine replied when asked if he could be shuffling down. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be changing too much. We want to try and settle guys who we think will play long-term in their positions looking forward into the next series and then into the Ashes, we want to settle guys in their positions so as little a disruption as we can have to that or the better in that sense, but at the same time we\u2019ve got to find the best XI to win this Test as well. It\u2019s a bit of a balancing act.\u201d\nIf Finch does drop down or drop out, Usman Khawaja will return to the top of the list. As the Queensland captain has said consistently this summer, he is equally relaxed starting the innings or coming in at the loss of the first wicket having made two career-defining centuries as an opener when circumstances demanded it, averaging in excess of 100 in the spot.\nFor Paine, that might require stepping up too. Could it be that he leads the side, keeps wicket for sessions on end then walks out to bat at No 3? Don\u2019t rule it out. \u201cI\u2019ve had some discussions around that,\u201d he said of a potential batting promotion. \u201cIt may happen it may not, but I certainly haven\u2019t been setting the world on fire, I need to cash in on my starts as well.\u201d\nAt six, Marnus Labuschagne is set to make his return having lost his spot after two busy Tests against Pakistan in the UAE. Paine likes the Queenslander\u2019s versatility on the field and vitality around the group. \u201cAt the end of a long series his energy has been great the last few days,\u201d he said. \u201cHis leg spin\u2019s improved out of sight, and you\u2019re almost leaning towards him at Test level now as a bit of an all-round option.\u201d\nThe prospect of a turning Sydney track increases the chances that Pete Handscomb will also be recalled after missing out in Melbourne for Mitchell Marsh. \u201cWe think it will spin here so if India were to play two spinners Pete can be a really important player for us. He\u2019s an excellent player of spin, and contributes a lot tot the group. And like Marnus he\u2019s a very good package and person to have around the team.\u201d The unlucky man in that formulation would be the younger Marsh, who made a century on the SCG last year but has battled since his elevation to vice-captain.\nWhat Paine is most mindful of this week is that his batsman need to develop the skills required to convert their starts into Test centuries, having posted just one \u2013 Khawaja in Dubai \u2013 since the last time they played at this ground. With just three opportunities left this summer before an Edgbaston inquisition courtesy of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in August, there is an urgency around this point. \u201cWe are constantly a work in progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last Test while out batters didn\u2019t set the world on fire most guys got a start and showed that they can succeed at this level, so this Test there is going to be a real focus from our batting group. We know we are not going to win too many Test matches without scoring hundreds.\u201d\nFor India\u2019s part, the side that they will field in their push to claim a maiden series win in this country is even more mysterious. Ravichandran Ashwin, the visitors\u2019 main tweaker, was ruled out due to a side strain injury when Virat Kohli addressed the media. However, two hours later he was named in the provisional squad of 13 by team management. Equally odd was that Ishant Sharma, the veteran attack leader, was left out of the list, as was seaming all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who looked a lock to play if India opt for two spinners as expected. Misinformation or confusion? Time will tell.\nWhat Paine would give for the chance to lead a world-beating team with the depth of Kohli\u2019s right now. In truth, he may never get the chance during his tenure. But one thing is certain: the service he will provide to his country will be no less committed or determined than the gentleman from La Mancha.",

Inter are supposedly among a throng of Serie A clubs battling it for the signature of the full-back, who is out of contract this summer.\nIf that does not get the pulses racing, then how about this? Another England old boy, Gary Cahill, is so desperate for a loan move away from Chelsea that he has hired a personal trainer to help get into peak condition. Fulham are determined to smooth over the edges of a six-month loan move, while Arsenal are said to be monitoring the defender\u2019s situation. Arsenal are light on numbers, with injuries and suspensions totting up, though Unai Emery is not expected to recall Reiss Nelson or Calum Chambers from their respective season-long stints at Hoffenheim and Fulham.\nChelsea will be fighting off interest left, right and centre this window. Not only is Callum Hudson-Odoi attracting admiring glances from the Bundesliga and Ruben Loftus-Cheek from Premier League rivals, but Tammy Abraham\u2019s Midas touch in the Championship has got the juices of various chief executives flowing across the country. Wolves, Burnley and Huddersfield are all keen on making a move for the young striker, who has scored 16 goals on loan at Aston Villa this season. Villa, meanwhile, are closing on a \u00a32m deal for Wolves centre-back Kortney Hause.\nAfter already snapping up Samir Nasri on a free, West Ham have the appetite for more moves and fancy James McCarthy from Everton. The 28-year-old midfielder is out-of-favour under Marco Silva and could depart on loan. Elsewhere, Thierry Henry wants to sign his former Arsenal teammate Cesc F\u00e0bregas with Monaco confident of sealing a deal for the Spanish midfielder, while Tottenham are willing to flog Georges-K\u00e9vin Nkoudou on loan and Southampton have given Steven Davis the green light to return to Rangers.",

        "content": "With Ireland threatening New Zealand and a host of new head coaches on the way, 2019 feels a watershed like no other\nWorld Cups always feel like watersheds. Eddie Jones has reminded us often enough that everything else is just sparring; that all that matters is the date of the final \u2013 2 November \u2013 and ensuring England are at their peak when the latest four-year cycle comes to an end. Except 2019 seems different, not least because there is so much uncertainty as to what will come next. Put simply, no one really knows what the international landscape beyond Japan 2019 will look like and that only adds to the intrigue.\nThere is plenty of intrigue already surrounding the first World Cup to be staged in Asia, away from the sport\u2019s traditional strongholds. Throw in the fact that Ireland have mounted a genuine challenge to New Zealand, the creeping sense that the balance of power is shifting from south to north and the narrative of Jones\u2019s return to Japan \u2013 sure to follow England\u2019s campaign every step of the way \u2013 and it is quite the melting pot.\nIf it is too strong to say a new world order was established last year, it was certainly shaken. Consider that there were no northern hemisphere teams involved in the final two weeks of the 2015 World Cup and then that three of the top four positions in the world rankings are currently occupied by Ireland, Wales and England.\nNew Zealand remain the team to beat but there was a wobble towards the end of 2018, raising questions as to whether the All Blacks are in decline, or at least approaching that stage. Which brings us back to the rugby landscape post-2019 and all its uncertainty. Four of the top six teams in the world will have a new head coach \u2013 including New Zealand \u2013 and there is a fair chance England and Australia will join them. The San Francisco agreement \u2013 hammered out in January last year \u2013 is due to begin in 2020 but precisely what the longer-term global calendar will look like remains unclear as talk of a World League continues.\nThe argument in favour of it is financial, a response to the centralisation of power in the hands of the Premiership and French clubs. For it is naive to think that the rise in player salaries is going to slow down, as much as the Premiership claims its \u00a3230m windfall will not go on wages, and that will only weaken the southern hemisphere nations. The most fascinating subplot of the World Cup is whether New Zealand, South Africa and Australia can still prevail over market forces. Even if they do you wonder if they are just holding back the tide.\nBut if there is uncertainty as to what will happen on the field, it is matched by the sense of a step into the unknown off it. The tournament\u2019s director, Alan Gilpin, has described this year\u2019s World Cup as the most challenging and it is easy to see why. To put it mildly the climate in Japan in September is changeable and the threat of earthquakes is only too apparent, not to mention that of typhoons that would also cause major disruption. There are a number of cultural differences too for players, coaches and spectators to overcome, including the need for tattoos to be covered up in public swimming pools and baths.\n \nWhen is it happening?The action kicks off on 20 September with the hosts, Japan, taking on surprise package Russia in Tokyo. The holders, New Zealand, begin their campaign against their main pool rivals South Africa the following day while England\u2019s first match is against Tonga on 22 September in Sapporo. The final takes place on 2 November at the 72,327-capacity International Stadium in Yokohoma.\nWhat is the format?There are four pools of five teams with the top two advancing to the quarter-finals:Pool A: Ireland, Scotland, Japan, Russia, SamoaPool B: New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, Namibia, Canada\u00a0Pool C: England, France, Argentina, USA, TongaPool D: Australia, Wales, Georgia, Fiji, Uruguay\nHow do you get a seat?Tickets went on general sale on first-come, first-served basis on 19 January via www.rugbyworldcup.com/tickets. There are 1.8m tickets available across the tournament and so far more than 4.5m applications for tickets have been received via the respective ballot phases, making Japan 2019 the most popular Rugby World Cup to date. Japan, England, Ireland and New Zealand matches are in most demand.\nA limited number of tickets are currently available via the general ticket sales phase.\nThere are also official supporter tour and hospitality options available for fans around the world \u2013 see www.rugbyworldcup.com/supportertours and www.rugbyworldcup.com/hospitality. Overall, 400,000 international visitors are anticipated over the six-week period, delivering a record economic impact for an event in Japan, and a Rugby World Cup, of \u00a32.97bn.\nInfrastructure is no longer the problem it once was and while Gilpin, concerned by the lack of progress with training facilities, was forced to give the organising committee a few reminders in late 2017, he is satisfied they are again on track. Problems with the host venues have been surpassed too, after the final was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama because the showpiece new stadium would not be ready in time. Instead it will be opened for the 2020 Olympics, which has the potential to act as either a distraction or added motivation to impress.\nMeanwhile, ticket sales are always a concern when major events enter new territory and the worry is that there will be plenty of empty seats at the less glamorous fixtures, hence the drive to encourage the 400,000-plus visitors to mix tourist pursuits with matches \u2013 come for rugby, stay for the ryokan. \u201cWe like to think of it as the most challenging because of the extent of the opportunity it gives us,\u201d said Gilpin. \u201cGoing somewhere as different in rugby terms as Japan, using this as we are trying to grow rugby in Asia, creates challenges we have not faced before.\u201d\nMuch will depend on the success of the host nation and ultimately the Japanese public loves to get behind a winner. Women\u2019s football briefly soared in popularity when Japan won the World Cup in 2011 and success this year \u2013 which would mean getting out of their pool \u2013 would eclipse the feat of 2015, in which Jones masterminded the victory over South Africa.\nHis homecoming certainly helps in building the profile of the tournament too, but what of his England side\u2019s chances of success? Jones\u2019s familiarity with the host nation is an advantage but it cannot be ignored that despite all his efforts, he has failed to arrange a trip for his players to acclimatise, even if he and his coaches have been on countless recces.\nIt is significant because practically all of England\u2019s rivals will have had some experience before the tournament starts but his players will be in uncharted territory. As with so much else, uncertainty abounds.",

        "content": "October\u2019s parliamentary elections may hinge on the recent pipeline nationalisation and the government\u2019s carbon tax plan\nIn his four years leading Canada, the Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has gone to great lengths \u2013 at home and abroad \u2013 to bolster his environmental credentials. Now, with a federal election looming, he is gambling his parliamentary majority and political future on them.\nWhen Canadians cast their votes next October, they will do so amid standard electoral issues: jobs, the economy and foreign policy. But in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, a pair of politically fractious additions have risen to the top: carbon taxes and pipelines.\n\u201cThe good news for the prime minister is that when you ask Canadians who they think would make the best prime minister, he still has a comfortable advantage over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer,\u201d said Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster. \u201cThe bad news is that leading up to the next federal election right now, it\u2019s basically a coin toss between the Liberals and Conservatives.\u201d\nCanadians have shown an increasing concern for the environment, but in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, the results are often messy.\nEarlier in the year, as part of its pan-Canadian climate change strategy, the federal government required all provinces have a minimum level of carbon pricing. For those that fail to do so, the government will implement its own carbon tax, set to begin in July 2019. Already, the levy has fired up Trudeau\u2019s political opponents \u2013 at both the provincial and federal level.\nBut the prime minister had been forced to fend off barbs from critics \u2013 including the left-of-centre New Democratic party and Indigenous communities, that any environmental goodwill he might have earned through his carbon tax has been sullied by the support for \u2013 and subsequent nationalisation of \u2013 an oil pipeline. \u201cThe only true test of a climate change plan, after all, is whether carbon is going up or down,\u201d said the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, in a statement about his frustrations with the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs from Alberta to the British Columbia coast.\nThe result for Trudeau is a tricky path forward as he heads off attacks that he has done too little on the environment \u2013 or too much.\n\u201cTrudeau has moved from having an environment that was friendly and pliant to one that is more combative and hostile,\u201d said Nanos, pointing to a string of shifts to Conservative \u2013 or right-of-centre \u2013 provincial governments across the country since Trudeau was elected in 2015. Doug Ford, Ontario\u2019s premier, has repeatedly called carbon pricing \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d and at least five provinces have banded together to fight the tax in the courts, a battle legal experts believe they will lose.\nAlong with their provincial counterparts, the federal Conservatives have pledged to repeal any carbon taxes, with Scheer dismissing the policy as an \u201celection gimmick\u201d. This fight comes amid reports that Canada is not on pace to meet its 2030 climate goals.\n\u201cThe opposition or the politicians will convince people that the carbon price is hurting them, even though that\u2019s a lie,\u201d said Mark Jaccard, professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University.\nJaccard, who has also served as a policy analyst, has previously warned respective governments that carbon taxes \u2013 while effective at reducing emissions \u2013 are politically difficult to sell and often not as effective as other policy options. He points out that the biggest emissions reductions in Canada came from the Ontario government\u2019s closure of coal plants. The recent plan to close all of Canada\u2019s coal plants by 2029 will have a far greater impact than a carbon tax \u2013 yet the tax will probably remain at the centre of the discussion.\nThe tax could end up being particularly appealing from an electoral standpoint, said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. All proceeds from the levy will be remitted back to households in the form of a cheque, the first of which will arrive in July \u2013 a date Wiseman suspects will be close enough to the election that people will take notice.\nBut Wiseman, who has studied the country\u2019s elections for generations, cautions: \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way off. And things can change on a dime in politics.\u201d",

        "content": "If you insist on starting each new year with a sense of childlike wonderment, you will be stunned by news that Russia has missed the New Year\u2019s Eve deadline to allow the World Anti-Doping Agency access to the Moscow lab at the heart of its massive state-sponsored doping programme.\nThis development is also incredible to wide-eyed Wada president Craig Reedie, who professes himself \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d, while the head of Usada, Travis Tygart, brands the situation \u201ca total joke\u201d. The latter verdict seems the more realistic. Back in November, Sir Craig justified his recommendation that Russia be readmitted to international competition, despite it having not met his organisation\u2019s own conditions for that to happen. \u201cI find it very hard to believe,\u201d he found it very hard to believe, \u201cthat the guarantees, made to us by the Russian authorities, that they won\u2019t deliver.\u201d\nYes, well. BELIEVE THE MAGIC, BUDDY. In a clear provocation to writers who prefer to fall back on at least one Princess Bride reference per column (ie me) Craig went on to say that the idea of Russia missing this deadline was \u201cinconceivable\u201d. Inconceivable! As Inigo Montoya is forced to remark in that movie: \u201cYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\u201d And here we are. I can\u2019t believe that former 1960s badminton starlet Craig Reedie has had his arse handed to him yet again by former KGB colonel Vladimir Putin. Honestly, what are the chances? Also, how many arses does Craig have? At this rate he is surely down to the one he talks out of every time he makes a decision in the interests of a non-compliant, provenly dirty country as opposed to the clean and compliant athletes who should be his absolute priority.\nBefore we go on, a reminder of the background. In 2016, Russia was found to have operated the biggest sports cheating programme of the 21st century. A German TV investigation claimed that up to 99% of Russian athletes were doping; subsequent individual bans revealed that even curlers and visually impaired Paralympians were at it. Russia was finally kicked out of the Winter Olympics in late 2017, and embarked upon a profound exercise in self-reflection and soul-searching. I\u2019m kidding, of course. It cocked an eyebrow and settled in for a short wait.\nKeen to sink to its expectations, Wada took 10 months to recommend Russian readmission, despite the country having not complied with two of the crucial recommendations of the McLaren report: one, to even admit a state-sponsored doping programme had existed, and two, to grant Wada access to its Moscow lab. So you could argue that compliance of one sort had technically occurred \u2013 Wada had complied with Russia, as opposed to the other way round.\nAlas, this wasn\u2019t the glass-half-full take adopted by outraged athletes. Former cross-country skier Beckie Scott resigned as chair of Wada\u2019s athlete committee in protest, while last October Reedie was pointedly not invited to a White House summit dedicated to reforming his organisation. Still, with the deadline clock ticking, everyone mostly had to wait. The next Wada meeting, at which any penalty on Russia could be enforced, is scheduled for 14 January.\nAnd so to last week\u2019s not-entirely-sensational plot twist. Wada pitched up as billed in Moscow, only to be told its equipment was not authorised. Yup, the old \u201cwrong equipment\u201d gambit. Russia would love to help \u2013 it really would \u2013 but despite having made no equipment stipulations before the visit, things had now apparently become a problem.\nSo what now? The new expectation, apparently, is that Russia will allow some sort of access in the 11th hour, outside the deadline but just before the 14 January meeting. This is surely taking the piss. Indeed, there is a neat irony to the fact that this all began with Russia literally taking the piss \u2013 passing tainted urine samples through a hole in the lab wall in exchange for clean ones.\nFurthermore, as most people know, the thing about the other sort of drug users is that you can\u2019t keep enabling them. Their compulsion forces them to become very good liars, and they tell you they\u2019ll change as a way of prolonging their refusal to do so. The accepted wisdom is that they really need to hit rock bottom \u2013 diving down filthy bogs in search of suppositories; licking novichok off doorknobs \u2013 before you can actually believe them. Without wishing to venture too far out on a limb, I don\u2019t think Russia has reached its personal rock bottom just yet. Everything it has done thus far has been the equivalent of a celebrity\u2019s tactical visit to an Arizona rehab called something like Cloudwinds. It reeks of defensive action mandated by your agent.\nAny reputation Sir Craig Reedie\u2019s Wada has left \u2013 and for me it exists in entirely undetectable traces \u2013 will be gone if this missed deadline is excused. Reedie\u2019s frequent refrain is that the athletes don\u2019t understand the method to his apparent madness. On the contrary, they understand it very well. It is one rule for them, and another for a corrupt state. If this wasn\u2019t made clear when the tainted Winter Olympics in Sochi were used as a curtain-raiser for Putin\u2019s invasion of Crimea, it certainly has been ever since.\nOn a positive note, the increasingly vocal protestations of athletes last year \u2013 from those calling time-up on Wada to the remarkable survivors\u2019 testimonies of Larry Nassar\u2019s USA gymnast victims \u2013 suggest they are more than aware that sport is mostly run for countries and administrators, and not for them. I can only wish an increasingly powerful 2019 to the talent, and a year of greater reckoning for those who leech off it.",

The criticism was echoed by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who called the comments \u201ca disgrace\u201d.Speaking on a visit to Dover, Javid questioned why people making the journey had not sought asylum in the first safe country they entered.\n\u201cA question has to be asked: if you are a genuine asylum seeker why have you not sought asylum in the first safe country that you arrived in?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause France is not a country where anyone would argue it is not safe in any way whatsoever, and if you are genuine then why not seek asylum in your first safe country?\u201d\n\u201cAlso, if you do somehow make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure that you are often not successful because we need to break that link, and to break that link means we can save more lives,\u201d he added.\nColin Yeo, a leading immigration and asylum barrister at Garden Court chambers, said the home secretary\u2019s apparent threat was illegal. \u201cSending genuine refugees to face persecution in order to dissuade others from seeking to come here is plainly illegal,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\u201cI imagine the home secretary knows this, but if so it is depressing that he is still saying it as a way of trying to make himself sound tough. The latest asylum statistics show that around three-quarters of Iranian asylum claims succeed, so we are talking here about genuine refugees.\u201d\nDr Lisa Doyle, director of advocacy at the Refugee Council, said it would be unlawful for the UK to deny someone asylum as a way of deterring others from making a claim.\n\u201cThe 1951 refugee convention acknowledges that refugees may enter countries through irregular routes and should not be penalised for this,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe outcome of an asylum application cannot be pre-judged, irrespective of how that person reached the country. It\u2019s a shame that the home secretary seems to need reminding that seeking asylum is a right and the UK has an obligation to assess claims fairly and grant protection to those who need it.\u201d\nAbbott said that the comments were part of a Conservative \u201cobsession with maintaining a hostile environment\u201d for refugees and migrants. \u201cSuggesting that the British government would deny legitimate asylum claims is not only a disgrace but a breach of the 1951 refugee convention,\u201d she said.\nYvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee, also said the comments were unwise. \u201cAsylum claims have to be determined according to the law and the circumstances of every individual case, not as an arbitrary political decision supposedly to deter others,\u201d she said. \u201cThe home secretary knows this so to suggest otherwise is completely wrong.\u201d\nIn recent days, Javid has also been criticised after he repeatedly referred to people making the Channel crossing as \u201cillegal\u201d migrants, though it is not against the law to seek asylum.\nEarlier this week, Javid told Sky News: \u201cOur job here is to make sure this doesn\u2019t turn into a new route for ever-increased illegal migration, so I want to stop it now as much as I possibly can.\u201d Asked about his use of the term \u201cillegal migration\u201d, Javid skirted the question.\nPaul Hook, the head of campaigns at Refugee Action, said the home secretary\u2019s words needed to be more compassionate.\n\u201cThese are people first and foremost and they deserve a humanitarian response,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope the home secretary will demonstrate that in his words and actions in the coming days and weeks.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Javid said 539 people had made the crossing in 2018, though 80% had been in the last three months of the year. In \u201calmost every case\u201d they went on to seek asylum, he said.\nJavid said the government was doing everything it could to ensure boats found crossing the Channel were returned to France but acknowledged if Border Force vessels picked up people in UK waters, they would be taken to a port in the UK.\nThe UK announced earlier this week it would deploy two extra Border Force ships to the Channel to try to disrupt the crossings in small and often unseaworthy boats across one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.\nThe numbers crossing the Channel are still small. About 100 have made the crossing since Christmas Day, though Javid cut short a family holiday and designated the increase in the number of crossings a \u201cmajor incident\u201d.\nThe home secretary said two Border Force cutters would be redeployed as part of wider efforts to ensure the route did not become more popular and said it was a priority to prevent deaths.\nOn Monday, a group of 12 Iranians, including a 10-year-old child, were interviewed by immigration officials after they came ashore near Lydd-on-Sea, in Kent. Six Iranian men were also found on a beach near Deal in Kent on Sunday morning.\nThe Red Cross, which provides refugee support services across Kent including food parcels and clothing, said Iranian asylum seekers were often some of the most destitute.\nIranians have made up the highest number of asylum applications to the UK every year for the past three years, although numbers have fallen, according to Home Office figures.\nThe majority of Iranian asylum seekers were successful. In 2017, 45% were given asylum in their first application and almost half of those who appealed against a refusal decision were also allowed to remain.",

        "content": "The TV presenter and actor replaced veteran host Stephen Fry in 2018 \nWhen are the Baftas? \nThis year's Baftas take place on 10 February 2019. The ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Joanna Lumley and broadcast \u2013 about 90 minutes after it actually happens \u2013 on BBC ONE.\nWho votes for the Baftas?\nThe Baftas are voted for by around 6,500 members of the British Film and Television Academy. These are industry workers who have to apply for membership \u2013 and pay an annual subscription of \u00a3450. Each category in the shortlists is decided by a chapter of around 100 specialists in that area. Once the shortlists are announced, all voters can have their say. If they haven't seen a particular film, they are supposed to abstain from voting in that category \u2013 but this is unenforced.\u00a0\nWhy do they matter? \nThe Baftas matter on their own terms, third only to the Golden Globes and the Oscars as prestige gongs. A Bafta win adds critical kudos \u2013 and, hopefully, box office \u2013 to a film, as well as credibility to an individual's career. They also matter because of their proximity to the Oscars. Until 2001, the Baftas took place in April or May, but since the move to about a fortnight before the Academy Awards, their importance increased. This is because voting for the Oscars closes a few days after the Baftas, meaning it's the final chance for candidates to impress with their speeches - or for Oscar voters to seek to redress apparent miscarriages of justice. The Bafta and Oscar voting bases overlap considerably, too: around 500 people are thought to vote for both.\u00a0\nSo do the big winners generally mirror each other?\nNot necessarily. A recent survey found the Baftas were only the fourth best Oscars bellwether \u2013 after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards. Since 2001, they've predicted the best picture winner eight times out of a possible 17, diverging the past four years running, opting for Three Billboards over The Shape of Water, La La Land over Moonlight, The Revenant\u00a0over Spotlight and\u00a0Boyhood\u00a0over Birdman. Their form is stronger when it comes to the acting categories, though they do consistently favour homegrown talent.\u00a0\nWhat do winners actually get? \nA big bronze mask on a marble base, which Bafta reserves the right to buy back for \u00a31 should the recipient give it to anyone other than their children. Plus a certificate, with which the winner can do what they like.\nJoanna Lumley will return as host of the British Academy film awards on 10 February.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Joanna has agreed to return as our host for a second year,\u201d said Emma Baehr, Bafta\u2019s director of awards. \u201cShe was fantastic and we\u2019re looking forward to the ceremony with her once again at the helm.\u201d\nThe TV presenter and star of Absolutely Fabulous took over last year from Stephen Fry, though her turn at the podium was met with mixed reviews. Although the choice of a female host was applauded, many felt the script and jokes could have done with more polish.\nThe Bafta rising star nominations are announced on 3 January, with the full nominations disclosed on 9 January. The Golden Globe awards \u2013 hosted by Sandra Oh and Adam Samberg \u2013 take place on 6 January.\nIt is yet to be announced who will host the Oscars ceremony \u2013 which takes place two weeks after the Baftas \u2013 following the departure of Kevin Hart after his history of homophobic remarks came to light.\nThere has been speculation that the organisers of the Academy Awards may dispense with a single emcee entirely this year, instead opting for \u201ca bunch of huge celebs, something SNL style, and buzzy people\u201d.",

        "content": "Fuelled by passion and outrage, the playwright and director is shaking up theatre with works about Windrush to an all-women-of-colour Richard II \u2013 and now she\u2019s taking over the Bush in London\nLynette Linton is known for her deep love of Michael Jackson. The director and playwright has said that, in a parallel universe, her ideal job would be the King of Pop\u2019s backup dancer. When I ask her why she loves him so much, she replies as though the answer is obvious. Jackson, she says, was a theatremaker. \u201cIf you watch his performances, that\u2019s a show, it\u2019s an experience. Everything from his toe to his eyebrow was activated, and you want your audiences to faint like they did when they saw him.\u201d Does she want the audience for Sweat, her current production at the Donmar Warehouse in London, to faint in the aisles? Linton laughs, and points out that Sweat\u2019s playwright, Lynn Nottage, has signed on to write the book for a forthcoming Broadway musical about Jackson. Everything, it seems, is connected.\nTo many in British theatre, Linton is one of the industry\u2019s friendliest and most exciting figures. As an assistant director she has worked with Kwame Kwei-Armah and Michael Grandage; she has been an associate director of the Gate in Notting Hill, and she has written for both Theatre Royal Stratford East and the Arcola in east London, her plays exploring mixed-race identity (2017\u2019s Hashtag Lightie), queerness (2013\u2019s Step) and inner-city London\u2019s chicken shops (2015\u2019s Chicken Palace).\nThe recent announcement that Linton will take over from Madani Younis as the artistic director of the Bush theatre in west London has raised the 28-year-old\u2019s profile to new heights. When she starts this month, she will become one of the few black women running an arts organisation \u2013 let alone a building \u2013 in the UK. After a year in which record numbers have come through the theatre\u2019s doors and Arinze Kene\u2019s gig theatre show Misty transferred to the West End, the task of taking over could look daunting. But before she gets truly stuck in at the Bush, Linton has a lot to do.\nIn February, she will co-direct a company of women of colour in Richard II at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, alongside actor and \u201cmentor, friend, auntie, sister, everything\u201d Adjoa Andoh. Later in the year, Linton and her production company Black Apron Entertainment \u2013 named after the uniform she and her collaborators Daniel Bailey and Gino Green would wear in their old jobs at John Lewis \u2013 will curate a series of films for the Royal Court in response to the Windrush scandal. And Linton is in the midst of her largest directing role to date, Nottage\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning Sweat.\nIt is, Linton says, is \u201ca beautiful story\u201d, filled with \u201cracial, class, gender, youth tensions \u2026 you can break it down on so many levels. Lynn\u2019s writing is so nuanced \u2026 I think it does what theatre should do, which is take you somewhere that you might not have seen before, and really understand who these people are.\u201d\nLinton says she has had \u201cthe time of her life\u201d working with the company, and her actors appear equally enthused. Their social media accounts show videos of them all dancing to Lauryn Hill and A Tribe Called Quest. It\u2019s a pre-rehearsal tradition, she says with a smile, that she \u201cstole\u201d from Kwei-Armah.\nDirecting is currently her focus, but Linton considers herself equally a playwright, saying that as a child she \u201cwas always writing. I read Malorie Blackman and wanted to be her.\u201d\nAfter graduating in English from the University of Sussex, she met the actor, writer and director Rikki Beadle-Blair through the National Youth Theatre. Beadle-Blair, Linton says, \u201cchanged my life. He just went, \u2018You\u2019re a writer?\u2019 I said yeah, and he said, \u2018Have you written a play?\u2019 I said no, just really, really long novels that no one\u2019s ever seen. Then I wrote my first play for him.\u201d Step, a James Baldwin-inspired story about a young man grappling with his sexuality that Beadle-Blair programmed at Theatre Royal Stratford East, was a gateway into theatre not only for Linton, but also for many of the people around her.\n\u201cA lot of my friends would be like, \u2018Why are you writing a play? Who\u2019s gonna watch that?\u2019 Then the first time they went to the theatre was to watch my show, which was full of slang, and from the ends. I know it sounds simplistic, but I could see them go ...\u201d She opens her eyes wide, and spreads her hands. \u201cThe same thing happened with Chicken Palace. I remember [getting] a text saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t know theatre could do that, I didn\u2019t know theatre was for me.\u2019 That\u2019s when I just went OK, cool, I need to be reaching to 15-year-old Lynette, and going: \u2018You can come in here. This is for you.\u2019\u201d\nMuch of Linton\u2019s work has touched on who she is and where she comes from, with her forthcoming Windrush films a tribute to her mixed British Caribbean heritage. \u201cMy dad is from Guyana, and he sat me and my brother down [as children] and was like, \u2018You are black, the world will see you as black.\u2019\u201d The Windrush scandal is something that has affected her deeply. \u201cI spoke to theatre people, saying, \u2018Why are we not responding to this? Why are we not in the streets marching?\u2019 They\u2019re sending families home. It makes me feel sick.\u201d Linton\u2019s voice shakes a little. \u201cEven now, it chokes me. The people they\u2019re targeting are elders, man. People are having heart attacks and have died because of this.\u201d Still, her films \u2013 which are to be screened at the Royal Court in London \u2013 will have \u201ca massive celebration at the core. It was really important to me that we took over a building and celebrated West Indian culture.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest departure for Linton, who has worked almost exclusively in new writing, will be co-directing Richard II at the Globe in February. \u201cI wanted to do Shakespeare because I\u2019m scared of Shakespeare. I was an English student, so I love studying the words on the page, but watching it? I\u2019ve always felt Shakespeare is not for me.\u201d There\u2019s a hope her Richard II will reach out to diverse audiences but also highlight a diversity of talent behind the scenes. Both the cast and crew are all women of colour, a deliberate move. \u201cThere are incredible women of colour stage managers, choreographers, fight directors, designers, photographers, [and] we\u2019ve got them all. But also it\u2019s like someone tweeted about Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 if she can find 50 black women violinists, why can\u2019t everyone? We\u2019re chatting and chatting, but nothing\u2019s happening.\u201d She pauses, corrects herself. \u201cThings are happening! But not fast enough.\u201d\nOn the day we meet, Linton has just finished her first full run of Sweat. She has been working flat out. \u201cOn Monday, I was in rehearsal for Sweat, then at lunchtime did a model box for Richard, then went straight back into Sweat, and had to talk about Bush in the evening. My brain is fried.\u201d Currently, she\u2019s feeling \u201cmuch more excited than terrified \u2026 going into that building [the Bush], I\u2019m going to take risks\u201d. Still, her career as a freelance director and writer has been taking off. Why apply to run the Bush?\nShe quotes Baldwin: \u201cThe place in which I\u2019ll fit will not exist until I make it\u201d, a line she keeps on the front of her notepad. \u201cI went for the building because being an artistic director was my end goal. One of the key things about theatre is making sure the building is welcoming, and that starts with the people that are running it. There\u2019s been so many times in the years I\u2019ve been working in this industry, where I\u2019ve walked into a building and gone: \u2018I\u2019m not supposed to be here.\u2019 That starts at the top. And until we\u2019re running the top \u2026\u201d she trails off. Who is we? \u201cI\u2019m talking about people of colour. I\u2019m talking about people from working-class backgrounds. I\u2019m talking about women. I\u2019m talking about myself.\u201d\nSweat is at the Donmar, London, until 26 January. Richard II is at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, London, 22 February-21 April.

Fifteen people are still missing as rescuers continue to scour the ruins of the building in sub-zero temperatures.\nRussia\u2019s Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency that answers to the country\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, said a gas leak was the most likely explanation for the blast, which occurred on the city\u2019s Karl Marx Avenue.\nThe znak.com website cited an unnamed source who said the explosion was a \u201cterrorist act\u201d. The source, whose comments could not be independently verified by the Guardian, said investigators had discovered the blast originated in a second-floor apartment, where an unknown man is suspected to have stored explosives for a planned attack on a local shopping centre.\nThe man is reported to have moved into the apartment, which he was renting, on 30 December. Znak.com is a respected news website which has previously reported on the deaths of Russian military contractors in Syria.\nThe source also said security services had killed \u201cthree terrorists\u201d after opening fire on their vehicle late on Monday. \u201cThey tried to shoot back,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them escaped and is being sought.\u201d\nFootage posted online by passersby showed a Gazelle minivan engulfed in flames and loud bangs that resembled gunshots. The incident took place opposite the city administration building, also located on Karl Marx Avenue, less than two miles from the site of the apartment blast. Investigators would only confirm three people had died when \u201cgas canisters\u201d exploded inside the minivan.\nBoris Dubrovsky, the regional governor, said officers from the FSB security service were at the scene of the minivan blast, but insisted there was no link between the incident and the building explosion.\nThe Investigative Committee said: \u201cIn connection with various reports that have appeared in the media, it must be noted that at the present moment ... no traces of explosives or their components have been found. Work to establish the causes of the tragedy is being conducted around the clock.\u201d\nArmed police with dogs also reportedly evacuated residents of a second tower block in Magnitogorsk late on Monday. Some residents of the building told local media that police said they were looking for a \u201cbomb\u201d.\nThe blasts have rekindled memories of a series of explosions that tore through four residential buildings in Moscow and other Russian cities in 1999, killing more than 300 people.\nCritics accused the Russian security services of carrying out the explosions as part of a plot to ensure Putin, a former FSB chief, would secure the presidency in elections held in March 2000. A number of people from Russia\u2019s North Caucasus region were later jailed over the blasts.",

        "content": "Campaigners vow to join with MPs to force UK government to support end to abortion ban\nWomen\u2019s rights campaigners in Northern Ireland have vowed to join forces with pro-choice activists in the Irish Republic and MPs at Westminster to force the UK government to address the \u201cdenial of human rights\u201d in 2019 by supporting moves to end the region\u2019s abortion ban.\nActivists urged Theresa May\u2019s government not to sacrifice the rights and health of women at the altar of Brexit, and back potential legislation to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland.\nThe region has one of the strictest bans in the world, with women in almost every circumstance facing up to life in prison for a termination. The 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland and an abortion cannot be performed legally even in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities.\nBut after the success of the repeal the eighth amendment campaign in helping to overturn the Republic of Ireland\u2019s near-total ban on abortions in a landslide referendum victory, as well as polls showing strong support for a change north of the border, activists are motivated and energised in a manner not seen in decades, said Emma Campbell, who co-chairs the Alliance for Choice.\n\u201cThe referendum in the south was really helpful, because you can basically no longer argue that the public don\u2019t support a change in the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been a long fight with a lot of setbacks so we are cautiously optimistic, but I would say more optimistic than we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\nIn the Irish Republic, the repeal campaign\u2019s use of online platforms such as In Her Shoes to tell the stories of women forced to travel to other countries for an abortion also had a huge impact, said Campbell. \u201cThe public heard stories of travel that were no different to the stories here. It gave people courage \u2026 it has been such a huge open secret, but once you have broken the silence there is no putting the genie back in the bottle.\u201d\nIn Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist party, which props up May\u2019s government in Westminster, has refused to budge from its hardline support for the region\u2019s Victorian-era abortion law. Sinn F\u00e9in, however, dramatically changed its stance after the referendum in the Irish Republic and backs liberalisation of the law.\nCampaigners have the support of their counterparts in the Irish Republic who were ready to continue the struggle north of the border, said Ailbhe Smyth, a spokeswoman for the Coalition to Repeal the Eighth Amendment. \u201cI think what\u2019s maybe most important is we\u2019ve actually managed it in the south,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had lost that referendum it would have set back that process, but winning it has given them great fire and determination.\u201d\nA number of elements have come together over the past couple of months to add fuel to that fire. In October polling by Amnesty International suggested 65% of adults in Northern Ireland thought abortion should not be a crime.\nA supreme court ruling in June said that the region\u2019s abortion laws were incompatible with human rights legislation. The decision has put further pressure on politicians to act even though the justices declined to issue a final ruling because the case brought before them did not involve an individual victim.\nAnd with the Northern Ireland assembly not sitting since the collapse of the power-sharing government almost two years ago, campaigning MPs in Westminster sense they have an unprecedented opportunity. Last July more than 170 politicians from the UK and the Irish Republic signed a letter urging the UK government to reform Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws.\nThe women and equalities select committee is carrying out an inquiry into those laws, and the minister for women and equalities, Penny Mordaunt, has told Northern Ireland\u2019s politicians that if they did not liberalise the abortion law, Westminster would.\nThank you to all MPs who took part in todays debate.With authority comes responsibility.Message from NI Secretary of State today: NI should take that responsibility.Message from the House of Commons: if you don't, we will.#trustwomen\nSince the referendum, the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has also received letters from anti-abortion campaigners, including people born with serious conditions to maintain restrictions on abortion. One asked Bradley to confirm whether she was a Christian, writing: \u201cIt would seem that the most vulnerable in our society, the unborn child, is not permitted human rights.\u201d\nBut a growing number of MPs support a change in the law, with a number taking direct action. A free vote on a 10-minute rule bill, put forward by Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson, passed 208 votes to 123 with cross-party support, bolstering confidence among campaigners and supportive MPs even if the backbencher bill will not become law because the government has signalled that it will not give it parliamentary time.\n\u201cWe can no longer stand by as women in Northern Ireland have their human rights breached,\u201d Johnson told the Guardian. \u201cIt is quite clear that the Westminster parliament stands ready to deal with this.\u201d\nMany campaigners are now pinning their hopes on moves by her colleague Stella Creasy who, with Labour\u2019s Conor McGinn, successfully tabled an amendment in October forcing Bradley \u201cto issue guidance\u201d on how officials can continue to enforce the region\u2019s abortion law.\nCreasy plans to table an amendment to the government\u2019s long-awaited domestic abuse bill.\n\u201cThe lack of assembly cannot be used as an excuse not to act on this basic human rights issue,\u201d said Creasy. \u201cIn 2019, we will be redoubling our fight against this injustice and seeking to amend legislation to decriminalise abortion across the UK including in Northern Ireland. Whatever deals the PM does with the DUP to stay in power we will not rest until abortion is free, safe, legal and local for every UK citizen.\u201d\nThe situation for the women seeking an abortion was an ongoing tragedy, said Ruairi Rowan, an advocacy manager at the Family Planning Association in Northern Ireland. \u201cPeople are still shocked when they find out that you can go to jail for buying abortion pills, that you can\u2019t get an abortion if you are raped,.\u201d\nA woman faces prison after been embroiled in a legal battle for years after obtaining abortion pills for her underage daughter, who was in an abusive relationship.\nWomen in Northern Ireland will be able to access services in the Irish Republic from this month. However, a three-day waiting period means women in desperate situations are likely to continue to travel to the rest of the UK where they now have access to free abortion services, said Rowan.\nBut campaigners are more determined than ever that 2019 will bring the change they argue Northern Ireland desperately needs, sai Goretti Horgan, an activist. Horgan said it took the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012 after being denied an abortion during a protracted miscarriage to spark a mass movement for change south of the border, she said.\n\u201cMaybe the only way we can break the stalemate is to get tens of thousands on to the streets either here [in Northern Ireland] or london,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope it won\u2019t take another tragic death to make that happen.\u201d",

        "content": "We, as a group of child mental health professionals, academics, campaigners and politicians, agree with the sentiments expressed in your front-page article (Shortage of mental health care is putting children at risk, GPs warn, 31 December).\nThe slogan of requiring \u201ca parity of esteem\u201d between physical and mental health in society, often used by ministers and others, needs to become an urgent future reality if we are to stem the emerging epidemic of mental health problems among young people. Some of us believe it would be wise to redirect 20% of current reactive spending on this area towards focused preventive programmes such as mental health first aid and other evidence-based interventions. We think this would ameliorate the current reliance on clinic-based and psychiatric medication-based interventions and reap rich rewards and results.\nWe support the rapid expansion of proven approaches such as whole-school wellbeing programmes, cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness to tackle underlying anxieties, along with other evidence-based psychological, talking, physical, art and family therapies to identify the mental distress caused possibly by earlier life trauma. Now is the time for our government to show some new year resolve on this issue.Dave Traxson Chair of Calm (Child-friendly Alternatives to Labelling and psychiatric Medications), Professor Peter Kinderman Vice-chair of Calm, and chair of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool\n Your article about failing NHS provision for adolescent mental health made distressingly familiar reading. It will soon be the first anniversary of my son\u2019s exposure to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). He has been on a large dose of antidepressants since January. The medicine\u2019s instructions say it is not to be used on children without talking therapy; he has had only five sessions of talking therapy.\nHe shows some symptoms of depression, his only diagnosis. He has become verbally and physically violent; his schoolwork \u2013 already poor \u2013 went off a cliff, as did attendance. He has started to self-harm. His unsupportive school showed him the door; and in the period of having no school, Camhs offered us no additional support despite pleas to manage a crisis. They also seem unwilling to screen for any other conditions, despite various indications that he has conditions other than depression. Never in my professional or personal life have I encountered a service as abject and incurious as that imposed by Camhs. My beautiful and clever son seems a shell of who he once was and I have gone from being fearful for him to being afraid of him.Name and address supplied\n Your article says NHS England played down the findings on which you report, saying that the survey was based \u201con the view of a tiny fraction of GPs \u2013 roughly 3%\u201d. The margin of error in similar random samples is related to the number of responses, 1,000 in this case, rather than on the fraction of the population. The figures presented are so stark that small sampling errors cannot put the conclusions in any doubt.David HitchinSeaford, East Sussex\n Re your article (A doctor\u2019s perspective: \u2018Youth services are at breaking point\u2019, 31 December), until austerity measures were implemented from 2010 onwards, the term \u201cyouth services\u201d referred to a wide range of provision, including Camhs, professional youth services, drug and alcohol outreach programmes, and all-year-round activities including diversionary programmes that help young people to build up confidence, resilience and access to multi-agency support.\nThe decimation of most of these services can only have contributed to the escalation of child mental health concerns, now at unprecedented levels. A significant percentage of vulnerable young people have little or no contact with their GP, and often the GP surgery is perceived as a last resort for young people who are striving to cope with depression or suicidal thoughts. Therefore the survey of GPs on which you report reveals only the tip of the iceberg in terms of inadequate child mental health provision, and this problem can only be meaningfully addressed by reinvestment in youth services as a whole.Norma HornbyWarrington, Cheshire\n The concern about mental health care for children is longstanding. In 2013 I was overseeing child protection in several areas of England. I wrote to the secretaries of state for health and education about young people with mental health difficulties who were profoundly distressed at being held on paediatric wards, because of the national shortage of child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient beds. It was and is a disaster waiting to happen. The ambulant adolescents, whose disturbance increases while confined on an inpatient paediatric medical ward, are among very ill young children who are, for example, being tube-infused with medication. The secretaries of state (Michael Gove and Andrew Lansley) in 2012 did nothing to mitigate the dangers then, and they still continue today. Dr Ray JonesEmeritus professor of social work, Kingston University\n As a former governor of an NHS mental health trust, I am not surprised that the promised increase in mental health staff is unlikely to be achieved (Report, 2 January). My trust relied heavily on locum doctors and agency and bank staff to cover vacancies, which in the area of mental health is not conducive to effective patient care \u2013 continuity of care is essential in building trust between patients and practitioners. The effect of Brexit, with EU staff leaving, the withdrawal of nurse training bursaries and NHS pay restraints are major factors in the failure to recruit more permanent staff \u2013 all directly caused by the government\u2019s policies.Ian ArnottPeterborough\n In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

The Antrim-trained horse finished strongly to score by two and a half lengths from Bear\u2019s Affair but the owner of the runner-up suggested at Cheltenham on New Year\u2019s Day that the result may yet be reversed.\n\u201cWe were second in the Foxhunters at Liverpool,\u201d George Barlow reminded a group of reporters, adding that he had been told to expect he would be awarded the Aintree race. \u201cThe Irish horse is being thrown out, apparently. But I haven\u2019t officially been told. It\u2019s common knowledge in the racing world but they haven\u2019t actually told me. I might get a letter any day. I\u2019ve been waiting 230 days for the official result.\u201d\nGraham McKeever, who has trained Balnaslow for the past two years, gave a short response when asked on Wednesday about possible disqualification. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk to you about it,\u201d he replied. \u201cThanks for the call.\u201d\nBarlow was speaking in the aftermath of Beware The Bear\u2019s victory at Cheltenham, a first at the track for the veteran owner. Bear\u2019s Slipper carried his blue and red colours to victory in the Cheltenham version of the Foxhunters in 1973, only to be demoted for bumping a rival on the run-in.\nRumours are said to have been swirling around the Irish point to point scene for the past two months that Balnaslow is at risk of losing his April victory, the most significant of his long career, which began almost eight years ago. The bay had been a strong-finishing runner-up in the Aintree race the previous year and was a popular winner in the 2018 edition, for which he was second-favourite at 11-2. It was also an emotional moment for those connected to Balnaslow whose owner, Peggy Hagan, had died the previous November.\nThe British Horseracing Authority has a policy of not commenting in such cases. It gave its stock response when asked if there is any concern about Balnaslow\u2019s win: \u201cThe BHA does not comment on investigations or speculation surrounding potential investigations.\u201d\nLudlow 12.40 Capone 1.15 Le Precieux (nap) 1.45\u00a0Silver Kayf 2.15 Agent Memphis (nb) 2.50\u00a0Financial Conduct 3.25 Elena Sue\nSouthwell 12.55 Constituent 1.30 Temur Khan \n2.00 Mr Strutter 2.35 Fink Hill 3.10 The Right Choice 3.45 Thunder Buddy\nChelmsford 4.10 Originaire 4.45 Bubbly 5.20 Scofflaw 5.55 Teruntum Star 6.25 Shamshon 6.55 Mr Potter 7.25\u00a0Affair 7.55 Hard Toffee\nIf Balnaslow were eventually to be disqualified or demoted that would not necessarily imply any fault on the part of his connections. McKeever has a good reputation among his peers, one of whom expressed sympathy for his situation on Wednesday.\nFrost covers went down at Sandown on Wednesday in an attempt to ensure that Saturday\u2019s meeting goes ahead. Sharp frosts are forecast for Thursday and Friday nights but Andrew Cooper, clerk of the course at the Surrey track, is very hopeful of racing going ahead unless temperatures are not much lower than expected.\nIf so, punters may get a first glimpse this season of the second-favourite for the Champion Hurdle, as Laurina is entered for a hurdle race on the card. The going on the hurdles track is still mostly soft, which is important, as her connections would not want to risk her on a drying surface.",

Most of the deaths were the result of collisions with marine vessels. Rope entanglements from fishing boats were also suspected in two deaths. Another six were killed in American waters.\nSweeping measures introduced last year by Canada\u2019s government include a 100-meter buffer zone between the whales and boats, fishing closures and vessel slowdowns. Violations of the rules can run steep: fines range from C$100,000 ($73,000) to C$500,000 ($366,543) \u2013 with repeat offenders facing potential jail time.\nLarge boats, including cruise ships, are required to slow their speed down to 10 knots in protection zones, reducing the risk of colliding with whales. The new limits have prompted some cruise ship companies to modify itineraries and bypass the region.\nThe government has also implemented dynamic fishing closures, meaning fishermen must quickly pull up any traps, lines and ropes if whales are spotted in the area.\nThe habitat range of right whales has become increasingly erratic and unpredictable, making it difficult to anticipate which areas are in need of closure.\nIn recent years, right whales have become a common sight in the Gulf Saint Lawrence \u2013 Canada\u2019s busy shipping thoroughfare \u2013 setting the stage for deadly interactions with marine traffic.\nThe strict rules have frustrated both the fishing industry and residents in the Quebec and Newfoundland. Over the summer, Nadia Minassian, the prefect for the town of Rocher-Perc\u00e9 in Quebec, called the rules \u201cdraconian and uncompromising\u201d.\nFishing groups have argued the regulations are too broad and are in need of further refinement.\nWhile the government has acknowledged the protections have affected local economies, the rules are likely to remain in place for 2019.\nAdam Burns, the director-general of fisheries management at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, told the Canadian Press in the summer: \u201cThese measures have a real impact on fish harvesters, processors and communities in Atlantic Canada; however the long-term economic risks of not adequately protecting North Atlantic right whales is greater.\u201d",

The claims are now the subject of an independent investigation led by a City law firm.\nEpworth owns a small stake in Ted Baker and is said to have urged swift action, including changes to the corporate culture, if wrongdoing was unearthed.\nOn its website the fund, which has \u00a31.4bn of assets under management, says it aims to ensure that its investments are \u201cconsistent with the Christian faith and that it seeks to use its \u201cinfluence to improve ethical standards in the businesses we invest in. We ask ourselves if the companies we are investing in are sustainable and operating in a way that is to the benefit of all stakeholders, including wider society.\u201d\nThe Ted Baker controversy came to light in early December when a petition appeared on the employee campaigning platform Organise. The petition called for an end to the alleged behaviour, saying: \u201cIt is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged.\u201d\nUntil the Observer reported the allegations, Kelvin\u2019s hugs were accepted as part of a quirky culture at Ted Baker\u2019s London head office, according to current and former employees. But staff of both sexes have now accused Kelvin of ear kissing, shoulder massages and asking young female employees to sit on his knee.\nAfter several days of allegations the company brought in the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills to lead an investigation. Organise said it had sent about 100 anonymised reports of alleged harassment to the Ted Baker board. Herbert Smith will report back to a committee of Ted Baker\u2019s non-executive directors.\nKelvin, who owns a 35% of the listed company, initially tried to continue in the role of chief executive but agreed to take a voluntary leave of absence after the company\u2019s board was made aware of \u201cfurther serious allegations\u201d.\nThe 63-year-old opened the first Ted Baker store in Glasgow in 1988 and, 30 years on, it has 544 outlets worldwide and annual sales of \u00a3590m. Kelvin released a statement in which he said the accusations were \u201cvery serious and upsetting\u201d and that it was \u201conly right\u201d they should be investigated.\nHe added: \u201cTed Baker has been my life and soul for 30 years. I love this company and I care deeply for all my colleagues. Ted Baker means everything to me and I can\u2019t bear to see it harmed in any way.\u201d\nTed Baker and Epworth declined to comment on the letter.",

        "content": "The city state has a strange appeal to some Tories yet even its prime minister doubts its approach would work in Britain\nThe foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on a visit to Singapore to learn how such a relatively isolated city state has become so successful is only the latest, but most explicit, of a long line of Tory ministers to extol it as the model for the UK post-Brexit.\nQuite how Singapore, an authoritarian state capitalist economy akin to China, has become the pre-eminent Tory model for the UK post-Brexit, as opposed to other more democratic economies, is puzzling.\nMargaret Thatcher was a great admirer of the former British colony, but more recently others who have been intrigued by Singapore\u2019s success include Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Michael Gove as education secretary in 2012 and Owen Paterson, a luminary of the Tory Eurosceptic benches. Others, such as Sir James Dyson, the Brexiter businessman, speak with their wallet. He picked Singapore and not the UK post-Brexit to build his new electric vehicle. Javid at least speaks from experience \u2013 he earned \u00a33m a year as head of Deutsche Bank\u2019s Singapore trading division.\nHunt, quickly refashioning his modernising politics to suit an imminent date with a Tory party electorate, is a more surprising advocate for Singapore. He used an article in the Mail on Sunday before his visit on Wednesday to hail its remarkable transformation from a tiny territory devoid of natural resources into the world\u2019s eighth-richest country, adding it was \u201ca reminder of the tidal shifts that can exist within the ebb and flow of the changing world order\u201d.\nIn taking this course, Hunt is taking a political risk both for himself and for Brexit. He risks burning his remaining bridges with the small modernising base in the Tory party, but he also risks associating Brexit at such a sensitive time with an economic and democratic model that may be anathema to wavering Brexit voters.\nBrexit critics often claim the Tory party vision is for a deregulated Singapore-on-Thames, and here is a senior cabinet minister only weeks before the key Brexit vote travelling 6,700 miles to confirm this to be the case.\nFor EU negotiators, anxious that a bargain-basement Britain does not have privileged access to its single market, the warning could not be clearer.\nAt one level, the parallels with the birth of Singapore and post-Brexit Britain are worth drawing. Singapore was expelled in 1965 from its short-lived union with its larger Malaysian neighbours, something that proved to be a blessing in disguise for a small city state few thought could prosper alone.\nAt the time of independence, Singapore\u2019s GDP per capita stood at just $512. Now it has the eighth-largest GDP per capita in the world and is consistently ranked among the tiger countries, with the highest density of millionaires relative to population. Its achievements in schooling and housing are striking.\n\u201cWe had to create a new kind of economy, try new methods and schemes never tried before anywhere else in the world, because there was no other country like Singapore,\u201d wrote Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s founder in his memoirs, From Third World to First.\nBut here the potential parallels between two nations reborn become more difficult. Lee explicitly refused to cede any ground to democracy while Singapore\u2019s fellow Asian tiger economies were democratising.\nBeginning in 1963, political rival the Socialist Front \u2013 a left-wing split from the ruling People\u2019s Action party (PAP) \u2013 suffered mass arrests through the use of the Internal Security Act. Subsequent parliamentary elections have not exactly been cliff-hangers. Thanks to a mixture of bans, libel laws and media repression, the PAP manages to win all but three or four of the 80-plus seats up for contest.\nSingapore had indeed modernised and developed economically, yet its authoritarian rule went unchallenged. As Milton Friedman, the great free-market economist observed in the 1990s, as much of the world succumbed to democratic rule, Singapore demonstrated that \u201cit is possible to combine a free private market economic system with a dictatorial political system\u201d.\nIndependent trade unions were so weakened that by the 1970s strikes and work stoppages had disappeared. Wages have been kept low through the use of state-sponsored trade unions and the widespread use of cheap migrant labour, something that Brexit is designed to halt. Income inequality has also widened, even if on most measures it is wider in the US.\nThroughout his life, Lee defended this trade-off of democratic rights for growth, insisting that the former would have precluded the latter. \u201cWe decide what is right, no matter what the people think.\u201d\nAsked on BBC Radio 4 how Singapore fitted into his \u201cinvisible chain of democracies\u201d Hunt simply changed the subject. In a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, he resorted to euphemism: \u201cThe British legacy of the rule of law, clean administration, independent courts and the English language have all been part of Singapore\u2019s success.\u201d\nIt is also not clear if Singapore\u2019s transformation into an export-orientated manufacturing base for international capital is relevant to the modern UK. Singapore grew at a time when globalisation allowed multinational corporations to take advantage of different labour and production costs in manufacturing. There is little chance, for instance, of the UK becoming a major exporter of electronic goods based on low wages.\nSingapore also grew through a form of state intervention more associated with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, than pro-Brexit economist Patrick Minford. Large infrastructure projects were financed from a fund based on state-compelled savings. State enterprise and public investment were at the heart of the growth. Housing is largely publicly owned.\nSignificantly, one of the observers most sceptical about the parallels between Singapore and Brexit is Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. In an interview with Bloomberg in November he said: \u201cThe Singapore government accounts for 16% of GDP, maybe 17%. So to say that you\u2019re going to be like Singapore, are you going to give up two-thirds of your government spending, state pensions and national health?\u201d\nHunt would presumably answer in the negative, inviting the wider question as to what cause he is advancing by his visit.",

        "content": "Human reactions to shark attacks have fascinated Fiona Adolph for more than a decade. Here she examines a global hotspot, Western Australia\nOn a whisper-still January dawn, the most terrifying day of Allan Oppert\u2019s life began unremarkably and with a feeling of deep calm.\nLike most Sundays, he woke to a knock on the door from his friends Dan and Dave. At Allan\u2019s neat house in the small seaside town of Binningup, in the south-west corner of Western Australia, the three men drank strong coffee before towing Allan\u2019s boat to a nearby ramp where three friends were launching another vessel. The two groups were heading out on the ocean together, a familiar arrangement aimed at ensuring safety.\nOppert turned the key on his boat\u2019s engine as the western horizon illuminated a glassy sea, a low swell barely bothering the shore. At the height of an Australian summer, mornings on the ocean offered early respite from the baking heat and unrelenting wind of the afternoon. The two boats were heading to a dive site that the men visited most weekends of the year, conditions allowing. A 15-minute boat ride from shore, the site featured a roughly cylindrical cavity about 6m wide and 3m deep on the ocean floor. In 33m of water, the \u201ccrater\u201d bristled with crayfish, a delicious but formidable-looking crustacean prized for its sweet, delicate flesh. After several hours and two separate dives into the heart of the crater, a single tank of air remained between the six men.\nI said to Dan, \u2018You go,\u2019 and he said, \u2018No, you go.\u2019\nAfter entering the water for his third dive of the day, this time alone, Oppert, a 42-year-old prison officer, began his descent. The process, as always, involved the release of air from inside his buoyancy vest to enable heavy weights strapped to his hips to drag him from the surface to the ocean floor. But this time he didn\u2019t quite make it. The torpedo-shaped bulk of a huge great white shark inside the crater below loomed into view and, in the nanosecond that followed, Oppert registered both the animal\u2019s curious demeanour \u2013 \u201clike a dog on a scent\u201d \u2013 and a firm belief that his life would not end there.\n[The shark is] going over to one spot and having a look and going over to another and having a sniff. These sharks are like dogs, in their gestures and in their behaviour. They hunch up their backs when they are annoyed, and she was annoyed. All of a sudden, she\u2019s spun around. I got about halfway to the bottom. [I thought,] \u2018She\u2019s going to attack from the back or she\u2019s going to attack from the side.\u2019 The funny thing is that I didn\u2019t think about dying.\nAn uncannily cool head gave Oppert the presence of mind to reinflate his buoyancy vest, preventing further descent. (Days later, while examining his equipment, he noted the depth gauge registered just 17 metres.)\nConsidering that great white sharks have been clocked swimming 13 metres a second, it is no surprise that the impact of the strike instantly pulled Oppert\u2019s face mask down around his neck.\nIt happened in a split second. The mouth\u2019s opened up and she\u2019s hit me in the guts with her nose. I thought: \u2018Oh, here we go.\u2019\nBut he kept his regulator \u2013 the mouthpiece that delivers air \u2013 firmly between his teeth. Throughout the dog-like shaking of his body that followed, he managed to pull the mask back over his face and purge it of water, returning terrifying visibility \u2013 an intimate view into the gelatinous gill slits of the world\u2019s biggest predatory fish.\nI thought to myself, \u2018Whew! It\u2019s big!\u2019 She was clenched down on both legs and the teeth were through to the bone. The pressure was so great that I thought if it gets any tighter, they\u2019ll snap \u2013 she\u2019ll snap both my legs off.\nOppert\u2019s steel speargun, which that morning had shot some large fish, was at the moment of the attack positioned across his thigh. It would be fair to surmise that the very implement that probably attracted the shark in the first place \u2013 by prompting fish distress signals that can travel far across the ocean \u2013 also helped to preserve his life by preventing the shark\u2019s teeth from gaining full purchase above his knee.\nWhen the shark released its grip, the inflated buoyancy vest sent Oppert shooting to the surface, where he raised the alarm and was pulled to safety.\nLike many others in Western Australia at the time, Oppert was well aware of a fatal shark attack that had occurred four years earlier on a suburban beach about 150km up the coast. A middle-aged man had been mauled in shallow water in front of dozens of onlookers. But in the years that followed the death of Ken Crew in 2000 \u2013 the first such attack in living memory \u2013 many West Australians held the view it had been a one-off event, a freakish aberration caused by a \u201crogue\u201d shark that had \u201cmistaken\u201d the swimmer for a seal. With no subsequent fatality to spook him and no inkling that an attack would kill a surfer further down the coast just six months later, Oppert had descended without a care in the world. It was a decision that nearly cost him his life and has left him 14 years later with the still visible scars from the multiple puncture marks of a shark\u2019s teeth on his legs.\nKen Crew\u2019s death in the state capital of Perth changed the city\u2019s notion of itself as a beach-lover\u2019s paradise. It marked a moment of horror that still resonates.\nEighteen years on, first-person accounts of those who swam with Crew and witnessed his death continue to have an effect on me, particularly those of his friend Jerry Ventouras.\nI turned around and saw this enormous fin travelling on the inside of Ken. It came in behind him. It was surreal. This damn big shark \u2013 somewhere between five metres and six metres \u2013 head up out of the water, its jaws wide open surging towards Ken. Without even stopping, [it] seemed to grab him across the lower half of his body, lift him out of the water and give him a couple of shakes like a dog would shake at a bone, [and then] dropped him in the middle of the pool in a great cloud of blood. There was no sound.\nWest Australians were slow to forget what they learned about great white sharks that day. For most of us, venturing into the open ocean is a matter of idle leisure no more. But the state\u2019s transition from heedless to near-hysterical has been a while in the making.\nBetween September 2011 and July 2012, five people were killed by white sharks. Their deaths brought a tangible sense of panic and turned WA into an undisputed white shark hotspot. With each new encounter, swimmers, surfers and divers have become both more jittery and polarised in their views about what should be done.\nThe WA government has installed measures to help protect ocean users. A network of 30 satellite-linked shark monitoring receivers, which signal the presence of tagged sharks, is one line of defence, in addition to the introduction of non-lethal \u201csmart\u201d drum lines \u2013 a system in which sharks are baited on a hook, then tagged and released offshore.\nThis summer, some of WA\u2019s most popular surf breaks will be linked for the first time to this broader network of receivers, and smart drum lines will be trialled. This follows the cancellation in April of the high-profile international surf competition the Margaret River Pro, after two surfers were attacked by great white sharks just hours, and a few kilometres, apart.\nThe situation became untenable when the Brazilian pro surfer and current world champion, Gabriel Medina, told his 6 million Instagram followers he didn\u2019t feel safe competing in Margaret River \u2013 an Australian surfing mecca.\nDespite bolstered aerial surveillance, smart drum lines and the addition of further shark monitoring receivers, confidence is far from buoyant. Most surfers and divers understand that only tagged sharks moving into specific swimming and surfing areas can be pinged. In WA, that\u2019s 450 sharks, of which 290 are white sharks.\nA separate problem is that many south-west surf breaks are located in deep water above dark substrate, making shark-spotting from the air almost impossible. But Surf Life Saving WA\u2019s ramped-up drone monitoring program is finding plenty of sharks, and more surfers and swimmers are staying informed about problem areas via SLSWA\u2019s Twitter feed.\nSurvivors of shark attacks and their families often lament the fact that sharks were spotted in the area hours or days beforehand and, had they had known this, they would never have entered the water.\nIn contrast to Allan Oppert\u2019s lack of concern about the shark risk, as he descended for his third dive of the day in 2004, Bernie Williams certainly did worry and was relying on his dive buddy\u2019s shark shield (a device worn on the ankle that emits an electromagnetic field to deter sharks) on the 2006 morning he met the protagonist of his worst nightmare.\nThe then 46-year-old contracts manager was on his second dive looking for exotic shells and crayfish with his friends Brian and Jenny, in 20m of water 6km off City beach in Perth. About 15 minutes into the dive, he heard an approaching boat. Sensing it had pulled up close to his own unoccupied vessel and that keys and wallets may be the target, he ascended to briefly check on the visitors. Satisfied that they seemed happily preoccupied with a matter on the opposite side of their boat, Williams descended once more. What he didn\u2019t know on that choppy January morning was that the visiting boaters \u2013 who had been fishing nearby when a huge shark appeared beside their vessel \u2013 had come to warn him and his dive buddies about the danger. They had been looking for dive bubbles over the side of their boat when Williams briefly surfaced behind them, then quickly descended again.\nBack on the ocean floor, Williams found that his friends were nowhere to be seen. So he bounced about two metres off the ocean floor to clock their position. Mid-bounce he was struck from behind with an immense force.\nI am not very small and for something to take me from zero to 100km an hour in a fraction of a second, bending me double, you think, \u2018God, have I been hit by a submarine?\u2019 It came up from below, behind, and rammed me, just hammered me. When I first got hit I was winded, picked up by the left arm and pushed through the water so the visibility went. I was stunned, didn\u2019t know what was going on. I had a dead weight hanging off my arm. Your peripheral vision in a face mask is nothing [so] when it slowed down a bit I could swing my head around. Then the bells went off. A shark\u2019s eyeball literally filled my face mask. I remember looking down its side when it was swinging me around like a dog with a goanna and I noticed my flippers were about half-way down its length. A big shark. It was just so solid. Felt like a brick wall.\nApparently hampered by the position of the spear gun along Williams\u2019 left side, the animal released its grip and the diver found himself on the ocean floor, where he quickly took refuge in the recess of a reef ledge.\nI tucked up against a wall. I remember kneeling on the sand and [the ledge] came up to just over waist height. I was hunched down but there wasn\u2019t enough room for me to get everything in there. I was really puffing hard, breathing like a steam train, beginning to hyperventilate. I remember hearing my heart banging. Banging away, banging away. Thinking to myself, \u2018I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead. This thing has got my name punched \u2026 it\u2019s not going away.\u2019 I was that close to going to the dark side \u2013 going into a blind panic, close to saying, \u2018You can\u2019t do anything, you might as well just roll over.\u2019\n[But] I was really annoyed with it, that it was going to stop me seeing my family, actually kill me. You think to yourself you [will die] unless you try and work out how you are going to get out of this. I managed to slow [my breathing] down, checked my gear was OK, keeping an eye on the shark. Still had plenty of air. It went away into the gloom. I had a rough idea where I\u2019d seen it disappear. Next thing it came flying across the reef at me. I had my spear gun and I thought I could shoot it but then it\u2019s just going to get annoyed and crazier. I saw it come in and out of the gloom. Then it charged. It ran me down like a car. It was like a dart. The distance would have been 15 to 20 metres and it covered that in a couple of seconds. I had just enough time to lift my spear gun and try to fend it off. It went straight over my head. It would have been one metre above me. The girth of the thing. Like a car going over. Massive. Absolutely massive.\nThe speed of the shark as it bit down on Williams\u2019 elbow and vigorously shook him created an unusual wound \u2013 saltwater forced into the bite area at high pressure had a gouging effect, but he didn\u2019t become aware of the pain until he realised the shark\u2019s tactics had moved him further away from the reef and out on to the sand. Returning to the cover of the reef ledge, he noticed he was bleeding badly and visibility was diminishing.\nBlood was making the water shimmery. At that stage I was feeling woozy, beginning to fade. The shark charged again. It [got to] within a couple of metres and all of a sudden it did a shimmy in the water, turned its tail and took off. The speed of the thing!\nAssuming the animal had disappeared and would soon make another run at him, Williams turned in anticipation, to see his two dive friends swimming quickly, elbow to elbow, across the reef. With Jenny signalling that she had just seen a giant shark, it was soon clear that the pair had arrived with Jenny\u2019s shark shield just in time. Bernie believes the abrupt shift in the shark\u2019s behaviour and swimming direction as it homed in for another strike signalled its clear discomfort once inside the orbit of the approaching shield.\nHe believes his friends may not have returned to find him for another 10 minutes had they not seen the shark, as both had plenty of air in their tanks. By the time the three pulled themselves to the safety of the boat just a couple of minutes later, Bernie\u2019s own tank was almost empty.\nResearch has shown that sharks maintain a pattern of \u201ctemporary residency\u201d at favoured sites along with periods of long-distance travel using some \u201ccommon corridors\u201d. They do not permanently stay at any one site but are more likely to be present at favoured places and in common corridors. The fact that they don\u2019t give birth until they reach about 5m in length and 16 years of age, and have an 18-month gestation period, make the sharks \u201cvulnerable to even low levels of exploitation (including incidental bycatch) and are slow to recover\u201d, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).\nIt is also now clear that Australia has two distinct great white shark populations; an eastern population and a western-southern population. In other words, the 2.6m great white shark that injured a surfer at Ballina, on Australia\u2019s east coast, in November 2018 probably belonged to a different \u2013 and considerably smaller \u2013 population than the animal (or animals) that attacked surfers in April in Margaret River.\nBack in 2007 one of the world\u2019s foremost white shark experts, Dr Barry Bruce, told me that anyone who thought they knew how many white sharks were cruising Australian waters was \u201cspeaking through their backside\u201d.\nIn February Bruce co-published an article in the journal Scientific Reports about a groundbreaking CSIRO study that used world-first genetic analysis to estimate that there are between about 760 and 2,250 adult white sharks (best estimate 1,460 sharks) in the southern-western population off South Australia and WA, and between about 470 and 1,030 adult white sharks off eastern Australia (best estimate 750 sharks).\nThe total white shark population off eastern Australia was estimated to be between 2,909 and 12,802 sharks (best estimate 5,460 sharks). Due to a lack of genetic data for juveniles, the total number of the southern-western population could not be directly estimated using these techniques.\nThere are double the number of adult white sharks in the WA-South Australia population and fewer surfers, swimmers and divers (4.1 million people) compared with the east coast (18.8 million). And yet, since 2000, the western population has been responsible for 21 fatalities compared with the east coast\u2019s five.\nShark nets have been used for decades on the east coast of Australia, with mixed success. But the problem of unintended bycatch, including dolphins and turtles, puts them out of favour in WA. Certainly, there is no silver bullet.\nA newly appointed independent scientific advisory panel on sharks will provide advice to the WA government on the effectiveness of its new shark mitigation technologies and scientific research into white shark populations, movements and behaviours.\nThe lead author of a University of Queensland study a that shows 90% decline in Queensland shark numbers says more advanced approaches to safeguarding ocean users are needed. Dr George Roff says drum lines, nets and culls are not the answer.\n\u201cNets do not stop sharks from entering beaches, but instead are designed to entangle and trap sharks [and] there is no scientific evidence that I am aware of that shows that culling is an effective approach to reducing shark attacks,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSmart drum lines are good for understanding where sharks go and if a certain shark tends to return to the same beach, but white sharks often travel hundreds to thousands of kilometres. For smart drum lines to be successful they have to tag a large number of sharks within the population.\n\u201cModern technologies such as camera-mounted drones can monitor beaches for sharks in real time, and Sharksafe barriers trialled in South Africa show that white sharks can be successfully excluded from swimming areas.\u201d\nJust 11 months on and about 700km away from where Bernie Williams was attacked, 15-year-old Zac Golebiowski was enjoying a morning\u2019s surf at a remote beach on Australia\u2019s south coast when his life was irrevocably changed.\nIn a nation renowned for its picturesque coastline, Esperance beaches represent some of the most \u201cgrammable\u201d of all. With bay after bay of blinding white sand and clear cerulean waters, this part of the world could have been enhanced by a Technicolor enthusiast\u2019s sleight of hand.\nBut on the morning of 2 December 2006, a bruise of clouds hung low over Esperance and a bitter south-easterly wind soured surf conditions. Golebiowski was eager for a surf, nonetheless. So he headed out by car with older brother Sam and a teenage friend to a protected cove they knew would be breaking clean and perfect.\nNestled between two national parks, Wharton beach, on Duke of Orleans Bay, is a favourite with families for its long and easy sandbar breaks close to shore.\nIt was overcast and gloomy, a \u2018sharky\u2019 morning, but sharks [were] the last thing to think about when you are 15 and going for a surf with your brother and a mate. I had never heard about sharks at Whartons \u2013 it is the last thing, the very last thing, I expected.\nThe sandbar was so shallow that, after each ride, it was impossible to turn and duck his long malibu surfboard under oncoming sets. Instead, Golebiowski rode each wave into shore, walked the length of the beach and then paddled out for the next ride.\n[After] three or four waves I got one that was a bit of a dud. It didn\u2019t quite take me all the way into the beach. I started to paddle back out to where my brother was. The shark came in from deeper water and took my right leg as I was paddling towards [him]. It came from the side and it felt like what\u2019d you\u2019d imagine a big king hit to be like. A very big strike. It was a full-on horizontal attack in water that was only just head height. When I take my friends to where the attack happened they are always amazed that a shark attack could have happened there.\nThe shark bit [off] my leg and the force of the bite took me down, pulled me under. There was no fighting for air. It was too shallow for that. It took me under and let go. I came straight back up and called for help. The [2.5-metre to three-metre) shark was probably a juvenile, curious, experimenting maybe. If it had been bigger it would have bitten me in half. A big shark in full hunting mode, it would have been carnage. [My brother] said it circled a couple of times. It could have attacked two more people but didn\u2019t. Any higher up my leg and it would have got [major] arteries.\nGolebiowski\u2019s survival was enabled by the quick and decisive action of his brother and strangers on the beach. Despite his trauma, the ocean continues to draw him in. No longer able to stand on a surfboard, he now uses a boogie board.\nIt\u2019s generally pretty good. I just think about the chances of a shark coming back and attacking a person again \u2013 it is never going to happen. But surfing at Whartons is a whole other ballgame. In the last few years with so many attacks I have thought about [the attack] more. It is coming up to 12 years since it happened. I [don\u2019t] feel comfortable out there at all.\nThere were eight WA shark fatalities in almost as many years after Golebiowski\u2019s ordeal. On 2 October 2014 Sean Pollard, then 23, narrowly escaped becoming the ninth when he suffered a devastating attack by two great white sharks at the Esperance surf break where two and a half years later, in April 2017, 17-year-old Laeticia Brouwer became the state\u2019s most recent shark attack victim.\nPollard lost his left arm and right hand, and ligaments in both legs were damaged when a shark made three ferocious strikes, as the former electrician attempted to fend it off with his surfboard. In 2015 he told 60 Minutes:\nI felt this massive bump and the shark came underneath me. I was trying to paddle calmly so I wasn\u2019t splashing around like I was panicking, but once it got directly behind me it charged. Went in for the kill. Both my arms were in its mouth, its eye was right there. That vision \u2013 this cover going over its eye as it bit down on me \u2013 [is] burnt into my mind. It took me underwater, started shaking its head. I remember having to hold my breath and it shook seven or eight times. That\u2019s when I got bumped from behind by another shark.\nBack on the surface and with both hands now severed, he lay on his back and kicked for his life, catching a wave back into shore, where decisive action by four bystanders almost certainly saved his life.\nAlmost a year after Pollard survived this attack, a free diver and spear fisher Norman Galli, then 50, dropped into a glassy sea off a small island near Albany, a five-hour drive further south. The environmental manager from Perth and his regular dive partner, Anton Van Zyl, had been in the water all morning spearing about a dozen fish when Galli felt the impact of what he initially thought must have been the hull or motor of a speeding boat.\nI was right up along a ledge that went from two metres depth down to five metres. I actually thought that the boat had driven over me \u2013 that is how hard and sudden the impact was. And how quickly it was over. I was blindsided.\nHe had twice before encountered great white sharks in the ocean at close range. In both instances \u2013 in South Africa in 2000 and near Moore River on WA\u2019s mid-west coast in 2012 \u2013 the animals departed as quickly as they appeared.\nBut this time it was a different story.\nExperienced spear fishers say the shark that is going to bite you is the one you don\u2019t see, and I certainly didn\u2019t see this shark at all. It came in at a 45-degree angle from behind and attacked very close to the surface. The impact was hard, brutal. I was shaken around like a rag doll. It was just ferocious.\nAnd, were it not for the spear gun he was carrying, his life may well have ended there and then, on 30 October 2015. Like Allan Oppert and Bernie Williams, Norman Galli believes that the steel implement saved his life. In the first moment of the attack, the gun was rammed hard up against his ribcage. He believes its barrel became stuck in the back of the shark\u2019s jaw.\nThe town of Albany was a whaling port until 1978, when ships carrying harpooned whales would attract hungry white sharks in their wake. There have been several shark attacks in the area in recent years, including the fatal mauling of the 17-year-old spear fisher and free diver Jay Muscat nine months before Norman Galli\u2019s close call, and in the same stretch of water.\nFree divers descend for minutes at a time on a single breath of air \u2013 held for long enough to locate and harpoon a fish, and return to the surface, which is where Galli was floating at the time of the attack.\nIt shook me violently and I felt the cut of a tooth in my stomach. There was just a lot of white water and foam. When it released me and the commotion stopped I lifted my head out of the water, expecting to see the boat on top of me, but it was in the same position 150 metres or so away. I shouted for Anton. I backed up into a two-metre-deep rock ledge with my back towards Bald Island, feeling very vulnerable without my spear gun, which I could see about 20 metres away. Anton had parked the boat a safe distance from the swell and surge, which was crashing in to the island, and he called me to the boat. The island is surrounded by tall granite cliffs so I couldn\u2019t get out of the water. I had to swim 30 metres or so. I didn\u2019t know what had happened until I climbed on to the boat and blood was dripping from my stomach. When I lifted my arm, there were teethmarks in the wetsuit.\nIt is difficult to tell whether any of the attacks described here might have been prevented by the mitigation strategies now in place in WA. Even if the shark that attacked Golebiowski in Esperance had been tagged, there were no receivers at the remote beach and, even if there had been, who knows whether an alert would have reached him in time. The same could be said of Galli and Pollard.\nBut for surfers and divers in particular, shark shields are recognised as potent protection. Among the suite of measures designed to keep ocean users safer, the WA government has introduced a rebate for approved shields, the first such initiative in the world.

        "content": "Minister\u2019s office falsely claimed it held no internal records to block journalist\u2019s freedom of information request\nThe Victorian government falsely claimed it held no internal records on its decision to ban Sky News from train stations to block a journalist\u2019s freedom of information request.\nThe state Labor government found itself under immense scrutiny in August for banning Sky News from train station screens following the broadcaster\u2019s interview with far-right extremist Blair Cottrell.\nSoon after the decision, the independent researcher William Summers lodged a freedom of information request with the then transport minister, Jacinta Allan, asking for \u201call documents held by her office, including emails, regarding the decision\u201d.\nThe request was processed by the department of economic development, jobs, transport and resources. The department\u2019s decision, seen by Guardian Australia, claimed it could do nothing because the documents could not be found.\n\u201cIn response to your request a thorough search was undertaken of the minister for transport\u2019s office for documents relevant to your request,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe search did not discover any relevant documents.\u201d\nPerplexed, Summers put in the same FOI with a separate agency, Public Transport Victoria, asking for its correspondence with the minister.\nEarlier this month, PTV handed Summers a series of emails between it and the minister\u2019s office. The emails clearly related to the Sky News decision and fell within the scope of Summers\u2019 request. They include a briefing to the minister\u2019s office on several options to restrict Sky News at Victorian train stations, including the removal of the channel from the content loops played on the screens.\nThis article includes content provided by Scribd. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nSummers described the case as a \u201cjoke\u201d. He has filed an official complaint with the information commissioner.\n\u201cClearly the minister\u2019s office had these documents too, but refused to disclose them, instead claiming no such documents existed,\u201d Summers said. \u201cI find it hard to believe this could even be an administrative error given the high profile and recentness of the issue.\u201d\nThe minister\u2019s office said the process was \u201cconducted within the requirements of the FOI Act\u201d.\nIn his complaint to the information commissioner, Summers makes the point that the information is now practically useless, given the delays in its release. An election has since passed, and the issue is no longer relevant in any sense.\nBut he argued that preventing this kind of behaviour was critical to the proper functioning of the state\u2019s FOI laws.\n\u201cWe have since had an election and a Cabinet reshuffle,\u201d he said in his formal complaint. \u201cGetting further information about this now is a pointless exercise. What is at stake, however, is the very basis of the FOI Act, and the responsibility of government departments and agencies to comply with it.\u201d\n\u201cI would therefore like the Information Commissioner to investigate why the three emails from PTV to the minister\u2019s office were not handed over in response to my initial FOI request to the minister\u2019s office.\u201d",

The law came into force 24 hours before the minister, Mark Field, arrived in the country.\nField, the Asia and Pacific minister, arrived in Vietnam Wednesday morning and sent out a tweet saying that media freedom would \u201chelp Vietnam realise its enormous potential\u201d. He also said in an article in a Vietnamese newspaper that Britain would strengthen its relationship with the one-party communist state after Brexit.\nOn 1 January Vietnam introduced a cybersecurity law forcing internet providers to censor content deemed \u201ctoxic\u201d by officials.\nField said the UK would strengthen its cooperation over Vietnamese cybersecurity. Nearly \u00a35m in telecoms intercept equipment has been approved for sale to Vietnam since 2015. Campaigners against the arms industry say that action could be used to implement the crackdown on free speech.\nA free press and a free internet help economies grow and innovate; media freedom will help Vietnam realise its enormous potential. Fascinating discussion with those involved in the sector here @UKinVietnam @GarethWardUK pic.twitter.com/5R778JcGxe\nResponding to Field\u2019s comments, Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said there was no substantive ground to believe Vietnam was prepared to end its crackdown on freedom of speech and civil society.\nRobertson said: \u201cThe reality is, freedom of the press doesn\u2019t exist in Vietnam because the government exerts effective control over all media outlets in the country. Up until now social media has been the outlet for free expression but the Vietnam government now has a draconian new law on cybersecurity which it can use as the hammer it needs to shut down online discussions and prosecute persons for what they say.\n\u201cThe UK should publicly demand the revocation of the cybersecurity law and bend over backwards to ensure that no British government programmes or foreign investment do anything to facilitate the deepening crackdown.\u201d\nThe Foreign Office said that Field raised the issue of media freedom including specific concerns about the new law with his Vietnamese counterparts on Wednesday, he also convened media freedom experts and activists to discuss the issue in Hanoi on the same day. They said the tweet was issued to accompany that event and said that the tweet said that Vietnam must have media freedoms in order to realise its enormous potential.\nDespite the human rights situation in Vietnam, UK officials have cultivated the country as a customer for British military and security technology, approving \u00a377m of sales of weapons and dual-use technologies since the Conservatives gained power in May 2015.\nVietnam was one of a number of countries invited to shop for surveillance equipment at a Home Office-sponsored arms fair in March 2017; months later civil servants from the Defence and Security Organisation, the government body that promotes arms manufacturers to overseas buyers, joined 14 different UK arms companies on a promotional tour of the country.\nIn November last year Vietnam\u2019s deputy minister of national defence, Nguyen Chi Vinh, visited London for a joint \u201cdefence policy dialogue\u201d summit co-chaired by Earl Howe, the minister of state for defence.\nAmong the most concerning exports, according to Andrew Smith, a spokesman for Campaign Against Arms Trade, was \u00a35m worth of telecommunications interception equipment. \u201cInterestingly one licence was refused in 2017, so the [UK] government clearly thinks there is some degree of risk, but has allowed 18 other licences since May 2015.\u201d The most recent was in January 2018, Smith said, adding: \u201cSurveillance equipment is particularly sensitive when put in the hands of authoritarian states.\u201d\nA Foreign Office spokesperson also said that media freedom was a priority for Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, which was why he was hosting an international conference on the issue in London this year.",

Emergency services arrived at the house in Kirton, near Boston, at around 3am on 1 January.\nThree as yet unidentified British people \u2013 a woman aged 27 and two men aged 24 and 32 \u2013 were found dead after the fire was extinguished, police said, adding that they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the fire.\nNeighbours came to the aid of those trapped inside the detached house when they saw flames shooting through the roof.\nJohn Holland, 68, who lives opposite, was woken by his Jack Russell barking some time after 2am. \u201cWhen I looked through the window, I could see flames reflecting in the windows,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I quickly got dressed, went outside, and then I saw the fire in the big upstairs front bedroom window, on the left. The flames were coming up through the roof and it was well ablaze.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThere was no smoke in the downstairs, and we could see a lady in the downstairs window. So me and this other chap, we rushed over to the front door and we were telling the woman, \u2018Open the door\u2019.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I can\u2019t find the key\u2019, so we looked around, I picked up a brick and we smashed the plate glass in the porch. We knocked all the sharp edges off and dragged her through and out.\u201d\nHe added that the woman was extremely distressed, telling neighbours, police and firefighters there were still people inside. \u201cShe said, \u2018There\u2019s somebody upstairs,\u2019 but then, just as she did, the whole roof above the upstairs bedroom caved in,\u201d Holland said. \u201cIt spread and really got going then, all across the upstairs. It was really quick.\u201d\nHolland said another woman escaped by jumping from a window as firefighters battled the blaze. The fire caused every window on the upper floor to shatter and part of the first-floor wall to collapse. Both women have now been discharged from hospital.\nLincolnshire police appealed for witnesses and for anyone with information about the occupants of the house to contact them. A spokesman said: \u201cIt will take some time to formally identify them, but at this time we believe we know who they are, and their families have been notified and family liaison officers are in contact with them.\n\u201cWe can confirm that we are treating this as a domestic-related murder investigation, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this.\u201d\nNeighbours told Lincolnshire Live they heard explosions and thumping when the fire took hold. David Brown said: \u201cI went over this morning to see how the house was and I think they are probably going to have to pull it down \u2026 It is a devastating thing to happen in this community.\u201d",

        "content": "Images of rock on the edge of the solar system were taken on the most distant flyby in history\nNasa\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft has beamed home its first close-up images of Ultima Thule, a lump of rock the shape of an unfinished snowman that lies 4 billion miles away on the edge of the solar system.\nTaken as the probe sped past the body in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day, the pictures reveal a dark reddish object about 21 miles long and 10 miles wide that spins on its axis once every 15 hours or so. The colour image of Ultima Thule, revealing its reddish tint, was taken at 05.01 GMT on New Year\u2019s Day from a distance of about 18,000 miles, 30 minutes before the probe made its closest pass of the space rock.\nThe spacecraft snapped thousands of images of the object, known formally as 2014 MU69, in a fleeting encounter that set a record for the most distant flyby in history. From a billion miles beyond Pluto, it takes data sent at the speed of light about six hours to reach Earth.\n\u201cMeet Ultima Thule,\u201d said Alan Stern, the mission\u2019s principal investigator, as he unveiled the images at a press conference on Wednesday. The scientists originally described the object as shaped like a bowling pin, but Stern said he had changed his mind on seeing the new picture. \u201cThat bowling pin is gone. It\u2019s a snowman if anything at all,\u201d he said.\nThe odd shape of Ultima Thule is thought to have come about when swirling ice and dust particles coalesced in the early life of the solar system and eventually led to two large lumps of rock colliding and sticking together. Stern said that the gravity of each \u201clobe\u201d was enough to keep the two parts of Ultima Thule in contact.\nPreliminary analysis of the images showed that the neck that joins the two lobes of Ultima Thule is brighter than the rest of the mottled surface, probably because loose grains had collected there, said Cathy Olkin, a scientist on the mission. The dark red hue of much of the surface is thought to be due to the effects of space radiation on exotic ices on the surface.\nThe New Horizons spacecraft launched in 2006 on a mission to explore Pluto. When it shot past the dwarf planet in 2015, it captured breathtaking shots of the distant world, one now known to host mountains of solid nitrogen and volcanoes that blast ice into space.\nLike Pluto, Ultima Thule lies in a region of the solar system called the Kuiper belt, a doughnut-shaped ring of dwarf planets, boulders and other debris left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. The Nasa probe came within 2,200 miles of Ultima Thule, meaning \u201cbeyond the known world\u201d, as it hurtled past at 31,500mph.\nMission scientists at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland had to wait 10 hours for New Horizons to confirm that the flyby at 05.33 GMT on Tuesday had proceeded smoothly and that the spacecraft was still operational. At such terrific speed, a collision with a particle as small as a grain of rice could have spelt disaster for the probe.\nAt a press briefing on Tuesday to mark the flyby, team members released images of Ultima Thule taken when New Horizons was still half a million miles away. It was described by project scientist Hal Weaver as \u201ca pixelated blob\u201d, and at the time image analysts did not rule out it being two small bodies in orbit around one another.\nThe early images solved one mystery surrounding the distant space rock. Elongated bodies like Ultima Thule are expected to brighten and fade with clockwork regularity as they tumble through space. This is because the body\u2019s long side reflects more light than its short side. But Ultima Thule shows no such variation in brightness. The reason is that the rock is spinning like a propeller on an axis that points towards Earth, meaning it reflects the same amount of light in our direction all the time.\nScientists on the mission believe that studying Ultima Thule could provide unprecedented insights into the conditions that prevailed in our cosmic neighbourhood more than four and a half billion years ago. Kuiper belt objects are thought to have occupied their distant positions since the earliest days of the solar system and may look the same today as they did back then.\nIf all goes well, the spacecraft will beam home more data over the next 20 months. The highest-resolution images from the flyby are expected in February.",

In announcing the arrest three days later, the Russian Federal Security Service said he was caught \u201cduring an espionage operation\u201d, but gave no details.\nWhelan, 48, was in Moscow to attend a wedding when he suddenly disappeared, his brother David Whelan said on Tuesday.\nA state department spokesperson said that Ambassador Huntsman had visited Whelan on Wednesday in the Lefortovo detention facility, a former KGB prison in Moscow.\n\u201cAmbassador Huntsman expressed his support for Mr Whelan and offered the embassy\u2019s assistance,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that Huntsman had subsequently phoned Whelan\u2019s family.\nThe state department also said it had \u201cexpressed our concern about the delay in consular access through diplomatic channels\u201d.\nThe US has \u201cmade clear to the Russians our expectation that we will learn more about the charges and come to understand what it is he\u2019s been accused of and if the detention is not appropriate we will demand his immediate return\u201d, said the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, during a visit to Brazil.\nDavid Whelan told the Guardian: \u201cSecretary Pompeo\u2019s statement was a good start to the day.\u201d\nIn an earlier statement on his brother\u2019s disappearance, he said: \u201cWe noticed that he was not in communication on the 28th, which was very much out of character for him even when he was travelling.\u201d\nThe family found out about the arrest on Monday.\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned for his safety and wellbeing. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected,\u201d David Whelan said.\nIn another interview, he added his brother had been to Russia several times, so when a fellow former marine was planning a wedding in Moscow with a Russian woman he was asked to go along to help out.\nThe morning of his arrest, he had taken a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums. The last time anyone heard from him was at about 5pm and then he failed to show up that evening for the wedding, his brother said.\n\u201cIt was extraordinarily out of character,\u201d he said.\nThe family feared he had been mugged or was in a car accident, David Whelan said, and it was when searching the internet on Monday that he learned of the arrest.\n\u201cI was looking for any stories about dead Americans in Moscow, so in a way it was better than finding out that he had died,\u201d he said.\nThe spying charges carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years.\nDavid Whelan said he has no idea why his brother was targeted by the Russian security services. Paul Whelan had traveled to Russia in the past for work and to visit friends he had met on social networks, his brother said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that he\u2019s a spy,\u201d David Whelan told CNN on Wednesday.\nPaul Whelan did multiple tours in Iraq with the US Marine Corps, his brother said. He now lives in Novi, Michigan, and is director of global security for BorgWarner, where he has worked since early 2017.\n\u201cHe is responsible for overseeing security at our facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, and at other company locations around the world,\u201d a company spokeswoman, Kathy Graham, said in a statement.\nShe said BorgWarner did not have any facilities in Russia.\nPaul Whelan previously worked for Kelly Services, which does maintain offices in Russia, his brother said.\nThe arrest comes as US-Russian ties are severely strained, in part over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nA Russian gun rights activist, Maria Butina, is in US custody after admitting she acted as a secret agent for the Kremlin in trying to infiltrate conservative US political groups as Donald Trump was seeking the presidency. She pleaded guilty in December to a conspiracy charge as part of a deal with federal prosecutors.\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed that the case is fabricated and that Butina entered the guilty plea because of the threat of a long prison sentence.",

        "content": "Fifteen games into his career with Crystal Palace, and 83 minutes into a match that seemed certain to end in deadlock, Jordan Ayew scored a goal. He took it nicely too, collecting a wayward shot by Patrick van Aanholt before slotting the ball into the net from six yards. Luka Milivojevic then confirmed a precious away win for Roy Hodgson\u2019s side by converting a penalty in stoppage time after Ryan Bennett upended Wilfried Zaha.\nAyew\u2019s goal, his first since joining Palace on loan from Swansea in the summer, was particularly timely on a day when the club\u2019s attempt to sign the Liverpool reserve striker Dominic Solanke broke down. \u201cWe were interested but it turns out there are complications,\u201d said Hodgson, who refused to comment on reports that Palace became unsure about the player\u2019s fitness, adding: \u201cI do feel a little disappointed for the player because at one stage he had made up his mind in our favour but it didn\u2019t work out. There are other elements that are beyond a coach\u2019s control.\u201d\nPalace\u2019s two goals here brought the tally for the season to 19 from 21 Premier League matches and Hodgson suggested the club may yet sign someone else to help bolster their options. Any transfer may be partly funded by the departure of Jason Puncheon, with Hodgson saying the club are in talks over a potential departure of the midfielder to Huddersfield.\nWolves, too, are keen to sharpen their attack and are interested in Tammy Abraham, the Chelsea forward who has scored regularly while on loan this season at Aston Villa. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo would not say anything about that beyond indicating that Wolves are on the prowl this month for players who could enhance them \u201cbut the core of the squad will stay the same\u201d.\nOn the pitch, meanwhile, Nuno did not get what he wanted. Immediately after beating Tottenham at Wembley on Saturday, the manager made a new year\u2019s resolution that he demanded his team honour: improve the home form. Instead, Wolves broke it at the first chance. They have now lost five of their last seven matches at Molineux.\nFor a long time here it looked like the only losers would be the 30,666 spectators who turned up to watch two weary-looking sides grapple weakly with each other. Effort was plentiful but there was little zip or spark.\nIn the 11th minute Matt Doherty produced the first shot of the contest, an otherwise insignificant effort that drifted over the bar from long range. Palace\u2019s first shot followed nine minutes later and brought a save from Rui Patr\u00edcio. Andros Townsend created the opportunity by nicking the ball off Willy Boly before passing infield to Milivojevic, who tried to poke the ball into the net from the edge of the area.\nIn general the match wavered between the humdrum and the torpid. Perhaps that is why Palace\u2019s defenders almost nodded off as half-time approached, leaving Boly free to meet a corner eight yards from their goal. He misdirected his header before Doherty tried to reroute the ball towards the target but nodded over from six yards.\nWolves tend to be stronger in second halves and hinted at new energy after the resumption here, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez tearing down the left wing and crossing for H\u00e9lder Costa who, under pressure, could not guide his shot on target. Jonny Otto was even less accurate in the 58th minute, sending the ball skyward from the edge of the box after being picked out by Doherty. And so the game\u2019s pattern continued: much earnest intent and diligent to-ing and fro-ing but little or no spark.\nA breakthrough looked unlikely. And then the improbable happened: a goal, and for Ayew to boot. Fittingly it was created by a miscue, Van Aanholt\u2019s shot from 18 yards flying to the forward. Ayew reacted with nimble precision, controlling the ball before finishing smartly. \u201cIf anyone deserved a goal it was him,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cHe did a lot of good work apart from his goal, defending well from the front and stretching their defence.\u201d\nZaha stretched that defence to breaking point again in stoppage time, his trickery too much for Bennett, whose tackle demanded to be punished. Milivojevic obliged.",

        "content": "Incoming Utah senator says president has abandoned allies and failed to lead a \u2018divided, resentful and angry\u2019 nation \nMitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate and incoming US senator for Utah, has sharply criticised Donald Trump both personally and professionally, accusing him of deserting the nation\u2019s allies and lacking the character to lead a \u201cdivided\u201d nation.\nRomney said on Wednesday afternoon that it was Trump\u2019s abrupt announcement last month that he intended to pull US troops out of Syria immediately that prompted the incoming senator to write an opinion article criticizing the president.\nIn a Washington Post essay published on Tuesday evening, Romney said Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cmade a deep descent\u201d in December and blamed him for the departures of the defence secretary, Jim Mattis, and White House chief of staff, John Kelly.\n\u201cThe appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president\u2019s thoughtless claim that America has long been a \u2018sucker\u2019 in world affairs all defined his presidency down,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cOn balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d\nTrump responded to Romney\u2019s criticism on Wednesday morning on Twitter, calling on him to be a team player.\nHere we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn\u2019t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!\nRomney then said in a TV interview with CNN on Wednesday afternoon that he was prepared to work with any president \u2013 but was willing to speak out when he did not agree with them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important, as I begin this new job, to make it very clear where I stand. And I also note that the departure of Secretary [James] Mattis and the decision to pull out of Syria and the abrupt way it was done was a precipitating event for my finally going on this record,\u201d he said.\nRomney praised Trump\u2019s tax policies, stance on China and appointment of conservative judges but said they were \u201cmainstream\u201d Republican policies. Since Trump\u2019s rise, Romney has been one in a long list of traditionalist Republicans who have publicly bristled at Trump\u2019s decorum and leadership style, while generally supporting his policy goals.\n\u201cTo a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA president should unite us and inspire us to follow \u2018our better angels\u2019. A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect. As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit.\n\u201cWith the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent\u2019s shortfall has been most glaring.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cTrump\u2019s words and actions have caused dismay around the world\u201d and cited Pew reports suggesting belief among people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden that the US president would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d had fallen from 84% in 2016, when Barack Obama was president, to 16% a year later under Trump.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted late on Tuesday to say that Romney \u201clacked the ability to save this nation\u201d, adding: \u201cJealousy is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it.\u201d\nRomney is staking out an independent position two days before he takes office in the GOP-controlled Senate on Thursday. It is unclear whether Trump will face a serious challenge in 2020 to securing the Republican party\u2019s presidential nomination. It would be the first time since 1992 that an incumbent had faced such a challenge.\nTrump remains extraordinarily popular with Republican voters, boasting an approval rating that hovered near the low 90s through the end of the year. But, as the Mueller investigation winds on into its third calendar year, Trump also faces increased scrutiny, with an incoming Democratic House preparing to launch a number of additional inquiries into Trump\u2019s conduct and presidency.\nRomney, who has run for president twice, has long been viewed as a potential challenger to Trump\u2019s 2020 ambitions, and the two men have had a complicated political relationship.\nTrump endorsed Romney\u2019s run for a Senate seat in Utah in February last year, as well as Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\nBut during the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a \u201cfraud\u201d who was \u201cplaying the American public for suckers\u201d. Trump responded that Romney had \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign against Barack Obama.\nDespite Romney\u2019s prior criticism, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, Trump briefly considered tapping Romney as secretary of state.\nIn his essay on Tuesday, Romney said he \u201cwill speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions\u201d.\nReuters contributed to this report\n This article was amended on 3 January 2019. The findings of the Pew reports cited by Mitt Romney related to confidence in who was US president at the time of the research to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d, rather than specifically confidence in Donald Trump as an earlier version said.",

        "content": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r knows a thing or three about impact substitutions but even Manchester United\u2019s former supersub extraordinaire must have been pleasantly surprised to see Romelu Lukaku step off the bench and score with his first touch.\nUntil the Belgian\u2019s game-changing intervention, Solskj\u00e6r had seemed outwitted by Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s contain-and-counter tactics yet by the end of a bitterly cold Tyneside night the impressive Marcus Rashford had added a second to make it four victories from four for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s interim successor.\nIt makes the Norwegian the first Manchester United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his opening quartet of games. Perhaps instructively, he acknowledged it would be \u201chard\u201d for him to relinquish the role and return to his \u201cday job\u201d at Molde in Norway during May. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t want to leave,\u201d he said, semi-teasingly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nHis smile suggested he knows he will almost certainly have to \u2013 although much more of this and all bets will be off.\nIn marked contrast, Newcastle United have won only two home games all season and are just two points above the relegation zone. If Manchester United\u2019s flight to the warmth of Dubai on Saturday evening for a mid-season training break should be a happy one, Newcastle have no reason for similar relaxation.\nBen\u00edtez was left rueing the rare goalkeeping error from Martin Dubravka which prefaced Lukaku\u2019s opener. \u201cWe have to be disappointed in the way we lost,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were very close to getting something but then we made a mistake and we paid for it.\u201d\nSolskj\u00e6r\u2019s principal success seems to have been liberating the creative imaginations of players cowed and cramped by Mourinho. Accordingly as the visiting full-backs, Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw, pushed forward against Ben\u00edtez\u2019s five-man defence and Dubravka scrambled an awkward early Rashford shot to safety, it felt as if it might be a long night for Newcastle.\nThings certainly appeared to have changed since the last time Solskj\u00e6r patrolled the away technical area here in the spring of 2014; back then Alan Pardew\u2019s Newcastle won 3-0, confirming Cardiff\u2019s relegation from the Premier League.\nNot that the Norwegian could afford to relax as he surveyed a backline which could easily have conceded an early goal when Phil Jones\u2019s ill-advised back pass played Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n onside and the hitherto noisy travelling fans congregated high in the Leazes End temporarily fell silent.\nUltimately, Jones recovered to rescue the situation but Ben\u00edtez had a glimmer of optimism.\nGranted, only Dubravka\u2019s astute positioning prevented Rashford from scoring after Jamaal Lascelles and Fabian Sch\u00e4r collided in their own area and Paul Pogba regularly advanced down the inside-left channel with destructive intent, but the visiting side\u2019s final ball was not quite coming off.\nNeither was Newcastle\u2019s but at least Christian Atsu used his pace to good effect down the home left, exploiting the space often left by Valencia\u2019s swashbuckling attacking advances. The problem was that when presented with two half chances, Atsu directed the first shot straight at David de Gea and sent the less than perfectly controlled second flashing across the face of goal.\nAnother half chance saw Rond\u00f3n connect with a decent Atsu cross but Jones\u2019s presence seemed to restrict his leap and the resultant header flew harmlessly over the bar.\nThe watching Alan Shearer might have scored in that situation but at least Rond\u00f3n was giving Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s defenders reason to curb their attacking inclinations. That mattered, particularly as, at the other end, Lascelles\u2019s style had also been cramped, albeit for a different reason, namely the yellow card he received for a wince-inducing challenge on Ander Herrera.\nIf Lascelles had enjoyed gently roughing up Rashford, Jonjo Shelvey, a second-half home substitute, contributed a couple of defence-bisecting, outside-of-the-boot passes but was lucky to stay on the pitch after a high late challenge with which he caught Pogba on the back of a knee with studs raised.\nThat incident should not detract from Ben\u00edtez\u2019s commendable gameplan. Tellingly the increasingly urgent little chats Solskj\u00e6r and his assistant, Mike Phelan, had been holding with Juan Mata and company during breaks in early second half play emphasised that Newcastle had succeeded in denying their guests room for fluid attacking manoeuvre.\nAn unlikely hero in this collective masterclass in the art of assiduous closing down was Matt Ritchie. Newcastle\u2019s right-wing-turned-left-wing-back proved intelligence and industry personified as he worked to restrict the threat from Valencia and Mata.\nThe moment had come for Solskj\u00e6r to liberate Lukaku and Alexis S\u00e1nchez from the bench and when Dubravka uncharacteristically spilled Rashford\u2019s dipping 25-yard free-kick Lukaku reacted with alacrity, scoring with his first touch by responding faster than Lascelles to drive the rebound over the line.\nTime remained for an unmarked Rashford to slide a shot through Dubravka\u2019s legs at the end of a move he had started himself. It involved Lukaku cueing up S\u00e1nchez, who marked his return from hamstring trouble with a pass which not only picked out Rashford but also rekindled visiting hopes of a top-four finish.\n\u201cMarcus has a great hit,\u201d added Solskj\u00e6r after presiding over his first clean sheet. \u201cHe must have been watching Cristiano [Ronaldo] practising. Without hitting the heights it was a very professional performance.\u201d",

Rutte has been voluble in the Brexit debate and while Van Gerwen says he is not his biggest fan he sided with Rutte as he declared Brexit to be \u201chorrible\u201d \u2013 and not just because it is eating away at his prize money.\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m going to get a visa,\u201d the champion said after receiving the Sid Waddell trophy. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible isn\u2019t it. Did you vote for Brexit? Brex-shit. I don\u2019t like it. Look at the pound and the euro. I get everything paid in pounds so just have a look how much it dropped. Let\u2019s say it dropped by 10%, that\u2019s cost me 10% of my prize money straight away. So that\u2019s quite a lot of money. But it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\nAs for Rutte, Van Gerwen said his premier had told him \u201cthat he was glad I did it for Holland and blah, blah, blah\u201d. But when asked if he could persuade Rutte to help stop Brexit, Van Gerwen said: \u201cIt\u2019s not him is it. It\u2019s your prime minister who did that, eh?\u201d\nNow 29 and with career earnings of \u00a37m, Van Gerwen believes he can go on to dominate the sport in the next decade. With plans to retire by the age of 40, he admits he will not be able to match Phil Taylor\u2019s record of 16 world titles but hopes to emulate The Power\u2019s longevity at the top.\n\u201cSixteen titles are impossible, I won\u2019t be around that long\u201d Van Gerwen said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been the king of darts for the last five years so why not a decade? Keep the positivity going, that\u2019s the most important thing. I like what I do. I love it and I work really hard to do things like this. People that know me know what it means to me and it means a lot.\u201d\nVan Gerwen will compete in the Premier League of Darts when it begins on 7 February at the Newcastle Metro Arena. Until then, and after a year he describes as \u201cdifficult\u201d, he plans to rest. \u201cThe first thing is to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own sofa that\u2019s going to be my treat. Then I\u2019m going to go on holiday with my wife and my baby. We\u2019re going to the Philippines. First to Disney World in Hong Kong and then there. We\u2019ll enjoy the time.\u201d",

The recommendations are now in the hands of outgoing state governor Rick Scott, governor-elect Ron DeSantis and the state legislature.\nOther changes proposed include ensuring school classroom doors can lock from the inside, mandatory lockdown training for teachers, and funding to install bulletproof glass on all school windows by the year 2025.\nJuliana Simone Carrasco, a high school student and volunteer with the campaign group Students Demand Action, said in response to the recommendation: \u201cAs a student attending school in Florida, I am appalled that the commission that was established to make schools in our state safer is recommending teachers carry guns.\u201d\nCarrasco added in a statement released by the Everytown for Gun Safety advocacy group: \u201cI don\u2019t want my teachers to be armed, I want my elected leaders to pass policies to keep guns out of the hands of people with dangerous intentions to begin with.\u201d\nOther critics added their opposition to the proposed policy.\n \u201cThere is no evidence that arming teachers makes kids safer,\u201d said Gay Valimont, a volunteer leader with the Florida chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. \u201cOur children deserve real solutions to keep them safe from gun violence \u2013 like a criminal background check on every gun sale \u2013 not policies that will put them at even higher risk.\u201d\nThe nation\u2019s two largest organizations of education professionals, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, have both repeatedly rejected calls for arming teachers as an answer to gun violence.\nThe idea, which is routinely floated after high-profile school shooting incidents, was given new life after being promoted by Donald Trump following the Parkland massacre. The National Association of School Resource Officers, the largest organization of school-based law enforcement officers, also opposes arming teachers.\n  The recommendation that would allow teachers to volunteer to carry weapons seeks to expand on a \u201cguardian\u201d program passed into law by the same school safety act that established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas commission in March 2018. Currently, the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program allows local school systems to partner with local sheriffs to arm eligible school employees who are not primarily classroom teachers.\nThe program is voluntary, must be approved by the school board and requires each participating staff member complete 132 hours of comprehensive firearm safety and proficiency training.\nThe commission recommended that the state legislature \u201cshould expand the guardian program to allow teachers \u2026 to carry concealed firearms on campuses for self-protection, and the protection of other staff and students in response to an active assailant incident\u201d.\nThe program\u2019s namesake, Aaron Feis, died shielding students during the 2018 attack, and the attachment of his name to the provision angered some student activists because it is unknown whether Feis would have supported the controversial program.\nThe March school safety bill also included a number of limited gun control provisions including raising the legal age to purchase firearms to 21 and allowing a court to prohibit a violent or mentally ill individual from purchasing or possessing a firearm.\nThe recommendation is a very small part of the expansive report, which lays out in second-by-second detail what is believed to have happened before, during and after the 14 February 2018, shooting attack that left 17 dead and 17 wounded.\nThe report was also highly critical of the Broward county sheriff\u2019s office, calling its active shooter policy for deputies at the time of the Parkland attack \u201cinsufficient\u201d and \u201cinconsistent with current and standard law enforcement practice\u201d. The policy extends officers\u2019 discretion on whether or not to enter the scene of a believed active shooter incident.\nThe report suggests the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cmake [it] unequivocally clear that deputies are expected to immediately seek out an active assailant and that \u2018containment\u2019 is not the policy\u201d.",

        "content": "Sweeteners may not aid weight loss, finds review, although some are querying results\nLow-calorie and artificial sweeteners, increasingly added to drinks and food as the industry responds to pressure to cut sugar, may not help people lose weight and there is not enough evidence on their safety, according to a major new review.\nThe review, carried out by Cochrane \u2013 an international non-profit research group \u2013 aims to provide evidence for the World Health Organization, which is preparing guidance on what it calls \u201cnon-sugar sweeteners\u201d or NSSs \u2013 a term that includes artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and low or no-calorie natural alternatives such as stevia.\n\u201cNo evidence was seen for health benefits from NSSs and potential harms could not be excluded,\u201d says the review, published in the British Medical Journal, which calls for better-quality research to be done.\nFood and drink manufacturers have been under pressure from Public Health England (PHE) to reduce the sugar content of their products to help tackle the obesity crisis. PHE has asked for a cut of 20% by 2020, with a 5% reduction in the year to April 2018. The industry failed to hit that target, achieving 2% instead. Many companies have opted to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar, particularly in soft drinks.\nWHO is aiming to produce guidance on sweeteners because, it says, \u201ctheir use is widespread and they continue to be heavily promoted as healthy alternatives to sugars\u201d.\nThe Cochrane review was set up to answer a set of questions posed by WHO about the effects on adult and child health of consuming sweeteners and specifically the impact on obesity.\nThe evidence analysed in the review was not very robust, said the reviewers. They included 56 studies but said most were small and did not last long enough to come to firm conclusions.\nThe studies were set up to look at different types of sweeteners, measuring weight, blood sugar (glycaemic) control, oral health, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood and behaviour in consumers. For most of them, there was no statistical difference in weight loss or health benefits of adults and children using higher doses of sweeteners rather than small amounts or none.\nThe review did not find solid evidence of any major safety issues. People who used sweeteners did not appear to have an increased cancer risk, for instance. But there was what the authors described as a \u201cvery low certainty of evidence\u201d. More and better studies of the effects and the safety of sweeteners were needed, they said.\nHowever, sweeteners had their uses, said PHE. \u201cUsing sweeteners is one way the food and drink industry can reduce sugar in everyday products,\u201d said Dr Alison Tedstone, the chief nutritionist at PHE. \u201cThe evidence suggests sweeteners are safe and can help consumers make healthier choices.\u201d\n\u201cI would say that there is no convincing evidence of clear health benefits in the general population. There might be a small benefit on weight, but we don\u2019t have high quality data with long-term follow-up that definitely confirm this effect,\u201d said Joerg J Meerpohl, co-director of Cochrane Germany and one of the authors.\n\u201cFinally, there is a good, and safe, alternative for people/people trying to loose weight: water, and non-/less-sweetened foods. In other words, there is no need to either add free additional sugar, or sweeteners in most instances.\u201d\nTom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThe findings of this study are not surprising and confirm the view that artificial sweeteners are not a magic bullet to prevent obesity. Replacement of sugary drinks with artificial sweeteners helps prevent weight gain in children but is not superior to the preferred alternative \u2013 water.\u201d\nAnother expert said sweeteners were still preferable to sugar and pointed out that some large studies not included in the review showed they did help some people lose weight.\n\u201cThis paper does not change my mind \u2013 non-sugar sweeteners remain far better than sugar-sweetened beverages given lack of calories in the former, and the well-known harms of the latter including in particular on dental health,\u201d said Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow.\n\u201cAlso, the two best randomised trials ever conducted did show benefits of lower weight gain in children and adolescents when comparing diet drinks to sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\u201cThe issue with this current study is that it also includes data from sources other than randomised trials and as soon as you do this, the quality of the evidence becomes far weaker and for this reason hard conclusions are near impossible to make from studies which mix different types of studies.\n\u201cThe authors recognise this to some extent and I strongly agree with them when they say there is a need for higher quality and larger randomised trials in the nutritional field, however hard they may be to conduct, as, without these, some issues will never be fully resolved.\u201d\nIn a linked editorial in the BMJ, Vasanti Malik, from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in the US, also said more research was needed.\nHowever, she said, based on the existing evidence, replacing sugar with sweeteners, particularly in drinks, \u201ccould be a helpful strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk [chances of having diabetes, heart disease or stroke] among heavy consumers, with the ultimate goal of switching to water or other healthy drinks.\n\u201cPolicies and recommendations will need updating regularly, as more evidence emerges to ensure that the best available data is used to inform the important public health debate on sugar and its alternatives.\u201d\n This article was amended on 4 January 2019 to make it clear that Cochrane is an international research group.",

Making passengers pay more to travel on increasingly overcrowded trains is simply not sustainable.\u201d\nFigures released annually by the Department for Transport (DfT), compiled by Labour, showed overcrowding on the 10 busiest services had increased by an average of 4.04% year on year between 2011 and 2016.\nAt that rate, the 10 busiest services would be an average of 207.9% of capacity by 2022, the party said.\nFigures released by the government in July showed the most overcrowded service last year was the 4.22am TransPennine Express from Glasgow Central to Manchester Airport, which was 211% of capacity at its busiest.\nThe DfT said overcrowding is likely to have reduced on that service since May, as it no longer stopped at Wigan, the station where the train became busiest to Manchester.\nThe department said new trains due to be introduced by TransPennine Express will have more than 30% more seats than existing services to help alleviate crowding.\nCampaigners held protests at about two dozen railway stations on Wednesday as fares rose by an above-inflation average of 3.1%. The cost of many rail season tickets has risen by more than \u00a3100.\nGrayling blamed trade unions for the price increases. \u201cThe reality is the fare increases are higher than they should be because the unions demand \u2013 with threats of national strikes, but they don\u2019t get them \u2013 higher pay rises than anybody else,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\u201cTypical pay rises are more than 3% and that\u2019s what drives the increases. These are the same unions that fund the Labour party.\u201d\nSpeaking at a demonstration outside King\u2019s Cross station in London, Jeremy Corbyn described the rises as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that was driving people away from public transport.\nResponding to Grayling\u2019s insistence that the increases were needed to fund the upkeep of the network, Corbyn said Britain must invest in railways as a public investment.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest then people will have to suffer in their journeys, and we end up with more people using their cars, and that\u2019s far more dangerous for our environment than rail travel,\u201d he said.\nOn whether it was fair to ask taxpayers to subsidise commuters, Corbyn said: \u201cAll public transport is subsidised in one form or another, and there is a public good from it. No other country in the world has a transport system that sits completely alone.\u201d\nAt Manchester Piccadilly station, union officials and Labour councillors handed out flyers with the message \u201cCut fares not staff\u201d as commuters began returning to work after the Christmas holiday.\nLorraine Southon, 57, said all three of her daily trains were usually late and she had been forced to change her route to work due to the introduction of new timetables, which caused months of disruption last year.\n\u201cIn my experience it\u2019s a very poor service,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind [fares] going up if they would improve the service, but they don\u2019t \u2013 the service continues to be poor.\u201d\nSouthon, a BT worker, added: \u201cI can\u2019t comprehend how the management continue to get these huge bonuses when the service is just so poor. Why are the bonuses not performance-based? Chris Grayling should be responsible.\u201d\nAnother commuter, Phillip Shields, 32, said: \u201cI\u2019m definitely not happy with the rise. There\u2019s no justification really for it at the moment.\n\u201cThey keep promising every year that they\u2019re going to improve services, but it never seems to materialise. It\u2019s the same statements they repeat over and over again, every year.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said: \u201cWe know people want more comfortable journeys and money from fares is crucial to underpinning over \u00a313bn of private-sector investment in 7,000 new and refurbished-like-new carriages.\n\u201cThis will mean more seats, air-conditioning, wifi and improved accessibility for millions of people right across Britain.\u201d\nA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe are investing \u00a348bn into modernising our rail network, to relieve overcrowding and deliver significant improvements in performance, punctuality and capacity.\u201cPrivatisation has reversed the decline seen under British Rail, where passenger numbers fell and stations and routes closed but we have acknowledged that 20 years on we need to review the position. That\u2019s why we have set up the Williams Review to look into the whole rail network.\u201d",

Will Wright, a partner at KPMG and one of the administrators called in to run the 125-store chain when it collapsed on December 28, said the retailer had been hit by a \u201cwave of digital disruption sweeping across the entertainment industry\u201d.\nThe entertainment market is now more than three-quarters digital, and Britain\u2019s growing love-affair with internet-based services \u2013 from Spotify, Netflix and Amazon to Apple\u2019s iTunes and Sky\u2019s store \u2013 meant total UK entertainment sales were up more than 9% at \u00a37.5bn.\nIt was the sixth successive year of growth in the entertainment sector, and the first year that games accounted for more than 50% of total sales \u2013 more than music and video combined.\nThe total music market rose almost 9% to \u00a31.3bn fuelled by huge sales of the soundtrack to the film The Greatest Showman, the biggest selling album of the year. George Ezra\u2019s Staying at Tamara\u2019s and Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide \u2013 which was released in 2017 \u2013 were the next biggest selling albums.\nStreaming now accounts for nearly two-thirds of UK music consumption \u2013 and 91bn audio streams were served to British listeners in 2018 \u2013 up 34% on 2017, and 2,350% since 2012. The landmark of 2bn streams in a single week was passed in December. The most-streamed track of 2018 was God\u2019s Plan by Drake, with One Kiss by Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa in second place.\nSales of physical music fell almost 17%, with the number of CDs sold down 23% to 32m. The rate of decline in CD sales was almost double the 12% decline recorded in 2017.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all bad news for physical formats. The continuing vinyl revival generated LP sales of 4.2m \u2013 up 1.6% on 2017. Some 12,000 albums were released on vinyl and the most-purchased was the Arctic Monkeys\u2019 Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, which became the fastest-selling LP in more than 25 years, shifting 24,500 copies in seven days after its release in May. Other big sellers on vinyl included Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Rumours, Pink Floyd\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon and The Greatest Showman.\nThe mini-revival of cassette tapes has also continued \u2013 with sales rising 125% to 50,000 last year - the most since 2004 \u2013 as artists including The 1975 re-popularise the classic format.\nThe video sector has also been hit by the digital shift. Total video sales, including physical products, were up 10% to \u00a32.3bn, but the number of DVDs sold fell 23.5%, with Blu-ray discs down 12%. Rentals declined 22% to \u00a331.7m.\nNetflix is on track to pass 10 million UK subscribers in the UK in the first quarter this year, having passed the number of households with Sky\u2019s satellite service at the end of last year. The number of subscribers to the UK\u2019s three most popular streaming services \u2013 Netflix, Amazon and Sky\u2019s Now TV \u2013 has already overtaken those signed up to all the UK\u2019s pay-TV services combined, including Sky, Virgin Media, BT and TalkTalk.\nThe biggest-selling film of the year, by a large margin, was The Greatest Showman, starring Hugh Jackman, with 2.7m combined digital and physical sales. Its digital sales of 770,000 made it the biggest selling digital movie of all time in the UK.\nOther big selling videos included comedian Kevin Bridges\u2019 Brand New Tour, which sold 213,000 copies in just four weeks, with 90% of sales on DVD, and My World, a documentary about the life of 15-year-old US YouTube star JoJo Siwa. Peter Rabbit and Incredibles 2 topped the chart of family-friendly animations.\nThe ERA points out that despite the dire state of the market for CDs and DVDs, they are still crucial for titles to become a mega-hit. Nearly two-thirds of the combined 4.3m digital and physical sales of The Greatest Showman came from buyers of traditional CDs, Blu-rays and DVDs. This trend was seen across most titles in the best-seller lists for music and video.\nIn the games market \u2013 up 9% to \u00a33.9bn across all formats \u2013 the biggest sellers were the evergreen Fifa football franchise and Red Dead Redemption 2.\nPhysical sales of console and PC games shrank slightly, by 2.8% to \u00a3770m, while digital income rose 12.5% to \u00a33bn. The games market has more than doubled in size since 2007.",

Tompkins and his practice, Haworth Tompkins, had been working on transforming the town hall building into a 21st-century arts centre when a fire in 2015 left the grand hall a charred shell. It reopened last summer, with some of the scorch marks kept deliberately.\nDavid Jubb, the BAC\u2019s departing artistic director, called Tompkins a theatremaker. \u201cAs well as being an architect he is a programmer, producer, artist, environmentalist, entrepreneur, romantic, pragmatist and humanitarian. When Steve leads a project he invites everyone to be creative.\u201d\nJubb said Tompkins succeeded in making theatre buildings that encouraged interaction, \u201cin other words to bring communities together to make change\u201d.\nAlistair Smith, the editor of the Stage, said Tompkins could be seen as a modern-day successor to Matcham, the Victorian architect responsible for many important theatres including London\u2019s Hippodrome and Hackney Empire.\nThere was a crucial difference, though. \u201cUnlike Matcham, whose theatres divided audiences by class, Tompkins\u2019 approach is all about democratising theatregoing \u2026 He is literally and physically transforming British theatre and his legacy will be experienced by millions of theatregoers for years to come.\u201d\nTompkins, whose background is in social housing, said he was \u201cthrilled and slightly taken aback\u201d at the accolade, which he said was recognition for a wider collective effort. \u201cTheatres are the places where individuals meet to affirm the things that we share in common. I hope our work can play a small role in reinforcing a civil society that all of us still want to be part of.\u201d\nNew entries in the list include Ian McKellen at number 24, the highest-ranked actor on the list. Last year the 79-year-old took on, for the second time, one of acting\u2019s biggest challenges in King Lear. In 2019 he will tour a one-man show around 80 theatres, with the money raised going back to the venues.\nOther new entries include Stephen Daldry, the director of The Jungle and The Inheritance (28th); Jamie Lloyd, the driving force behind the ongoing Pinter season in the West End (32nd); the writer and performer Arinz\u00e9 Kene (49th); the director Phyllida Lloyd (57th); and the Hamilton actor Giles Terera (87th).

Its mast snapped off in the wild weather that forced Sunderland\u2019s rescue midway through her world record attempt to be the youngest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.\nSunderland, who said she saw the footage of the rediscovered yacht on the news, said she was \u201cvery emotional\u201d.\n\u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIt brought back many memories \u2013 good and not so good \u2013 but it was neat to see it after so long. It looked a little creepy but that\u2019s to be expected after so long.\u201d\nThe yacht was spotted from the air by a tuna spotter plane about 12.30pm on Monday, 11 nautical miles from Vivonne Bay on Kangaroo Island. The South Australian police helicopter and two commercial fishing vessels were sent to investigate and identified the yacht.\nIt had not been seen since Sunderland was picked up and rescued by the French ship Ile de la Reunion on 12 June 2010, midway between Madagascar and Western Australia.\nIn a blog post written on the Ile de la Reunion hours after she was picked up, Sunderland said: \u201cThe long and the short of it is, well, one long wave, and one short mast (short meaning two inch stub.) ... am still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again.\u201d\nA month later, after she had returned home to California, she said it was unlikely the boat would ever be found.\n\u201cA lot of people have been asking about Wild Eyes,\u201d she wrote on 5 July, 2010. \u201cShe was still afloat when I boarded the Ile de la Reunion. She could end up on a beach in Western Australia at some point, but it\u2019s just a guess, we don\u2019t know for sure.\n\u201cShe would have to be very lucky to wash up on a beach, and not get smashed on the rocks or something like that. While I do wish that she would be found and fixed up, it\u2019s not all that likely she will be found.\u201d\nSunderland, now 25, set sail from Marina del Rey in California on 23 January in 2010 but had to restart her world record attempt at Cabo San Lucas in Mexico 10 days later due to electrical problems and higher-than-expected fuel and power use from her navigation and communication systems.\nHer family had bought the Australian-built Wild Eyes and in October the year before, just months after her elder brother Zach became the first person under the age of 18 to sail solo around the world, with stops and assistance, and kitted it out specifically for her journey.\nShe said on Thursday that she was curious to see whether any of her video equipment, which was recording her journey, had survived. She had closed the hatch of the racing yacht before disembarking, which may have protected the inside.\n\u201cIt would be great to try and retrieve the boat but given the costs I don\u2019t think that will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew the boat was high quality and very safe so it doesn\u2019t really surprise me that it\u2019s still floating.\u201d\nSunderland intended to beat her brother\u2019s record and complete a non-stop circumnavigation, but had to stop in Cape Town for repairs in May. She activated her emergency satellite beacons after being tumbled about in 60-knot winds and 50-foot waves about 2,000 miles east of Madagascar.\nHer parents were heavily criticised for allowing her to undertake the attempt, and Sunderland in turn criticised the media saying that her age had nothing to do with encountering a storm in the southern ocean, something she said happened to all sailors.\nAustralian Jessica Watson, who is just five months older than Sunderland, is the youngest person ever to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation and arrived home in Sydney on 15 May 2010, three days before her 17th birthday and six days before Sunderland departed Cape Town.",

Royal Navy ships continue to conduct patrols to protect the integrity of UK territorial waters.\u201d\nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has visited migrant camps in Calais, said politicians were ignoring the reasons people sought refuge in the UK. \u201cThe asylum system in France is completely deadlocked and I fear deliberately so \u2013 they should be challenged on that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut none of that means Britain can absolve itself of responsibility to refugees.\n\u201cPeople will continue to die and be at the mercy of traffickers all the time politicians pretend to play tough for votes rather than recognise why people flee.\u201d",

Another former staffer told the paper that she made $2,400 a month but that a younger male staffer whom she was supposed to manage made $5,000 a month. When she raised the issue her salary was adjusted to achieve parity.\nThe story was published days after more than two dozen staff members from his 2016 presidential campaign signed a letter seeking a meeting with the senator and his top advisers to address the issue of \u201csexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign, for the purpose of planning to mitigate the issue in the upcoming presidential cycle\u201d, according to Politico, which obtained a copy of the letter.\nAsked during an interview on CNN if he was aware of the claims at the time, Sanders replied that he was not.\n\u201cI was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case,\u201d he said.\nSen. @BernieSanders tells @andersoncooper he had no knowledge of allegations of sexual harassment and pay discrimination against women in his campaign organization during his 2016 bid for the White House, adding, \"of course, if I run [again], we will do better next time.\" pic.twitter.com/2tPlmiYfB3\nThe allegations are surfacing as the Vermont senator weighs a second run for the White House. Some former female staffers say the claims raise questions about whether he is the right candidate to lead the Democrats in the era of #MeToo and after a historic number of female candidates helped propel the party to power in the House of Representatives.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I\u2019m hearing from now that women felt disrespected, that there was sexual harassment that was not dealt with as effectively as possible,\u201d Sanders said. He added that the early days of the campaign were chaotic, as the operation scaled rapidly from a handful of paid staffers to more than a thousand.\nSanders pointed to new policies implemented during his 2018 re-election campaign for Senate that included a hotline run by an independent firm to report incidents of sexual harassment and discrimination and mandatory training for staff and volunteers \u2013 measures he described as the \u201cgold standard for what we should be doing\u201d.",

You just throw some ingredients into a pot. I don\u2019t get what\u2019s delicious about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf hotpot fandom continues to grow, you\u2019ll see fewer and fewer chefs in the years to come.\u201d\nHotpot is a popular Chinese dish that is eaten communally, with people putting raw meat, vegetables and noodles into a shared pot of hot seasoned broth. Eating hotpot is often a social occasion, with groups gathering around and eating from the same pot.\nChua\u2019s comments about the beloved dish prompted shocked reactions among the other panellists, one of whom said \u201cMany people love hotpot!\u201d\nResponding on Chinese social media, many viewers were outraged by the attack on the dish, with one saying: \u201cChinese hotpot has an abundance of cultural significance, from its broth to the order that you put ingredients into various sauces. Trashing hotpot exposed your ignorance and your inability to discover cultural details in things.\u201d\nAnother suggested that Chua \u201cnever had a good hotpot. I feel sorry for him.\u201d\nHotpot was the subject of controversy earlier in the week when Australian metalcore guitarist and vegan advocate Jona Weinhofen tweeted a picture of hotpot saying \u201cMeat eaters be like \u2018vegan food looks and tastes gross\u2019 And then eat something that looks like leftover dishwater.\u201d\nMeat eaters be like \u201cvegan food looks and tastes gross\u201dAnd then eat something that looks like leftover dishwater pic.twitter.com/QtaEU9zNyl\nWeinhofen\u2019s tweet was criticised for its cultural insensitivity and for not acknowledging that hotpot can be made from entirely vegan ingredients, and for being classist, as hotpot developed as a way for working class people to make their supply of meat and vegetables stretch further.\nJeff Yang, an American columnist, wrote that Weinhofen\u2019s comment was an example of \u201cneocolonialist\u201d beliefs about food.\n\u201cCan we talk about white veganism for a second? The kind espoused by folks like Jona here, who begins his Twitter bio with the Sanskrit word for \u2018nonviolence\u2019 but then craps on Asian cultural expressions in order to advance his neocolonial beliefs?\u201d he wrote.",

        "content": "US could withdraw from a second treaty while Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia promises a new generation of nuclear weapons\nThe decision on whether or not to destroy the world came down to a humble Soviet duty officer early one morning in 1983. Stanislav Petrov was told by his computer that the United States had launched at least five intercontinental ballistic missiles at the Soviet Union, and that they would strike in just 25 minutes.\nRather than send the alarm up the chain of command, the lieutenant colonel did nothing and averted a nuclear clash over what turned out to be a systems malfunction. For his troubles, Petrov was reprimanded for failing to keep careful notes during the incident and left the service the following year.\nHe died at 77 just last year, on the cusp of the collapse of the architecture that has governed nuclear arms control for the last two generations. Potential nuclear clashes may seem the stuff of Cold War lore, but the framework to prevent them is recent and increasingly endangered.\nLed by National Security Advisor John Bolton, the United States in 2018 said it would leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the 1987 nuclear arms control treaty largely credited with keeping nuclear weapons out of Europe. That came after years of complaints about Russia testing a ground-based cruise missile that violated the treaty.\nThe next pillar to fall could be the New Start treaty, signed by Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in 2010, which reduced strategic missile launchers by half. That treaty will expire in 2021 unless it is extended, and President Trump has called it a \u201cbad deal\u201d in a telephone call with Vladimir Putin.\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister has said he believes the United States is \u201cpreparing the soil to dismantle this deal.\u201d\nPutin also threatened the United States with a new line of nuclear-capable weapons earlier this year, blaming the United States\u2019 decision to exit the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty for a new arms race. His state of the nation speech, usually a staid affair, was accompanied by a low-resolution animation of a nuclear-powered cruise missile sailing from the Atlantic Ocean, around Cape Horn and then northward toward California.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to our country then,\u201d Putin said of the US leaving the ABM in 2001. \u201cListen to us now.\u201d\nTaken together, these treaties are the bulk of the nuclear arms control framework that the United States and Russia inherited from the Cold War or have developed since. Experts from both sides note that the treaties weren\u2019t perfect but warn that brokering deals is far more difficult than breaking them. The probability of an arms buildup is growing.\n\u201cThe INF decision and failure to get into real discussions about extending New START has us sleepwalking into a new nuclear arms race,\u201d said Richard Burt, a former ambassador who served as chief negotiator for the United States on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, during an Atlantic Council event earlier this year.\nViktor Yesin, the former chief of staff of the Russian Federation Strategic Missile Force, said that the US decision to exit the INF was largely with an eye to military developments in China and other countries not bound by the treaty. But the decision could lead to deployments of missiles in Europe, he said, unless the United States and Russia take steps to avoid it.\nOnly \u201cpolitical measures\u201d could avert \u201cthe worst outcome for Russia and Europe in the development of a \u2018missile crisis,\u2019 which will unavoidably arise after the United States exits the INF,\u201d he said.\nThose warnings appear to be apt. A leaked memo published by the Washington Post showed that Bolton had ordered the Pentagon to \u201cdevelop and deploy ground-launched missiles at the earliest possible date.\u201d The order was tabled only after European allies intervened to prevent an immediate US pullout from the INF. Washington has issued Moscow a 60-day ultimatum, after which it will exit the treaty. Russia, which has not admitted to violating the treaty, has signalled it won\u2019t change its behaviour.\nThe driving force behind the pullout is seen as Bolton, who has spoken fervently against similar arms control treaties and presided over the demolition of both the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2001 and now the INF.\nDetermined individuals can change the course of history. In 1983, Petrov\u2019s decision not to alert his superiors came down to a \u201cfunny feeling in my gut.\u201d Now, Bolton appears resolved to finally see a United States released from the bonds of missile treaties and nuclear arms control.",

        "content": "The writer Carl Honor\u00e9 used to think of ageing as a \u2018chamber of horrors\u2019. Now he argues we are in a \u2018golden age\u2019 for older people\nRead inspiring stories of four of Carl Honor\u00e9\u2019s \u2018ageing heroes\u2019\nThree years ago, Carl Honor\u00e9, the journalist whose series of books, starting with In Praise of Slow in 2004, has made him the guru of slow living, had an epiphany. Like a true Canadian, though one born in Scotland and domiciled in London, he adores ice hockey, and still plays hard and fast at the age of 51. But one day, at a tournament in Gateshead, someone pointed out that he was the oldest player among the 240 competitors. \u201cI knew that I was one of the oldest, but being told in such raw terms that I was the oldest \u2013 it just shook me. It knocked me for six in a way that shocked me.\u201d\nHonor\u00e9 was 48 at the time, \u201cthe big 50\u201d was looming, and what he calls \u201cthe terrible weight of the number\u201d started dragging him down. Was ageing really going to be as bad as everyone said? Was all he had to look forward to now decline, decrepitude and death? On the train back to London, as his team-mates knocked back the beers, he decided to embark on a book on the subject.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found with all my books that they start with what is almost an out-of-body experience when I see myself in sharp relief from the side,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI needed to understand my own relationship with the number, with what ageing means, and where I was going to be in 10 or 20 years.\u201d The result is B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives \u2013 a call for society to become less ageist and for individuals to stop worrying about the process of ageing and wring every drop out of whatever time is allotted to us.\nHonor\u00e9 has travelled the world in search of active, high-achieving older people, but he stresses that he doesn\u2019t want to hold the \u201coutliers\u201d up as the norm. He is more interested in a state of mind in which the average 70- and 80-year-old goes on working if they want to, volunteering, starting their own enterprises, playing competitive sport, having great sex \u2013 and society doesn\u2019t bat an eye. It is ageist, he argues, to stop people being able to do those things; but it\u2019s also ageist to make a big deal of it. Still having sex at 80, still making TV programmes at 90, even running marathons at 100? Why shouldn\u2019t they be?\nThe conclusion Honor\u00e9 came to, after three years of research and an examination of the way older people are treated around the world, was that it was in many ways a golden age for \u201cthe old\u201d (a term he would never use): there were more of them, they were healthier, more active and many were better off than in previous generations. They could no longer be ignored or marginalised. But, in his view, that is just a beginning. \u201cIt can be so much better,\u201d he says, \u201cif we move a lot of goalposts and change the way everything from healthcare to politics to the business world to education is organised.\u201d He argues that the idea of being educated between the ages of five and 21, working for 40 years and then retiring on a pension at 60 is completely out of date, imagining a much more fluid way of life where we dip in and out of education and the job market and never formally \u201cretire\u201d.\nI ask Honor\u00e9 at what age we become \u201cold\u201d. He refuses to supply a number. \u201cI use the word \u2018older\u2019 in a very elastic way,\u201d he says. \u201cThe definition is so fluid, and to box people in and say: \u2018This is old\u2019 narrows horizons. What do we gain by saying: \u2018This person is old\u2019?\u201d He believes ageism is lessening but remains endemic. In fact, he says that when he began the book he was one of its worst proponents. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was so ageist. I had a dread of growing old. I had bought into that idea that you hit 35 and it\u2019s just a downward spiral. I used to think of old people as just sad and cantankerous. But, if you look at the stats, the people with the highest levels of happiness and life satisfaction in Britain are the over-60s. That doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that many people will be very unhappy, but the story we are told and that we tell ourselves is that everyone is unhappy. It\u2019s always the worst-case scenario: that\u2019s what we are contaminated by.\u201d\nHonor\u00e9 no longer frets about ageing. \u201cMy biggest worry was that I would end up in a gloomy place,\u201d he says, \u201cbut, thankfully, the opposite is true \u2013 I feel so much more optimistic now than I did when I embarked on the book. We have created a culture where ageing is seen as a chamber of horrors. There is no chink of light in it. I suspected that was not true, and along the way I found it to be utterly untrue.\u201d\nB(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives is published by Simon & Schuster (\u00a316.99)\n1. If you think of yourself as old, you will be old. The media will bang on about dementia and loneliness, but ignore them. Concentrate on the upside.\n2. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Resist being pigeonholed; keep experimenting; challenge yourself and society\u2019s stereotyping of you.\n3. Try to stay healthy. Eat well and take lots of exercise \u2013 it\u2019s good for brain and body. Exercise doesn\u2019t have to mean playing competitive ice hockey; the odd brisk walk will keep you in shape.\n4. Look for positive role models. Helen Mirren, David Attenborough and, best of all, Michelangelo, who lived until the ripe old age (in 16th-century terms) of 88 and spent the final 20 years of his life designing and overseeing the construction of St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome. Now that\u2019s a way to go out.\n5. Seek to become the person you always wanted to be. One reason many people are at their happiest in their 60s is that they feel freer and less beholden to others. They contain all their previous selves and can start to make sense of them.\n6. Don\u2019t just maintain social connections with your own age group: mix across the generations as much as you can. Inter-generational contact has become increasingly difficult, but if we can do it we benefit \u2013 and society benefits.\n7. Be willing to let stuff go. If that friendship isn\u2019t working, drop it. Streamline your life. There is less time left, so make it count.\n8. Ageing should be a process of opening rather than closing doors. \u201cWe will lose some things \u2013 speed, stamina, a bit of mental agility \u2013 but in many other respects we gain,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. We learn new skills, have greater social awareness, are likely to be more altruistic, are \u201clighter\u201d in our approach to life \u2013 because we are less hung up on creating a good impression \u2013 and can see the bigger picture. It may be that we are in a position to make a greater contribution to society in our 60s and 70s than in our so-called prime.\n9. Honesty is the best policy. Don\u2019t try to pretend you are not 75 or 85 or whatever age you are. \u201cAs soon as we start lying about our age, we\u2019re giving the number a terrible power \u2013 a power it doesn\u2019t deserve,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. People do it because there are so many ageist assumptions attached to age, but the way to fight back is to subvert those assumptions.\n10. Society tells us that sex, love and romance belong to the young, but it\u2019s not true. Plenty of older people continue to experience the joy of sex. But there are no rules: have as much \u2013 or as little \u2013 as you want. Some older people see it as a blessed release to escape the shackles of falling in love (and lust), but others can\u2019t imagine life without it. Whatever turns you on.\n11. Ignore people who say you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks. You can. Despite the common perception that creativity is the preserve of the young, we can get more creative as we get older. Our neural networks loosen up and we have the confidence and freedom to challenge groupthink. Honor\u00e9 was encouraged last year when the Turner prize abolished its age limit for artists. Michelangelo could have been a contender.\n12. Don\u2019t pretend death isn\u2019t coming. Embrace it \u2013 just not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to know our lives are bookended,\u201d says Honor\u00e9. \u201cWhen time is running out, it becomes more precious. It gives life shape and, in some ways, meaning.\u201d Don\u2019t dwell morbidly on it, but don\u2019t shy away from it either. The closer you get to it, the less you are likely to fear it and the greater your focus will be on the things that really matter.",

        "content": "A daughter\u2019s life is shaped by her father\u2019s arrogance and her mother\u2019s humility, in Catherine Corsini\u2019s beautiful film\nIs there any other kind? The villain of this film actually specifies three kinds of love: marital, passionate and lastly \u201cinevitable\u201d \u2013 the kind that supposedly lands arbitrarily on everyone once, and in such a way that the man involved can\u2019t possibly be expected to absorb its consequences into his life. To these, Catherine Corsini\u2019s movie adds two more: the love of a daughter for her mother and for her father. But impossibility is what all five have in common: the authentic ingredient.\nThis is a mother-daughter story with the erotic intensity of a love story and the pathos of a coming-of-ager \u2013 though darker, messier and more unresolved than is traditional. It is based on the 2015 novel by French author and screenwriter Christine Angot (the co-author of Claire Denis\u2019s recent film Let the Sunshine In), which is in turn avowedly based on her own upbringing in Ch\u00e2teauroux in central France, returning the writer to the personal theme which has long haunted her: emotional cruelty and abuse.\nThe Belgian actor Virginie Efira (last seen in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle and the Netflix comedy Call My Agent!) gives a superbly intelligent and sympathetic performance as Rachel, a young woman from a Jewish background in 1950s France, working as a secretary and living at home with her mum and sister, her dad having long since fled. She is very beautiful in her shy, unassuming and uncomplicated way, but with self-esteem issues connected with the failure of a relationship and worries about being left on the shelf.\nThe very worst kind of man she could fall for now is the one who, naturally, dazzles her, and this is Philippe, played by Niels Schneider, a smoothly handsome, charismatic and educated guy with a creepily conceited way of saying how he doesn\u2019t want commitment or marriage because of course he can\u2019t be tied down. He gives her two books by his favourite author \u2013 Friedrich Nietzsche. It is a sign of how very insufferable he is to become. When Rachel becomes pregnant, Philippe effectively disappears, turning his former lover into a single mother. It is Rachel\u2019s lifelong mission as their daughter grows up simply to make Philippe acknowledge his fatherhood legally. Their daughter Chantal is played by Estelle Lescure as a teenager and by Jehnny Beth as a young woman. Finally, Philippe consents to be a part of Chantal\u2019s life, and this is a catastrophe.\nEfira shows how Rachel\u2019s humility and acceptance amount to a kind of self-abasement and self-harm. She is like one of the young mothers that Philip Larkin sees in the children\u2019s playground in his poem Afternoons: \u201cSomething is pushing them / To the side of their own lives.\u201d As for Philippe, he is simply intolerable, and Schneider shows how he is arrogant, supercilious, casually antisemitic, with a way of making it clear that Rachel\u2019s needs are not important. At one stage, he even says he can\u2019t help her and Chantal \u201cbecause my life takes up so much of my time\u201d. Tellingly, when they are reunited after a while apart, he saunters up with his hands in his pockets, as if hugging Rachel is something that hasn\u2019t immediately occurred to him.\nI felt like reaching into the screen and strangling him \u2013 and then grabbing Rachel by the shoulders and shaking her for putting up with it. Which is how the film gets you to understand some of what Chantal is going through. Because she is seduced by him in very much the same way, thrilled by his flattering attentions and his interest in her education, talking to her about books and art. And poor Rachel, with her inferiority complex, simply accepts that this is what is going to happen. Perhaps she thinks that Chantal has somehow inherited her ex-lover\u2019s callousness and there is nothing to be done. She has tragically misread the situation and when she shyly starts having a friendship with a new man, Franck (Ga\u00ebl Kamilindi), an even greater emotional humiliation is in store.\nCorsini is a film-maker who has always been drawn to the themes of female sexuality and the challenge and transgression that it represents. This is her best picture so far. She invests the relationship between Chantal and Rachel with enormous power and their final encounter is almost unbearably emotional. Chantal learns that some kinds of love are possible after all.",

        "content": "Exclusive: Fixing 396 pieces in Government Art Collection cost \u00a3212,871 in two years\n Hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money has been spent repairing artworks owned by the government that were damaged or needed restoration.\nRestorers were called in to fix 396 pieces in the government\u2019s art collection in two years, according to figures obtained by the Guardian using freedom of information laws.\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said \u00a3212,871 had been spent repairing artworks since 2016.\nThe Government Art Collection, which was established in 1898, includes a selection of historical, modern and contemporary British art that is on display in Whitehall and at government-owned residences around the world.\nDamaged artworks included a bust of the 19th-century author and politician Sir George Cornewall Lewis by the artist William Meredyth Thomas that was smashed by a transport company and then reconstructed at a cost of \u00a33,750 in 2017. Months earlier, it had been cleaned and waxed at a cost of \u00a3350.\nThe bust is now on display in 11 Downing Street and the DCMS said it no longer uses the company responsible for the damage.\nAn artwork called Mobile Reflector by Kenneth Martin, in which geometric plates are suspended and balanced from rods, cost \u00a31,200 to fix in 2017 after an element of the sculpture was bent.\nThe DCMS said the damage was caused when a mobile element was \u201cdislodged by breeze while room not in use\u201d. It is on display at 100 Parliament Street, which houses DCMS and HMRC staff.\nRobert Adams\u2019 steel sculpture Tall Spike Form, which is on display in Islamabad, Pakistan, cost \u00a3720 to fix after it was damaged in 2017 when a part of it broke off after a fall. It is not known who caused the damage.\nSeveral artworks were damaged when protesters in the Iranian capital, Tehran, stormed into the UK embassy in 2011 to demonstrate against sanctions imposed by Britain. Student protesters ransacked offices, smashed embassy windows and burned the union jack.\nThe damage to individual pieces ran into the tens of thousands of pounds. More than \u00a316,000 was spent last year on a tear repair and \u201crelining, cleaning, filling, retouching\u201d an oil painting of Fath \u2018Ali Shah, the second Qajar shah of Iran, by the artist Ahmad.\nAnother \u00a311,000 was spent on the \u201cgeneral conservation\u201d of an Iranian oil painting of \u201cYusuf on the throne with servants and officials\u201d, which involved \u201ctear repair, relining, cleaning, retouching\u201d.\nA further \u00a38,080 was spent cleaning, relining, filling and retouching an Iranian oil painting of a \u201clady playing a stringed instrument\u201d.\nThe government is in the process of trying to recoup the repair costs of the Iranian artworks as part of a larger compensation claim being made to the government in Tehran by the Foreign Office.\nMeanwhile, \u00a37,380 was spent on the artist Sir Godfrey Kneller\u2019s oil painting of King George I to clean, reline, fill and retouch the artwork as part of its \u201cgeneral conservation\u201d last year.\nThe Government Art Collection regularly lends works to public exhibitions and runs tours of its central London building. Michael Daley, the director of ArtWatch UK, which campaigns to protect the integrity of art from \u201cphysical treatments and hazardous, exploitative or demeaning actions\u201d, warned increasing pressure on cash-strapped museums and galleries to up the number of displays potentially put artworks at risk.\n\u201cThere should generally be more attention given to the welfare of the art and also to the welfare of people who just want to go and see the artwork there is,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of artwork in Britain and it\u2019s all been churned more and more. You don\u2019t know quite what you\u2019ll see when you go into a museum. Museum directors are being driven to increase audiences all the time.\n\u201cThere are all sorts of pressures on the museums and they can\u2019t really cope given the objects are fragile, vulnerable, very often old and very often need to be as little disturbed as possible. There\u2019s a conflict and it\u2019s being fuelled by all sorts of pressures \u2013 government pressures, political pressures, commercial pressures. The government is giving less to museums, so museums are having to be more resourceful.\u201d\nA DCMS spokesman said: \u201cThe Government Art Collection helps to promote British art, culture and history around the world and contributes to our cultural diplomacy. With nearly 10,000 objects on display in over 200 countries, it is uniquely wide-ranging.\n\u201cWe take its conservation very seriously and use a range of preventative measures. While the majority of treatments are due to gradual deterioration, a proportion of recent costs are due to conservation following long-term display and several artworks damaged in the 2011 attack on the British embassy in Tehran.\u201d\nThe Iranian artworks had now been restored and were to be returned to Iran, the spokesman added.",

Now it\u2019s owned by a group of people who want to be frozen cryogenically and live for ever\u2019 \nFor the last five years I\u2019ve kept a list of dream locations to photograph and this was one of them. It\u2019s an underground house in Las Vegas that has its own garden with fake trees, fake sunrises and fake scenery. It went on the market in 2014, and when I spotted it it had been sold for $1m to a \u201cmystery group\u201d. I managed to track down the owners to ask if they\u2019d let me shoot there. Luckily, they were up for it.\nThe house was built as a bomb shelter in 1978 by Girard Henderson, a director of Avon cosmetics, and his wife, Mary, who was a hairdresser to the stars. They were both in their 70s at the time. It was the age of nuclear terror and the cold war. Maybe they wanted to go out in style?\nI knew from photos that the house would fit my aesthetic: my locations tend to be pink, quite kitsch, with a sense of the 60s and 70s being preserved. When I got there, though, it was so much bigger than I imagined. You can get lost in it. There are lots of different entrances and exits and it took me a while to work out my bearings. It\u2019s also really quiet. You can hear the swimming pool trickling in the background and these occasional strange, creaky noises \u2026 but there\u2019s no sound at all from the real world above ground.\nI really had to push myself to stay for three nights because it was quite a scary place to be on your own. It felt like an empty museum \u2013 or a mausoleum! But I always work alone on my projects. If anyone else is there, I\u2019d just be thinking and worrying: \u201cAre they bored? What do they think of me?\u201d I need to remove from the situation anything that makes me self-conscious.\nThe way I work is to set up the camera for each shot first, to make everything perfect composition-wise. Then I get in front of the camera and shoot myself with an infrared remote control. This picture, of my legs, came after I\u2019d tried a million different poses. I ended up lying down because I was so frustrated and getting to the point of giving up. I was thinking: \u201cWhat am I doing taking stupid pictures of myself in this house when all my friends are back in the UK having fun?\u201d But this pose worked. It\u2019s kind of ambiguous. It could be looked at as highly sexual, but it also reminds me of someone giving birth. I like the way the pose matches the curtains opening \u2013 I\u2019m into cliches like that. It also has a Hitchcock Rear Window element, as if I\u2019m peeking in on myself from the garden.\nIt turned out the \u201cmystery group\u201d who bought the house was a society of people who wanted to live for ever. They have all signed up to be frozen cryogenically when they die and I think they just wanted a quirky place for their headquarters. I explained to one of them what I was doing and they said it was fine as long as I made a donation. They\u2019d left a whole archive library of cryonics magazines in the house and I think that influenced these images. They ended up being snapshots of a woman trapped underground, a Stepford Wives type trying to preserve everything perfectly and slowly going mad and morphing into an alien. That wasn\u2019t the plan when I got there, because I never arrive with a plan \u2013 it all just happens on instinct.\nGirard died of a heart attack in 1983. As soon as that happened, his wife thought: \u201cI can\u2019t do this any more\u201d and moved back above ground. I don\u2019t blame her.

The weaker pound has made it less attractive for foreign nationals to come to Britain to work, while Brexit has also raised the prospect of tougher immigration rules in future.\nThe BCC said the economy also appeared to be \u201cstuck in a weak holding pattern\u201d at the start of the year owing to Brexit uncertainty, with companies reporting stagnant levels of growth and faltering business confidence.\nWhile manufacturers are coming under pressure from labour shortages, the service sector, which includes banks, hotels and restaurants, and accounts for about four-fifths of the economy, reported weaker domestic sales.\nProduction in the manufacturing sector hit its fastest pace of growth in six months in December as firms stockpiled in preparation for potential border holdups in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nThe IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose from 53.6 in November to 54.2 last month, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Above 50 indicates economic growth.\nThe latest snapshot raises the prospect that Brexit uncertainty may perversely benefit the economy in the short-term by prompting companies to raise their activity levels in preparation for potential disruption from the UK leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal.\nThe Bank of England has previously said that the majority of businesses in Britain have done little to prepare for a no-deal scenario, while the government has started to tell more companies to make preparations as it steps up its plans.\nEconomists, however, said the growth in activity was likely to be temporary. Disruption after 29 March could curtail activity, while any removal of Brexit risks could lead businesses to run down their stockpiled goods rather than placing new orders.",

He reported the incident to police 35 minutes after it happened.\nThe case was heard by a visiting magistrate from New South Wales and no criminal conviction was recorded.\nPithouse was appointed to the bench in 2008 and has attracted both criticism and some formal complaints over his 10-year career, including for his refusal in 2010 to hear a victim impact statement from a sexual assault victim, and for reportedly saying of a domestic violence victim in 2017 \u2013 who declined to make a sworn statement against her abuser \u2013 that it was \u201cher right to be beaten up if she wants to, I suppose\u201d.",

Bound in red leather embossed with gold, the world\u2019s smallest edition of Dante\u2019s classic poem, which was printed by the Salmin Brothers in Padua, is one of almost 50 officially designated miniature books housed in the London Library. Nomenclature is important here: according to the US-based Miniature Book Society, a miniature book \u201cis no more than three inches in height, width, or thickness\u201d, and while the London Library has some 350-odd \u201csmall\u201d books, of less than five inches, it has only 47 true miniatures. The library decided they were being overshadowed by their larger cousins, so now they are gathered together in a glass-fronted cabinet.\nAlongside the Dante, there is the smallest AuthorisedVersion of the Bible, first printed by David Bryce of Glasgow in 1896. Bryce said that when he \u201cdescended to the miniature, mite and midget size\u201d he had \u201cmany a scoff and jeer as to the absurdity of the production\u201d. This edition of the Bible, just an inch across, comes with a tiny magnifying glass tucked into a pocked in its cover (unlike the Dante, which is small but perfectly legible, this book would be impossible to read without one). There is also a miniature edition of Kate Greenaway\u2019s Alphabet from the 1880s, and Dunia Garcia-Ontiveros, who looks after the London Library\u2019s collection, points to the 1828 edition of Horace\u2019s odes, the second book to be published using Henri Didot\u2019s microscopic type. In a display of virtuosity, the text also contains a number of ornamental lines, the centre of which is formed by the letters \u201cHenri Didot\u201d printed even smaller than the type of the main text. I peer over the pages attempting to spot these; at last, using the zoom function on my phone, I find them.\n\u201cIn its quality, it\u2019s unparallelled,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros. \u201cHe\u2019s showing off. It was published in the 1820s, that\u2019s quite early. I\u2019m not surprised people called it a miracle.\u201d\nThe earliest miniature books in the collection date to the 16th century. Books were often made small, according to Garcia-Ontiveros, because they were religious texts \u2013 so people wanted to keep them close as they felt emotionally connected to them \u2013 or because they were controversial and had \u201cto be secreted about one\u2019s person\u201d, such as Charles Knowlton\u2019s 1832 guide to birth control, The Fruits of Philosophy.\nBut miniature books have a much longer history. The British Library points to two small cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia. Both concerned with trading information about animals and provisions, one is dated to around 2325BC and measures 15/8 by 11/2 inches; the other is dated 2200BC and measures 17/8 by 11/4 inches. In AD770, the Japanese empress Shotoku gave orders for the printing of 1m copies of a prayer scroll a mere 23/8 inches tall, the D\u2019harani prayer. These writings were made miniature, writes the British Library\u2019s Annalisa Ricciardi, \u201cso that men and women of faith could easily bring with them their collection of psalms and devotional books, students could carry their small library in a pocket, smugglers of ideas could easily hide tiny booklets in a secret bottom of their cape, merchants could quickly retrieve from their belt a tiny but complete guide on the equivalence of grains prices, scales, measures and conversion, and foreign currencies value meanwhile closing a deal, or sharp businessmen could brilliantly define a legal contract\u201d.\nTechnological developments in the 1800s made it possible to print text even more. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get the truly mind-bogglingly tiny books,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros, citing everything from the Horace to Bryce\u2019s Bible to a complete set of Shakespeare\u2019s plays that can be held cupped in two hands.\nSimon Garfield, who recently published In Miniature: How Small Things Illuminate the World, says his favourite is the Sherlock Holmes story How Watson Learned the Trick, which was written in the 1920s by Arthur Conan Doyle. \u201cIt\u2019s bound in red leather, measures under 4cm by 3cm and contains 503 words. That\u2019s about one page of a regular book, but it\u2019s handwritten and extends to 34 pages,\u201d says Garfield. (The original can be found in Queen Mary\u2019s Dolls\u2019 House in Windsor Castle.) \u201cThe title\u2019s ironic: the story, composed almost entirely of dialogue, begins with Watson thinking he\u2019s mastered the art of elementary detection, only to be deflated by Holmes proving him wrong on every count.\u201d\nAround the world, collectors coo over the Salmin Brothers\u2019 1896 copy of Galileo\u2019s 1636 letter to his friend Cristina di Lorena, which Louis Bondy writes in his history of miniature books \u201cwas considered the smallest printed from movable type\u201d for many years: it is half the size of a postage stamp. A copy is in MIT Libraries, in Massachusetts, alongside a handful of other miniatures: four addresses by Abraham Lincoln and extracts from Calvin Coolidge\u2019s autobiography. Both are as small as the Galileo, but neither were set from movable type. The National Library of Scotland has one of Bryce\u2019s most famous publications, a miniature Koran printed in Arabic around 1900, copies of which, it says, were often given to Muslim soldiers fighting with allied forces during the first world war, the metal locket allowing it \u201cto be easily worn around the neck of the soldier\u201d.\n\u201cThe 19th century was absolutely the golden age, the heyday of miniature printing,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros. \u201cThey were saying, we want to push this to the limit and see how far we can go.\u201d\nThose limits have gone from inches to millimetres to micrometres. In 1952, a Munich publisher produced a five-by-five millimetre book containing the Lord\u2019s Prayer in Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Swedish (it sold for \u00a31,300 in London in 2006). Guinness World Records lists the smallest reproduction of a printed book as Teeny Ted from Turnip Town, which measures 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres and was etched using an ion beam. Russian scientist Vladimir Aniskin believes he has beaten this with Levsha, his 70-by-90 micrometres book. The pages are turned using a sharpened metal needle.\nWhat is it that makes the world of the miniature so appealing? \u201cIt\u2019s the feeling that you can hold the entire works of Shakespeare in your hands,\u201d says Garcia-Ontiveros. \u201cMiniature books were never seen as serious books, they were curiosities, seen as fun objects, not the kind of books that would make it into libraries. They were the books people would have at home, and because they are tiny and often printed on cheap paper they don\u2019t tend to survive, so in any age miniature books are very rare. And they get lost! We ourselves had one fall behind a cabinet and it wasn\u2019t until we had some building work done that one of the builders saw it behind a cabinet. We\u2019d been looking for it for years.\u201d\nFor Garfield, it is less about content and more about the skill that went into making them at all. \u201cTheir size ensures that the reader takes great care in handling and appreciating them. This is the trick of so many miniature objects,\u201d he says. \u201cThe smaller they are, the more one looks.\u201d",

From the top of the Valmalenco cable car we followed snow trails through the woods to the enchanting Lago Pal\u00f9, where we walked across the frozen lake to a little igloo with ice table and stools. Fifteen minutes further on we reached the cosy Rifugio Pal\u00f9 overlooking the lake below, where we stopped for a hearty lunch in the sunshine before jumping aboard its motor-sledge, which whisked us back to the cable car station. All three generations enjoyed the winter adventure.Martha Hales\nHaving no skiing skills, the best fun I ever had was snow tubing in Kyrgyzstan. The resort, Kashka Suu, a short drive from the capital, Bishkek, is not busy, has beautiful powdery snow and offers great runs for the whole family. The hotel is warm and the food wholesome. We went as a group of families and had a wonderful weekend under blue skies, whizzing down slopes in inner tubes, which the resort provided. And from \u00a325 a night it offers great value for money. Karen\nThe Roc\u2019n Bob in Les Menuires, part of the Trois Vall\u00e9es, is a 4km tobogganing run. The price includes use of the cable car that takes you to the top of the course, where you will pick up your toboggan, equipped with brakes used for slowing down and steering your way around the course. There are breathtaking views as you skid and slide around multiple turns and banks. Despite the three valleys being notoriously expensive, at just \u20ac11 a run (\u20ac40 for family of four) this is great value for money.\n en.lesmenuires.comJameele\nAndorra has some great cheap skiing (Arinsal) and eating (oh my, the croquetas at Bar Xenius in Sant Juli\u00e0) but if you fancy something different in the snow, there are 90-minute igloo-building classes (rewarding but knackering), ski-biking, indoor ice go-karting, tubing, a speedy zipline over a frozen lake, and an epic toboggan-style rollercoaster, Tobotronc, dodging through the snow-covered pine forest for over 5km (from \u20ac8). Many of the activities operate after dark, too.Antony T\nSaariselk\u00e4 in Finnish Lapland is superb for all kinds of winter adventures. With 200km of ski trails (30km floodlit for short winter days), some running into Urho Kekkonen national park, and snowshoeing hikes, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to explore the fells (an Old Norse word, so not just for northern England), where you might spot reindeer, red squirrels, golden eagles and wolverine tracks. Dogsledding, snowmobiles, reindeer-drawn sleds, and the longest toboggan run (adults \u20ac25, including skating and snow-tubing) in the country are the best ways of getting about. I took an ice-fishing trip (\u20ac80 including drinks, gear, transport) and caught some magnificent Arctic char, cooking them over a wood fire on the edge of the forest.Vicky Inglis\nThe Accursed Mountains form the border between Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro \u2013 a limestone bulk that glows white and blue on winter days. Snowshoeing is the way to go at a human pace to hear this landscape\u2019s human story \u2013 of inspiring adventures, such as the first Albanian woman to climb Everest, who formed the Butterfly Outdoor Adventure tour company that organises snowshoeing here (\u20ac200 for two days including guide, B&B, food and gear). Ancient stories of hospitality were shared with us during long evenings warmed by conversation, wood fires and raki brandy.Elizabeth\nThe Swiss paradise of the Engadin valley offers a host of snowy adventures and isn\u2019t so dear. The string of frozen lakes in the valley bottom are laced with walking trails; we love hiking there in the winter. Sils Maria is our favourite Engadin destination, a cute and ancient village backed by the romantic Val Fex, where there are plenty of winter hiking trails and a couple of lovely places to stop for hot chocolate or a meal. Braver souls than us can also enjoy the toboggan run that snakes down to the lakeshore at Sils.Matt Thurstan\nIn M\u00e9ribel, we noticed small children having a great time sledging down the nursery slope at the end of the day. After a few apr\u00e8s ski drinks, we thought we\u2019d like to try but didn\u2019t have a sledge. However, we found black poubelle (dustbin) liners. We stepped into the bags, made holes for our feet, pulled them up and off we set, haring down the slope at a rapid rate of knots. Having marched back up the slope, we formed a train \u2013 when we derailed, I laughed so much I nearly wet myself. What cheap fun entertainment.Helen\nJust before leaving for a family holiday to Colorado, my wife found she was three months pregnant. So instead of skiing, as planned, we rented snowshoes and hiked around the trails. We walked the Fraser River Trail and in the Arapaho national forest \u2013 true backcountry wonderland. It was all so scenic and picturesque, and pregnant woman-friendly. My retired parents, who are keen skiers, joined us instead of hitting the slopes that day, and snowshoeing was a revelation for them \u2013 the highlight of their trip.I Greig\nIt\u2019s almost a year away now, but it\u2019s well worth a trip in December to Austria\u2019s east Tirol to see Krampuslauf \u2013 a slightly scary tradition with pagan origins in which horned demons (krampus) run through the streets punishing those deemed naughty. In Matrei In Osttirol each year in early December a mad rush of Krampuses crash through the streets, driving all before them. Stay at Hotel Hinteregger (doubles from \u20ac90 B&B) and drink enough j\u00e4gertee (a rum/tea mix) to obliviate the pain if they catch you. The ski resort of Mallnitz, a 90-minute drive from Matrei, has a similar tradition called Perchten just after Christmas.Tylaar haran\nCamping in the snow is fine as long as you\u2019re warm. With lots of layers and lots of warm socks, a snowy break in Glen Nevis can be great fun. I have a butane gas heater and an air mattress, which helps. There\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a winter wonderland that you don\u2019t have to share with anyone you don\u2019t choose to.Sian Burns",

        "content": "Family of activist Amaya Eva Coppens, 24, appeal for help to \u2018stop the repression\u2019 of Nicaraguan government\nThe mother of a medical student facing more than 20 years in prison for protesting against the Nicaraguan government is appealing to the international community to put pressure on president Daniel Ortega\u2019s regime.\nAmaya Eva Coppens, a Belgian-Nicaraguan dual national, is due to stand trial in the capital Managua after being \u201cabducted\u201d in a raid by more than 30 riot police and paramilitaries on 10 September.\nThe 24-year-old activist, who had been studying in the city of Le\u00f3n, is among more than 600 political prisoners detained since April when the state reacted with violence to demonstrations against planned social security reforms.\nIn an emotional appeal, her mother Tamara Zamora told the Guardian: \u201cAmaya is a citizen of both Belgium and the European Union so I\u2019m calling on the international community to use their powers to apply political pressure.\n\u201cWe want to draw attention not only to Amaya\u2019s case, but to those of others who are less visible. We want other governments to demand an end to this dictatorship to stop the repression.\u201d\nDescribed by her family as \u201cpassionate and tenacious\u201d with a \u201cstrong social conscience\u201d, Coppens is facing charges of terrorism, possession of firearms and being an accomplice to the kidnapping of police officers. Others facing similar charges have been handed sentences of up to 30 years, according to human rights groups.\nCoppens was involved in the first protest on 18 April against Ortega\u2019s plan to reduce benefits for pensioners. The following day she was beaten by police but saved by her peers.\nShe went on to become a key figure in the student movement, attending to the injured and bringing food to protesters amid a violent clampdown during which snipers targeted demonstrators under what Amnesty International described as Ortega\u2019s shoot to kill strategy.\nSince May, Coppens had been moving between addresses. Her two brothers moved to Belgium amid fears for their safety, but she insisted on staying.\nZamora broke down in tears as she described the day her daughter was eventually tracked down.\n\u201cShe was at a safe house but someone had betrayed [her], reporting her location. About 30 men arrived in trucks and one put a gun to her head, saying: \u2018We\u2019ve finally got you\u2019.\u201d\nCoppens was taken to the El Chipote maximum security jail in Managua and held for eight days before being transferred to the La Esperanza prison for women.\n\u201cThe first time I was allowed to see her I felt completely heartbroken,\u201d said Zamora. \u201cI knew she was sad and could see the realisation in her face this was not going to be a short-term thing.\u201d\nThe parents\u2019 second visit was on their daughter\u2019s 24th birthday on 31 October. \u201cShe was in much better shape and told us she had been exercising and staying strong so she could continue the fight,\u201d her mother recalled.\nMore than 152,000 people have signed a petition to free Coppens and other political prisoners.\nZamora, whose husband is Belgian, said she thinks her daughter\u2019s status as a dual national has prevented her from being tortured like other detainees.\nBut she added: \u201cThe Belgian authorities haven\u2019t done much as there is no embassy in Nicaragua.\u201d The family was told by the consulate that assistance would be limited because only one parent is Belgian.\nLawyers for the family have warned them to expect a sentence \u201cin excess of 20 years\u201d when Coppens stands trial this year.\n\u201cThese are political trials,\u201d said Zamora. \u201cEven if you have the best lawyer in the world our kids will be found guilty and sentenced. The only way out of this is a change in government.\u201d\nThe husband of another detainee, 37-year-old dentist Irlanda Jerez, agreed.\nDaniel Esquivel said: \u201cIn terms of justice we have very little hope. The regime controls the judges and the legal system \u2013 it\u2019s a political issue and the only solution will be a political one.\u201d\nHe explained how charges brought against his wife were a smokescreen designed to silence her.\n\u201cShe did not have any trouble with the government prior to the protests but she\u2019s always had strong political opinions and started sharing these widely [on social media] after we became involved in the protests,\u201d said Esquivel.\nThe authorities soon began digging into her past to see what they could use to attack her, claims Esquivel. They found details of a property dispute in 2016 which Jerez won on appeal in the supreme court.\nSix vehicles surrounded her car in Managua on 18 July and Jerez was seized by armed police and subsequently charged in relation to the 2016 case. She was sentenced to five years in jail.\nEsquivel said the inmates continue the resistance from behind bars by singing the Nicaraguan national anthem and weaving blue and white wrist bands.\nBut he fears for his wife\u2019s safety. She was allegedly attacked on 26 October when 20 to 25 men wielding AK47s stormed the prison. It is understood they beat her after she refused to be taken for interrogation and many of her cellmates who tried to protect her were injured.\n\u201cWhen I saw her she had bruises on her back and limbs,\u201d said Esquivel. \u201cShe is usually optimistic but she\u2019s heard rumours they want to move her and says she is worried they want to \u2018make her disappear for good\u2019.\u201d\nCoppens\u2019 family, meanwhile, remain defiant as they await news of her trial which has been postponed until February.\nA Belgian foreign ministry spokesman said they were doing everything possible to support her case.\n\u201cOur embassy based in Panama has provided consular assistance from the beginning. We have been there at each stage of her case but because she is a dual national the assistance we can provide under international law is limited,\u201d said Matthieu Branders.\n\u201cWe cannot intervene on judicial matters but our minister met with the Nicaraguan minister for national affairs in September at the general assembly in New York, and asked that the investigation was conducted properly to ensure a speedy release.\u201d\nThe Nicaraguan government has not responded to a request for comment.",

Kauri is a member of the Manu Taupunga group that is the organising arm of the whale-body recovery operation started by his father\nConcrete information on why whales strand remains elusive, but \u201csickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather\u201d are all thought to contribute, according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation.\nClimate change is to blame too, scientists think, with warming ocean temperatures moving whales\u2019 prey closer to the shore and forcing them to pursue their food into shallow waters.\nClockwise from top: small whale bones; squid beaks, from the stomach of a sperm whale; the baleen filter-feeder system recovered from a stranded pygmy right whale.\nNovember marked the beginning of whale stranding season, and it started with a surge in incidents, according to whale rescue group Project Jonah, with 140 pilot whales beaching and dying on Stewart Island, 10 rare pygmy whales on Ninety Mile beach, 51 stranded and dead on the Chatham Islands and a spate of individual cases around the country.\nAnd as more whales beach and die \u2013 from exhaustion, heat stroke or seagulls feasting on their flesh \u2013 an acute sense of grief is growing among New Zealand\u2019s indigenous people, who regard whales as their ancestors and taonga (treasures).\n\u201cThese days it is like a zoo. People just want to come and gawk at us, without even trying to understand what is happening with the animals and the environment,\u201d says Parata, bristling with anger.\n\u201cWhen will we talk about what is hurting these animals out on the sea? They are drowning out there, they can\u2019t breathe, they beach themselves to be with the Aunties.\u201d\nNg\u0101tiwai believe the whales beach when they are ready to die and want to return to their families, the M\u0101ori people. Then, their human families use the whales\u2019 gift of their bodies for sacred carvings, for traditional medicines, and even for compost.\nThere are marked tribal differences across New Zealand and while some tribes work to refloat stranded whales, others like Parata\u2019s Ng\u0101tiwai stand back and allow the Department of Conservation and volunteer groups to take the lead in rescue efforts.\nThen the tribe moves in en masse and holds a karakia (prayer), names each animal and sets to work removing their bones, blubber, eyes and teeth for cultural purposes.\nBuck Cullen with his daughter Kaiarahi (10 months) in his backyard, where he is storing a pair of massive sperm whale jawbones. Cullen is an integral member of Hori Parata\u2019s whale recovery team\nBut indigenous elders say they aren\u2019t being listened to when they tell the government their whale kin are sick, and trying to escape an increasingly polluted and unpredictable ocean.\nEarlier this year in South Taranaki, a mass stranding that was described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d left the local M\u0101ori tribe scrambling. Security was brought in when thieves attacked a sperm whale with an axe, trying to remove valuable teeth from its jaw.\n12 par\u0101oa whales (sperm whales) recently stranded on the South Taranaki coast of Kaupokonui, on a scale not seen near this location in recent memory\nParata and his 22-year-old son, Te Kaurinui Robert Parata, were called in to assist. Te Kaurinui was called after the first whale his father ever named, and left university this year to return to Whang\u0101rei and study whale tikanga (protocol) and carving.\nHe says mass strandings are getting more local and international attention and money from donations, but traditional knowledge is being dismissed as overly spiritual.\nClockwise from top: Te Kaurinui Parata, in front of the carving shed at Hihiaua Cultural Centre in Whang\u0101rei; Parata holds three whale teeth recovered from a beached whale \u2013 the middle one shows marks where a poacher had attempted to hack it out with an axe before the recovery group arrived; the Pou, a tribal identifier, in front of the carving shed.\nM\u0101ori harvest rights over dead whales have only been officially recognised since 1998, and the practice still elicits horror from some New Zealanders and visitors.\n\u201cOur own ancestors wouldn\u2019t say to go down there and hug the whales. That\u2019s a modern thing,\u201d says Te Kaurinui.\nThe Ng\u0101tiwai are investigating a possible link between the crisis of the dieback disease killing New Zealand\u2019s native kauri trees \u2013 and threatening the giant T\u0101ne Mahuta, which may be 2,000 years old \u2013 and the increase in whale strandings.\nParata and his family believe whale oil and byproducts could be used to try to cure Kauri dieback, and want more government money and attention directed towards indigenous knowledge of the interconnectedness of the New Zealand environment, and possible indigenous solutions.\n\u201cPeople dismiss us when we tell them our spiritual understanding of whales \u2013 why they are beaching, why they are hurting,\u201d says Te Kaurinui.\nWhang\u0101rei Harbour seen from Tamaterau, with mangrove sprouts coming up through the harbourside silt\n\u201cWe are not foreigners in this land. We did not take this land off anyone else. We were not lost waiting for some bullheads to tell us what was going on.\u201d\nKaitaia conservation department ranger Jamie Werner of Ng\u0101tiwai recently attended his first mass beaching on Ninety Mile Beach. It was the first recorded time pygmy whales had stranded on New Zealand shores.\n\u201cI arrived at the beach and we leapfrogged between the animals. They were calling out to each other and reassuring each other,\u201d says Werner. \u201cIt was a shock. We\u2019re working to adapt but the ocean is changing so fast.\u201d\nAbove, the skull of a bryde\u2019s whale; right, a large-calibre bullet of the type that the New Zealand Department of Conservation uses for euthanasing stranded whales that are beyond rescue\nThe recent spate of mass strandings has been described as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d by the conservation department.\nBut for Parata and his family the slow, painful deaths of their ancestors are personal \u2013 and ultimately devastating \u2013 for the health of the tribe and the sea.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very emotional. Our ancestors tell us the strandings are a sign from the sea. So what is the sea telling us? We need to listen.\u201d",

In response to a fan\u2019s question about being compared to the Notorious BIG, Ginsburg humorously replies they have something in common, being both from Brooklyn. (However, she does not comment on the late rapper\u2019s lyrics \u2013 which include lines such as \u201cBitches I like \u2019em brainless\u201d \u2013 perhaps unwilling to be drawn into the \u201ccontext\u201d debate.)\nThis lively film tracks Ginsburg\u2019s brilliant legal career, fighting for women\u2019s workplace rights while shrewdly also taking on cases where men suffered discrimination. It pays a moving tribute to the important role played in Ginsburg\u2019s life by her devoted husband Marty, to whom she was married for over 50 years until his death. It also highlights her most compelling pronouncements, such as that in Shelby County v Holder in 2013, in which she argued that the regional protections of the Voting Rights Act in preventing race discrimination were still necessary even when they appeared to have been rendered obsolete by precisely those improved conditions they continue to maintain. Abolition was like \u201cthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet\u201d.\nBut for good or ill, the film does not directly engage with Ginsburg\u2019s views on contemporary feminism and sexual harassment and what is sometimes derisively called identity politics. It was made well before the appointment of the self-pitying and shrill Brett Kavanaugh to the bench \u2013 in comparison with whom Ginsburg looks even more like an intellectual giant \u2013 and so she could hardly be expected to comment on the Christine Blasey Ford case. But she serves alongside Clarence Thomas, whose denial of harassment allegations from Anita Hill at his own confirmation hearing in 1991 is a matter of public record.\nDid the film-makers consider it improper to ask Ginsburg anything at all about that? There is a strange silence \u2013 it would have been interesting, and highly relevant, to hear from Ginsburg in general terms about the legal implications of #MeToo.",

        "content": "Paul lives in a signal black spot where his wife\u2019s smartphone still works. Is there a way to find if phone has good reception?\nI have a Moto 3 smartphone and my wife has a similar earlier model. We are right on the edge of reception from EE. I can just get a very weak signal if I attach my phone to a selfie stick and lean out of a window, or walk up the bank behind the house. This is not ideal.\nAway from home, sometimes my wife\u2019s phone can get a strong signal whereas mine can\u2019t get a signal at all. This made me wonder if there was a measurement to assess how good a mobile phone is at receiving signals in areas of poor reception before you buy it \u2026 and if there is an easy way for an ordinary punter to understand it. Paul\nPhone manufacturers and others can and do test their phones, usually for certification purposes. The performance test results you want, if you can get them, are the Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) value for reception and the Total Radiated Power (TRP) for transmission.\nThese probably don\u2019t qualify as easy for an ordinary punter to understand. Also, they are derived by testing performance in ideal conditions with a simulated base station in an anechoic chamber, not with a fading signal on a wet and windy hillside.\nEither way, I don\u2019t think phone manufacturers are likely to use TIS in their marketing. There are too many variables for it to be a reliable guide to real-world reception. For example, studies have found significant differences between holding a phone in the left hand and holding it in the right hand, which I assume is connected with the way manufacturers position their antenna(s). The size of your hands and the angle at which you hold the phone also make a difference.\nThe tests were created by the CTIA \u2013 originally the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association \u2013 to certify wireless devices\u2019 over-the-air performance, and a brief glance at the 591-page PDF will show how complicated it is. For example, you could measure peak performance with a directional aerial, but then users would have to orient the phone towards the unseen transmitter for the best results. Instead, the CTIA requires the \u201caverage spherical effective radiated receiver sensitivity (TIS) to be measured\u201d. This should mean a phone works equally well in all directions, but it\u2019s complicated to calculate and still a compromise.\nAnother problem is making antennas work with different 2G, 3G and 4G phone networks that operate at different frequencies. A phone that works well with GSM 900 might be terrible with UMTS 2100. The downside of having a phone that talks to most networks is that it won\u2019t be optimised for the one you actually use.\nAlso, because human bodies have not been standardised, TIS and TRP measurements are made with dummy heads and hands filled with liquid. Results may vary if you use real people.\nIn the end, the only measurements that matter are the ones you get with your head and hands with the specific frequencies used by your EE network. We are left with \u201cask a friend\u201d and the not-very-helpful \u201ctry it and see\u201d.\nI couldn\u2019t find much public research into mobile phone reception with commercial phones, presumably because of some of the problems mentioned above. Professor Gert Fr\u00f8lund Pedersen tested nine phones in Denmark in 2012 (PDF), while in the UK, Ofcom used the CTIA test to check 10 off-the-shelf phones in 2016 (PDF).\nOfcom withheld the names of the phones it tested because there weren\u2019t enough samples to show statistically significant differences \u2013 it tested three of each device \u2013 and because \u201cno handset outperformed the others across different frequency bands and technologies\u201d. Knowing the names would therefore not help consumers.\nHowever, Ofcom did point out that the non-smartphones outperformed the smartphones, and that \u201csome of the smartphones tested required over 10x (10dB) more power than the best performing non-smartphone\u201d.\nYou could always buy a cheap Nokia for making voice calls.\nLast year, Ireland\u2019s ComReg (Commission for Communications Regulation) tested 71 mobile phones that were available on the Irish market in June 2017. The aim was to \u201cquantify the minimum signal level(s) required to make or receive a mobile call and to stream data\u201d (PDF).\nComReg names names and gives results, but only for TRP (active transmission) not TIS (reception). It doesn\u2019t explain why. The CTIA test recommends that TRP and TIS are tested concurrently, because a phone\u2019s internal components (processor, memory and so on) generate electrical noise that affects reception.\nStellaDoradus has published a table of the results, which includes some strikingly low numbers for some popular phones. I wouldn\u2019t use it as the sole basis for a purchasing decision.\nMost tests assume that all models of a particular phone will perform in the same way, but Ofcom found differences. As with other products, phones that look identical can vary. In some cases, they may have been assembled in different countries, and use slightly different components. In others, the circuitry may have been revised between editions. Even if the internal components seem to be the same, there could be some sample variation, without a phone actually being faulty.\nThis makes me wonder if your Moto 3 is below average in reception performance. In most cases, no one would ever know, but you are literally an \u201cedge case\u201d. With a new phone, it might be worth asking the supplier for a different sample, but it may be too late for that.\nIt would be interesting to know what would happen if you swapped phones and sims with your wife. You may have a bigger capacitance than your wife, electronically speaking, and possibly much bigger hands. Both can and do affect reception. If your Moto 3 works better in her hands, then either you or your sim are degrading the performance. It might be worth getting a new sim.\nAs you already know, using your phone on a selfie stick can improve performance. You may also get better reception by not touching the phone and using the built-in speakerphone.\nYou could also try using a signal booster or repeater. These used to be illegal, but on 12 April last year, Ofcom approved the use of some models in homes and road vehicles \u201cbut not in boats or static caravans\u201d. However, check carefully because illegal signal boosters are still available.\nOtherwise, your best bet might be an EE Signal Box \u2013 which converts any broadband service into a local 3G mobile phone network \u2013 if you can get one. EE doesn\u2019t list them for sale on its consumer website, though you might still be able to persuade a customer service agent to sell or even give you one.\nEE does promote the Signal Box to business users, and you can buy them second hand on eBay.\nAlternatively, switch to Vodafone. Not only does this provide a better signal in your area, it will happily sell you its own femtocell, the Vodafone Sure Signal V3, for a very reasonable \u00a369. You could certainly discuss this with EE\u2019s business retention team.\nHave you got a question? Email it to Ask.Jack@theguardian.com",

They lead us to believe that we can make things afresh and, at the start of a new year, that is what we need.\nI had a baby last Christmas and subsequently much of my reading over the year has been about becoming a parent. Memoirs by Rachel Cusk, Anne Enright and Rivka Galchen all have passages of insight and identification but the best was Expecting by Scottish journalist Chitra Ramaswamy, on pregnancy, her own and in literature. She\u2019s a beautiful writer and this book \u2013 which moves from an Edinburgh loo, through Sylvia Plath and Susan Sontag, to the Hebrides, to Anna Karenina, to the birthing pool and operating theatre \u2013 was my treasured companion in the early secretive days of pregnancy; it reassured me that you can make the move into motherhood without losing your intellect. I\u2019ll be giving copies to expectant friends.\nThe other excellent parenting title I read was psychologist Charles Fernyhough\u2019s The Baby in the Mirror, in which he closely observes the first three years of his daughter\u2019s life and combines this with what is known scientifically about child development. I particularly enjoyed a deconstruction of a game of I-spy, characteristically forensic as well as affectionate.\nI only came to the Patrick Melrose novels, the first of which were published in the 1990s, after watching the excellent 2018 TV adaptation, but Never Mind by Edward St Aubyn is brilliant: he has such a singular voice \u2013 terrifying and piercingly funny. I\u2019m fascinated with the shadows that childhood can cast, explored in this case through the abuse of Melrose, a cipher for St Aubyn. It shows how the building blocks of a personality are laid and has an unbeatable ear for the particular wrong-headed attitudes and monstrous characters of its upper-class setting \u2013 laced with a complicated affection for them.\nAnother novel, more recently published, is All Among the Barley by Melissa Harrison, set in 1933 in a rural East Anglian community, looking at what led to the beginning of the second world war. \u201cFarming, folklore and fascism\u201d is how the author herself flippantly describes it. It is precise and moving on agricultural practices and tradition, and the natural world, including a subplot about the endangered corncrake. Protagonist Edie is at the beginning of adulthood and negotiating her choices, with temptation from the glamorous Constance FitzAllen, a dangerously alluring character.\nIn 2019 I will celebrate eight years sober. In The Recovering: Intoxication and its Aftermath, Leslie Jamison, one of the most accomplished and challenging essayists around, explores the topic at (quite some) length. It is not your average recovery memoir \u2013 it takes a step back and examines dominating narratives of addiction and recovery and the myth of the tortured artist. Anyone considering using the new year as a prompt to change their drinking habits will find much to consider here. Jamison fights, as I have, to write about what comes after getting sober \u2013 not the drunken backstory but the reality of a positive new start: \u201cI\u2019d always been enthralled by stories of wreckage. But I wanted to know if stories about getting better could ever be as compelling as stories about falling apart. I needed to believe they could.\u201d\n Amy Liptrot\u2019s The Outrun is published by Canongate.",

        "content": "The stage will see a host of star names over the next 12 months as well as yet more movie musicals and a much-anticipated drama about the Clintons\nIf Broadway strides into 2019 without last year\u2019s parade of two-parters and kiddie juggernauts, the cavalcade includes a familiar assortment of celebrity-driven revivals, musicals adapted from popular movies and jukebox properties. And yet, there are a few genuinely unusual entries, which ought to pep up an otherwise conventional season.\nThough Broadway has become a fraught place for new plays, there are four new or new-ish ones this spring, two of them produced by the not-for-profit Manhattan Theatre Club, the other two courtesy of the for-profit producer Scott Rudin. Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s gentle, gospel-infused Choir Boy, which played off-Broadway in 2013 to mostly strong reviews, is finally transferring, a decision probably owing to the success of Moonlight, the best picture winner co-written by McCraney. A play even more likely to make headlines is James Graham\u2019s Ink, based on the early life of Rupert Murdoch. Rupert Goold, who premiered the play in 2017 at the Almeida, will again direct with Bertie Carvel as Murdoch (a male Trunchbull?) and Jonny Lee Miller as the editor Larry Lamb.\nThey will be joined by Lucas Hnath\u2019s Hillary and Clinton (yes, that Hillary and that Clinton, mostly). Set in 2008 and starring John Lithgow and the ferocious Laurie Metcalf (she also starred in Hnath\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House Part 2), it finds the couple on the eve of the New Hampshire primaries. Hnath\u2019s play can be read as a prequel of our present political moment, while Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus, looks to be a follow-up to Shakespeare\u2019s Worst Roman Bake-off. It\u2019s by Taylor Mac (A 24-Decade History of Popular Music), one of the most joyful and subversive artists working today. Little is known about Gary, but it stars a trio of comedic geniuses \u2013 Nathan Lane, Andrea Martin and Kristine Nielsen \u2013 and will apparently center on a couple of lowly servants charged with mopping up the blood and offal.\nFor years Broadway has had a woman problem. While two-thirds of Broadway attendees are women, female writers, directors and composers are very much a minority. And this year, like last fall, women\u2019s stories are also somewhat rare, though there are plenty of couples narratives. In place of actual stories about women, producers have decided to gender-swap two very masculine plays, David Mamet\u2019s testosterone-driven Glengarry Glen Ross, will feature an all-female cast, under Amy Morton\u2019s direction. Following her triumph in Three Tall Women, Glenda Jackson will play another towering character, taking on the titular role in Shakespeare\u2019s bad dad tragedy King Lear. She first played the role in 2016 at the Old Vic, but this is a new production, led by Sam Gold, a director who has rarely met a classic he couldn\u2019t deconstruct.\nOther revivals include All My Sons, which recently swapped out directors after the Arthur Miller estate refused to approve its non-traditional casting, True West, starring Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano as rivalrous siblings and Burn This, with Keri Russell and Adam Driver as combustible lovers.\nAs for musical revivals, there is an apparently traditional revival of Cole Porter\u2019s Kiss Me, Kate (It may brush up its Shakespeare, but will it brush up its spanking scene?) and a bracingly non-traditional Oklahoma!, directed by Daniel Fish, which refits the score for a lush bluegrass ensemble and re-examines the original\u2019s treatment of sex, violence and communal culpability.\nThe 1982 Sydney Pollack film Tootsie has been converted to musical comedy, starring the wonderful Santino Fontana as an actor who mans up by wearing a dress and pantyhose. The songs are by David Yazbek of The Band\u2019s Visit. Another movie title on the lips of theater fans (just don\u2019t say it three times) is Beetlejuice. Directed by Alex Timbers, it\u2019s been adapted by Scott Brown and Anthony King, who wrote the very funny off-Broadway show Gutenberg! The Musical, with songs by Eddie Perfect, who contributed to the terrifying-in-all-the-wrong-ways King Kong. Timbers will also direct Moulin Rouge! The Musical, the ahistorical tale of a flaneur, a courtesan and quite a lot of marmalade. And receiving the jukebox treatment are the Temptations with Ain\u2019t Too Proud \u2013 The Life and Times of The Temptations. Directed by Jersey Boys\u2019 (and more regrettably Summer\u2019s) Des McAnuff, it has a book by Dominique Morisseau, who goes behind and alongside the musical.\nThat leaves two original musicals. Joe Iconis\u2019s Be More Chill is a rock and power-pop show about a high school zero who becomes a zeroes-and-ones hero after he swallows a supercomputer. The show had a tepid initial run a few years ago, but teenagers discovered the songs online and built a hugely dedicated and proudly unchill fan base. The other show, Ana\u00efs Mitchell\u2019s Hadestown, directed by Rachel Chavkin of Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812, has had an even longer road to Broadway. (Some of that road is literal: it started a dozen years ago as a song cycle that toured around Vermont by bus.) A folk opera riff on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, it\u2019s about an artist who tries to change the world \u2013 or maybe just Broadway \u2013 with a song.",

        "content": "Claire Adam\u2019s debut novel is set hours from Trinidad\u2019s capital in a part of the island that one character describes as \u201conly bush-and-bandits\u201d. In a modest home, with cracking walls, Clyde Deyalsingh is trying to build a future for his family. He has twins, Peter and Paul, who share a bed, under which their books are kept. Clyde\u2019s wife asks him to buy shelves, but he is saving for a bigger dream. He has bet all his efforts on Peter\u2019s prospects.\nGenetically, the twins are identical, but in character and comportment, they are as different as can be. Peter is the golden son. He walks tall and proud. From a young age, he is acknowledged by everyone to be special. In exam after exam, he scores top marks. His father hopes he will win the Golden Medal that will award him the prize money to study in America.\nAccording to family lore, Paul is \u201cslightly retarded\u201d due to a problem at birth. At 13, he wears his hair so long and wild that everyone in the neighbourhood calls him Tarzan. He is a daydreamy kid, who finds that when he tries to read, the letters \u201clook like ants crawling around on the page\u201d. Paul dreams of leaving school, getting a job, and using the money to buy baggy jeans and Ray-Ban sunglasses. The rest he would give to his mother in \u201ca big wad of cash\u201d. Then one night, Paul disappears. Clyde skips work to search the island for his ungolden child.\nWhen I realised Adam\u2019s novel was about a missing twin, I expected mistaken identities or impersonations: essentially gimmicks. What I got was an examination of parenthood. As I read Golden Child, an old expression flickered on the edge of my consciousness \u2013 rob Peter to pay Paul. We all know that feeling of being stretched between obligations, the dread that we will fail someone dear. For many that\u2019s just parenthood. If there\u2019s enough money, there isn\u2019t enough time. If there\u2019s enough time, there isn\u2019t enough patience. Children wonder: why do I have to inherit her hand-me-downs? Why is he always forgiven, when I am punished? Is he better looking? Is she smarter? Am I loved less? Am I worthy of the love I receive? With luck and kindness, when the siblings grow up these differences can be joked about over lunch: the bitterness adds flavour like salt to good bread. But what if the stakes are higher? What if only one son can have the future the father dreams of?\nI won\u2019t give away the plot, but I will say there comes a moment when Clyde must choose between his two sons. His anguish is delicately rendered. He worries for the safety not only of his children but of his wife. He tries so hard to walk the straight and true path. He believes the kind of man you have for a father determines your future, and \u201cnobody can control what kind of father they get\u201d. Clyde spends all his effort on being the right kind. He is willing to sacrifice leisure, his father\u2019s home, his own pride, anything it takes for his sons. It should be enough to care for two boys. But somehow it isn\u2019t.\nAlthough Clyde is our guiding eye, the narrative stretches beyond him. We see Paul\u2019s inner life \u2013 one that is entirely hidden from Clyde. Paul has an artistic eye and appreciates \u201cthe bright, round moon\u201d and \u201cthe pinpricks of stars\u201d. We discover that much of his apparent stupidity is actually shyness. He is afraid of exams, of school, and of his father\u2019s rage. We find out that he is kind: at night, he lets his brother take more than his share of the bed. We view the family from the outside through the eyes of Father Kavanagh, a priest who is giving Paul private lessons. Father Kavanagh does not believe Paul to be \u201cretarded\u201d; to him, Clyde appears extreme in his fixation on securing a bright future for his golden son.\nThough much time is devoted to the psychology of his brother and father, the novel dips only briefly into the mind of Peter, the golden child. I wish the son after whom the book is named had been afforded a few more pages, but in those that we are given, Adam is subtle and delicate in her portrayal of the unique stresses of being the favourite child and the one on whom the future rests.\nOverall, this book manages to combine two things rarely bound together in the same spine: a sensitive depiction of family life and the page-flicking urgency of a thriller. And it will leave you wondering what you would have done in Clyde\u2019s place.\n Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s Harmless Like You is published by Sceptre. Golden Child is published by Faber.

During that period 3,892 people were injured, down from 4,005 last year. Although this year\u2019s death toll was up, the collision count was down slightly, from 3,841.\nSpeeding was the second most reported cause of collisions this year, accounting for 28%. Eighty per cent of vehicles involved in crashes were motorcycles.\nLast month the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Thailand\u2019s road collision-related death rate was 32.7 people out of every 100,000, the highest in south-east Asia. The organisation has blamed Thai authorities for not implementing road safety rules effectively, leading to many drivers taking to the roads when drunk or without holding driving licences.\nAfter last year\u2019s record death toll was reported, Liviu Vedrasco of the WHO said that although the Seven Dangerous Days received much attention, poor road safety was a year-round problem in Thailand. \u201cRoads in Thailand are dangerous every day, not only seven,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the WHO, Libya is the only country with a higher road collision death rate. In 2015 the organisation reported a figure of 73.4 deaths out of every 100,000 people in the African country.",

The campaign states that the army could use the \u201ccompassion\u201d of \u201csnowflakes\u201d, the \u201cself-belief\u201d of millennials, the \u201cconfidence\u201d of selfie takers, and the \u201cfocus\u201d of phone zombies.\nThe army designed the campaign to show that it looks beyond stereotypes and \u201csees people differently\u201d, and recognises their \u201cneed for a bigger sense of purpose\u201d, according to Maj Gen Paul Nanson.\nThe campaign is targeting 16- to 25-year-olds, part of what is sometimes known as Generation Z. It will include a series of TV and radio adverts, as well as a billboard campaign.\nThe army based the campaign on the historic Your Country Needs You first world war poster featuring Field Marshal Lord Kitchener.\nThe TV ads build on the idea that young ambitious people may feel undervalued and want a job with greater purpose. These would-be recruits are first shown at home or at work, with others calling out their stereotypes, before the scene suddenly changes and shows them in army roles, ranging from soldiers assisting on humanitarian missions in war-torn villages to providing support in a hurricane relief effort.\nThe ad also shows a gamer up all night, which the army sees as showing stamina and dedication. In another scene, someone is shown slowly stowing supermarket shopping trolleys, to the annoyance of their workmates, but the army could instead read this as them being a slow and steady perfectionist with patience.\nNanson said: \u201cThe army sees people differently and we are proud to look beyond the stereotypes and spot the potential in young people, from compassion to self-belief.\u201d\nThe defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, described the campaign as \u201ca powerful call to action that appeals to those seeking to make a difference as part of an innovative and inclusive team\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cIt shows that time spent in the army equips people with skills for life and provides comradeship, adventure and opportunity like no other job does. Now all jobs in the army are open to men and women. The best just got better.\u201d\nThe army has previously been accused of bowing to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d after it launched a campaign to recruit more people from a diversity of genders, sexualities, ethnicities and faiths.\nIn June 2018, the Guardian revealed that the army targeted recruitment material at \u201cstressed and vulnerable\u201d 16-year-olds via social media on and around GCSE results day. The campaign suggested a career in the army would still be open to the teenagers if they did not get the grades they hoped for, with critics accusing the army of cynically trying to recruit young people at a time when they were worried about their future prospects.\nThe recruitment campaign comes as the army failed to meet recruitment targets as it \u201cunderestimated the complexity of what it was trying to achieve\u201d when it embarked on a project with outsourcing giant Capita, according to a National Audit Office report in December.\nCapita was awarded the \u00a3495m contract for army recruitment in 2012 but the army has not recruited the number of soldiers it requires in any year since the contract began.\nThe Commons defence committee was told in October that the army had 77,000 fully trained troops compared with a target of 82,500.\nForty-seven per cent of applicants dropped out of the process voluntarily in 2017-18, and both the army and Capita believe the length of the process is a significant factor in this, according to the report.",

Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League and Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, has said 10 vaccines are \u201ctoo much\u201d.\nRicciardi said in an interview with Corriere della Sera: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that when the deputy prime minister says that he, as a father, believes there are too many obligatory, useless and dangerous vaccines, that\u2019s not just unscientific, it\u2019s anti-scientific.\u201d\nHe also said repeated claims that migrants brought diseases were \u201cgroundless\u201d, the government\u2019s insistence that waste-to-energy plants are obsolete was \u201cnonsensical\u201d, and a decision to ease restrictions on the use of contaminated soils in farming was taken without evaluating the impact on health.\nHe likened the government\u2019s approach to the Trump administration\u2019s reported recommendation to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop using the term \u201cevidence-based\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an approach taken by populists who have great difficulty interacting with science,\u201d he said.\nHis resignation in December came after Giulia Grillo, the M5S health minister, sacked the entire board of Italy\u2019s higher health council, which advises the government on health policy, to \u201copen the door to other deserving personalities\u201d. A new committee is expected to be selected this month.\nM5S has in the past endorsed unproven cures for cancer, and in 2013 the party was a vociferous supporter of Stamina, a stem-cell therapy promoted by a psychologist that was later proven to be a con.\nGrillo has caused confusion by making several U-turns on the child vaccine policy. She first said that parents could \u201cself-certify\u201d that their children had been vaccinated, instead of providing a doctor\u2019s note, causing mayhem at the start of the school year. Then in mid-November, amid a measles epidemic, the government said it would uphold the vaccines obligation and called for 800,000 infants, children and young adults to be vaccinated. The decision was made on the advice of the health committee.",

The mission was deemed a failure after computer problems meant it was unable to collect any scientific data\n1965: Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov performs the first spacewalk, leaving the Voskhod 2 spacecraft for 12 minutes\n1969: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first people to set foot on the moon\n1971: Russia becomes the first country to land a spacecraft on Mars\n1974: Mariner 10 makes the first flybys of Venus and Mars\n1979: First flybys of Jupiter and Saturn conducted by American spacecraft Voyager 1 and Pioneer 11\n1997: Mars Pathfinder becomes the first roving probe to operate on another planet\u00a0\n1998: International Space Station launched\n2014: Rosetta probe makes first landing on a comet\n2019: New Horizons mission makes the most distant flyby ever, returning images of a rock known as Ultima Thule in the Kuiper belt\n2019: China\u2019s Chang\u2019e 4 makes the first successful soft landing on the far side of the moon\nThe landing was described as \u201can impressive accomplishment\u201d by Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.\nMartin Wieser, a scientist at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and principal investigator on one of the instruments onboard Chang\u2019e, said: \u201cWe know the far side from orbital images and satellites, but we don\u2019t know it from the surface. It\u2019s uncharted territory and that makes it very exciting.\u201d\nA significant challenge faced by the Chinese team was the inability to communicate directly with the spacecraft. Signals to and from the rover are being relayed through a satellite called Queqiao (Magpie Bridge). Queqiao is in a \u201chalo orbit\u201d on the other side of the moon, from where it can communicate with both Chang\u2019e and the Earth.\nDuring the final phases of the approach, however, Chang\u2019e 4 was on its own and could not be operated remotely. Starting from an altitude of 15km, the craft used a rocket booster to decelerate.\nAt 100 metres above the lunar surface, the probe briefly hovered to identify obstacles and measured the slopes on the surface. Using a a hi-tech camera and laser measurements to avoid boulders and ditches, it selected a relatively flat area and resumed a slow, vertical descent, touching down softly in the Von Karman Crater within the South Pole-Aitken Basin, according to a report by the Xinhua news agency.\nChang\u2019e 4 targeted the Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater, which was predicted to have a smooth volcanic floor and which sits within the great Aitken basin.\n\u201cThis is a great technological accomplishment as it was out of sight of Earth, so signals are relayed back by their orbiter, and most of the landing was actually done autonomously in difficult terrain,\u201d said Prof Andrew Coates, a space scientist at UCL\u2019s Mullard Space Science Laboratory. \u201cThe landing was almost vertical because of the surrounding hills.\u201d\nAfter landing, the solar panels and antennas on the probe were unfolded under the control of the space engineers in Beijing. Mission control in Beijing are now preparing to send signals for the rover to separate from the lander.\nSpacecraft have taken pictures of the moon\u2019s far side before, but no lander has ever touched down there.\nInstruments onboard the Chang\u2019e lander and rover will aim to study the local lunar geology, probe the moon\u2019s interior, and analyse the solar wind \u2013 a stream of high-energy particles that flow from the sun. Onboard experiments will also test how well plants grow in the weak lunar gravity.\nThe far side of the moon is of particular scientific interest as it is heavily pockmarked by deep craters \u2013 more so than the nearside, where a succession of lava flows have obscured many of the earliest impacts. Scientists are still trying to understand why there are differences between the two faces of the moon, but think that these probably date back to the moon\u2019s origin.\nThe Aitken basin, where Chang\u2019e 4 has landed, is the Moon\u2019s largest and oldest impact crater. Dating when the basin was created could help narrow down the window for a period of heavy bombardment of the moon and inner planets by asteroids left over from the formation of the solar system. Intriguingly, the timing of the heavy bombardment closely coincides with when life appeared on Earth and scientists are trying to work out the exact sequence and whether the bombardment by asteroids might have created the conditions for life.\n\u201cUnderstanding the intensity and timing of the bombardment is important as \u2026 that was going on about the same time that life appeared on Earth,\u201d said Ian Crawford, professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck University, London. \u201cThe Earth has lost its record of that very early time.\u201d\nDuring the coming weeks mission control are expected to spend time testing that the rover is operating as expected, before starting to collect data and beam it back to Earth. Weiser said he expected to get the first batch of data back in mid-February.\nIn the next phase of China\u2019s lunar programme, the Chang\u2019e 5 and 6 missions will attempt to collect lunar samples and return them to Earth. Chang\u2019e 5 is due to launch in December next year.\n This article was amended on 4 January 2019 to correct the spelling of Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, from Brindestine as an earlier version said.",

        "content": "The German legend in F1 \u2013 and chariot \u2013 action, plus: shock cup exits, tumbling, sneaky drinks and dazzling darts\n1) Today, Michael Schumacher turns 50. He won a grand prix for the first time at Spa in 1992 for Benetton. He\u2019d go on to win five more in Belgium, and another 85 elsewhere. He didn\u2019t win at Spa in 1998 though, and was ultra-keen on telling telling David Coulthard all about it after colliding with the Scot. (They made up in later years.) His ludicrously storied career could keep you occupied for days. To start you down the rabbit-hole, here\u2019s a look at his cars that took the chequered flag at Spa. Schumacher v Senna in the Brazilian\u2019s backyard in 1992. Tears post-race at Monza in 2000 after equalling Senna\u2019s tally of 41 race wins. He didn\u2019t win the Australian Grand Prix in 1994, but his collision with Damon Hill in Adelaide decided the championship in his favour. A fabulous ding-dong with Jean Alesi at the N\u00fcrburgring in 1995. Stunning overtaking to squeak by Mika Hakkinen at Monza in 1998. Fast hands in the cockpit on his pole lap in Malaysia in 1999. Keeping Fernando Alonso at bay at Imola in 2006. He retired following a dominant decade with Ferrari that season, but after being tempted back first by the makers of Asterix at the Olympics Games for a chariot-racing cameo, and then by Mercedes, he waved goodbye again three seasons later with a farewell lap at Interlagos.\n2) Ladies tumbling! Men tumbling! Ascoli goalkeeper Filippo Perucchini: stumbling! Fielders fumbling, too, before one of the weirdest run outs of the festive season which saw Alex Carey dismissed after two failed attempts to fell the stumps at the other end. Elsewhere, in the Big Bash, there was a big bash to the helmet for Jason Sangha after a mean delivery from Jhye Richardson. Jos Buttler, meanwhile, is having loads of fun.\n3) \u201cCan I check your bag, madam? Just binoculars, carry on.\u201d\n10 out of 10 for effort on this! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/LUq485Ia6Y\n4) It\u2019s been a great couple of weeks of darts, capped by Michael van Gerwen sealing his third PDC world title against Michael Smith. Here\u2019s the Dutchman with back-to-back nine-darters in 2013, and attempting the round-the-clock challenge \u2013 trying to hit every double, in order, with the fewest darts.\n5) FA Cup third round klaxon! So time to revisit Ronnie Radford doing pretty things in the mud in 1972, Sutton United, Matthew Hanlan and all that v Coventry in 1989. Mickey Thomas\u2019s rocket-boosted effort for Wrexham to see off Arsenal in 1992. More recently: freshly-in-the-league Stevenage 3-1 Newcastle in 2011. Eden Hazard got up from a Phil Jones special to win it from the spot for Chelsea last year, and meanwhile here are some of the best strikes from the second round this season.\n6) When Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie played his final game for Clermont Auvergne after 19 years with the club, it all got a touch emotional. The 38-year-old made over 400 appearances for the French club and also earned 76 international caps for France, with colleagues and rivals paying their full respects.\n1) How to save yourself from a tricky situation with just a golf club for company.\n2) Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan at his best, redubbed with choice excerpts of John Virgo overexcitement.\n3) Fascinating al-Jazeera doc on west African footballers finding their way in Thailand.\nSpotters\u2019 badges: Whobroughtoranges, LongBallToNoOne, Tony06\nDo subscribe if you fancy.\nDo subscribe if you fancy.",

        "content": "Taking part in Veganuary or just trying to cut down on meat and dairy this year? Here are the best wraps, salads, sushi and more\nFrom Spam Appreciation Week in March to June\u2019s National Fudge Day and Sourdough September, every day of the year seems to have an (often baffling) link to a foodstuff. On the Guardian food desk, we take this with a pinch of salt \u2013 and not just on National Salt Awareness Week (from 29 February) \u2013 lest your year in recipes and food articles becomes subsumed by commercial partnerships.\nBut Veganuary, the movement encouraging us to try cutting out animal protein and produce for the first month of the year (in the hope that we\u2019ll keep it up), feels a bit less silly. If adopted by enough people, veganism presents a viable way to offset environmental damage. It hit the mainstream in 2018, with conscious cooks and eaters embracing meat, fish, dairy and egg alternatives \u2013 from jackfruit to pulses \u2013 in their thousands. The Vegan Society says the UK\u2019s vegan contingent has grown fourfold in just four years, from 150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000 now, while last year Waitrose became the first supermarket to have a dedicated vegan section in 134 of its stores.\nGoing vegan does, however, demand a level of organisation and planning \u2013 and Veganuary is no exception. Where can you buy cashew cheese? What are the non-vegan ingredients everyone forgets about? Who writes the best (and easiest) vegan recipes? And, if you aren\u2019t cooking and need a speedy feed al desko, where can you find the best vegan lunch to go? To answer that last question, I ate a dozen lunches from outlets near the office, and here\u2019s what I found \u2026\nIt may be hard to balls up a hummus wrap, but I do think this one is pretty good for the price \u2013 it hits the spot, ranking low on imagination, but higher on palatability. The vegan chilli is very good \u2013 in spite of my objection to the side-soup format (taking more than half the price of the full-size option from customers for what seems like less than half the volume), and despite my hankering for an unvegan dollop of sour cream on top of it.4/5\nSushi has an unfair advantage over other lunch options: douse with enough soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and it always tastes good. This is as true of the vegan stuff as it is of fish, so I enjoyed this spread of rice, seaweed, vegetable and tofu concoctions, in spite of the whole premise of \u201ctakeaway sushi\u201d somehow seeming wrong (given it is traditionally defined by the care, attention and precision with which it is made).4/5\nA paltry boxful of autumn and winter hues, this is tasty, but not one for the hungry. It has four components, of which the kale and lentil salad is the high point. The curried squash is nice, the hummus fine (you can\u2019t go wrong), but there are two dried-up falafel-brown orbs of vegetal dust. I\u2019m generally very keen on Leon\u2019s vegan offering, but this isn\u2019t their strongest option.3/5\nSoft tacos need to be heated to stop them falling apart. These had a split second on the grill before being loaded with a dead weight of loveless roasted veg and guacamole, and seasoned with bitter disappointment (but no salt). At \u00a36.30, this is at the dearer end of the spectrum, and that\u2019s not including the (vegan) cereal bar I had to buy afterwards to cheer myself up.1/5\nA generous box of orzo in tomato sauce, peppered with tired roasted veg and some arbitrary spinach leaves. This comes with an abundance of very sweet dressing which imparts flavour to something that would otherwise be bland \u2013 but it\u2019s far too sugary. I sense the boxed pasta salad might have had its time; there\u2019s something outdated about this \u2013 which perhaps says all you need to know about Eat, really.1/5\nSo good. Leon manages to make its vegan boxes delicious and desirable in their own right \u2013 quite a feat. These beans, seasoned with hot smoked sweet paprika (the spice used in chorizo) have a \u201cmeatiness\u201d and are served over brown rice for a result that is wholesome, filling and satisfying. For the price, you won\u2019t find a better vegan feed.5/5\nA better Mexican than Benito\u2019s Hat, ticking the vital boxes that lunch should tick: tasty, sustaining and affordable. The wheat tortilla is made of pumpkin, which, though doughy, has a little more chutzpah on the taste front than wheat wraps usually do. Filled with black bean paste, cumin roasted butternut squash, chipotle salsa, spinach and coriander, it tastes freshly made and has plenty of flavour. Might be interesting to try the filling with a corn tortilla, though, for something gluten-free as well as vegan.4/5\nHas the visual appeal of a molehill, but is better in the mouth. The red lentil hummus needs seasoning, but I like the fact that this is filling and has lots of different textures, colours and flavours to keep me interested. I\u2019m disappointed by the packaging, which I\u2019d expect to feel a little more sustainable.3/5\nI had to have some jackfruit at some point \u2013 it was the darling ingredient for vegans in 2018, and is said to be a plant-based answer to pulled pork. I thought this was delicious, but it needed the addition of zingy guacamole and crunchy coleslaw at the till \u2013 to accompany the sweetness of sweet potato mash and the spicy jackfruit curry. The ingredients are, however, largely cheap, so I would say this is \u00a31 too expensive.4/5\nI like the M&S two-for-\u00a34 deal \u2013 a bargain. I\u2019m less impressed by the packaging \u2013 which not only sounds my eco alarm bells, but makes the food look so much less appealing. The Thai flavours in the salad (ginger and soy) are quite simply delicious, while the \u201cmeh\u201d Mexican rice (I have decided all Mexican lunches need to come with extra lime for some zing) at least offers up the bulk I need. I was surprised not more of M&S\u2019s options were vegan; they could do with a couple more.4/5\nI\u2019m a big fan of Gail\u2019s and this feels fresh, hearty and good for me, with lashings of roasted cabbage and pecan pesto dressing. I think it\u2019s a bit underseasoned and could do with a more generous dollop of the pesto, on which it relies for its character. Were it not a vegan number, they would probably have thrown some crumbled feta over, but given the plant-based straitjacket, they need to make up for the flavour deficit.4/5\nWe eat with our eyes as well as our palates, and I find it difficult to see past this bowlful\u2019s lack of visual appeal, with its limp assembly of veg and herbs \u2013 another example of plastic packaging really not helping the dish out. But it\u2019s worth doffing our caps to Tesco for having a relatively extensive line of affordable vegan lunch options, created for them by Wicked Kitchen. My rainbow curry bowl is full of flavour, with curried lentils and chickpeas, (slightly soggy) onion bhajis, mango cubes and minty dressing \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say the simply roasted sweet potato is \u201ctandoori style\u201d.2/5",

        "content": "More than 10m visited Paris museum, with interest boosted by music video filmed there\nThe Louvre, the world\u2019s most visited museum, broke all ticket office records last year with more than 10 million people viewing its Paris collection of fine arts and antiquities, boosted by foreign tourists and the interest in Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s music video filmed there.\nThe 10.2 million people who came to the museum in 2018 marked a 25% rise in visitors, beating the previous record of 9.7 million visitors in 2012. It is the highest number for a museum of its kind, ahead of the National Museum of China and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\nThe rise was due in part to international tourists returning to Paris after large numbers stayed away in the years after the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. Foreigners made up almost three-quarters of visitors to the Louvre; the biggest number of foreign visitors were from the US, followed by China. But 2.5 million French people also visited, including increasing numbers of schoolchildren, as outings to tourist sites had been limited after the terrorist attacks that struck the country in recent years.\nThe Louvre has managed to maintain its high numbers of young visitors \u2013 more than 50% are under 30 \u2013 and was helped by the success of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s video for Apeshit last summer, which was shot in the museum and featured key works, including the Mona Lisa and Jacques-Louis David\u2019s masterpiece, The Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon and the Coronation of Empress Jos\u00e9phine.\nThe video, viewed more than 150m times online, was seen as an important comment on the representation of power in art, and on race and colonialism, as well as being a conversation starter for young visitors. It led the museum to create a special visitor guide based on the video, which was a success and gave the permanent collection what one museum worker called the feeling of a \u201ccool brand\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that 2018 was a remarkable year for the international reputation of the Louvre,\u201d the museum\u2019s director, Jean-Luc Martinez, told French radio. \u201cThe Beyonc\u00e9 video, like the opening of the Louvre museum in Abu Dhabi, ensured that the Louvre was talked about across the world, and one of the consequences of that is the spectacular rise in visitor numbers last year.\u201d\nThis year the museum is hoping to bring in more young visitors by adding free night-time visits on the first Saturday of the month.\nThe museum\u2019s success in 2018 was also helped by major exhibitions, in particular a spectacular retrospective of the 19th century artist Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. This year\u2019s unprecedented Leonardo da Vinci exhibition \u2013 part of a Europe-wide commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the Renaissance master\u2019s death \u2013 is expected to attract large numbers.\nThe museum also said the rise in visitors had been helped by the vast refurbishment of the entry and ticket office, funded in part through agreement with the Abu Dhabi branch, as well as online ticket sales that had reduced waiting times.\nThe museum said the gilets jaunes anti-government demonstrations in central Paris in late November and December had not affected visitor numbers. The protests had caused the museum to close on one Saturday only, it said.",

        "content": "Many traditional parties are trying to co-opt the agenda of the radical right in order to defeat them. But various elections in 2018 reveal the limits of that approach\nAfter the Dutch parliamentary elections of March 2017, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, triumphantly declared that \u201cgood populism\u201d had defeated \u201cbad populism\u201d, a claim eagerly and uncritically repeated in media around the world. It confirmed received wisdom that the best way to defeat the populist radical right, is to co-opt a moderate version of their agenda, while excluding the party itself.\nFew cared that Rutte\u2019s claim rested on dubious empirical grounds: compared with the 2012 election, Rutte actually lost big (-5.2%), whereas Geert Wilder\u2019s Party for Freedom (PVV) made gains (+3.0%) and was joined by a new far-right party, Forum for Democracy (FvD), with 1.8%, making their combined scored of 14.9%. That\u2019s less than one percentage point lower than the PVV\u2019s high score of 15.45% in 2010.\nThree 2018 elections will provide more ammunition for the debate on how best to respond to the radical right. In Sweden, the rise of the Sweden Democrats was not halted in the parliamentary election in September, despite a significant turn to the right by the center-right Moderates and even the center-left Social Democrats. Both the Moderates (which lost 3.5% of their vote share) and the Social Democrats (which lost 2.8%) lost, while the Sweden Democrats were the biggest winners, coming in third with 17.5%, an increase of 4.7%.\nThe results were fairly similar in the much-anticipated state elections in Bavaria, where the hegemonic Christian Social Union (CSU) had practically copied the agenda of the populist radical right Alternative for Germany (AfD), just as they had done with the Republicans in the early 1990s. In fact, the CSU\u2019s regional struggle with the AfD had crippled the already troubled Grand Coalition in Berlin, with leading CSU politicians regularly defying \u201ctheir\u201d chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin and Brussels.\nAs polls had been indicating for months, it stopped neither the ascendance of the AfD, nor the downfall of the CSU. After decades of ruling the state as a party fiefdom, the CSU lost its parliamentary majority and 10.5% of its vote share \u2013 a loss of 22% of its 2013 electorate. The AfD entered the Bavarian parliament in its first election, with 10.2% of the vote, not only less than polls had been predicting for months, but also some 2% less than the party had received in Bavaria in the 2017 federal elections.\nFinally, in the much less covered local elections in Belgium, the \u201cdemocratic nationalist\u201d New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) lost big, despite having veered staunchly right, and making opposition to immigration, and its tough (and popular) secretary of state for asylum, migration and administrative simplification, Theo Francken, the focus of its campaign.\nAt the same time, the populist radical right Flemish Interest (VB) returned from the dead, after focusing its campaign on opposition to the \u201csoft\u201d Francken, gaining its best score in decades. While extrapolations of local elections to national elections should always be treated with extreme care, the local elections indicate a possible big loss for N-VA and win for VB in next year\u2019s mass election year \u2013 Belgium will hold regional, national and European elections on 26 May 2019. And the recent withdrawal from the federal government of the N-VA, over the contentious but non-binding Marrakesh agreement will do little to mitigate that.\nSo what, if anything, can we learn from these three important elections in 2018? First, the populist radical right is still on the rise in western Europe. Second, mainstream parties that co-opt the populist radical right agenda, even if they exclude the party, still lose elections. Third, the focus on socio-cultural issues \u2013 such as immigration and, to a lesser extent, European integration \u2013 helps not just the populist radical right, but also the Greens, who were the second biggest winners in both Bavaria and Flanders.\nDoes this mean that voters prefer the original over the copy, as Jean-Marie Le Pen already declared in the 1990s? Not necessarily so. Both AfD and SD fell well below the numbers they polled several months ago, let alone in late 2016, when the EU-Turkey deal had taken the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d off the top of the political agenda. Some defenders of the co-option strategy therefore claim that they would have done much better if the mainstream right (and sometimes left) had not moved staunchly right.\nUnfortunately, this is hard to disprove. The \u201cimmigration realistic\u201d Turkey deal has clearly lowered the salience of the immigration issue, which generally leads to lower support for populist radical right parties, whose main issue is immigration. Following the same logic, focusing election campaigns of the issues of the populist radical right, and using their frames (immigration as threat), will heighten their importance and therefore strength. Even if a more anti-immigrant position will keep some voters from abandoning the center-right for the radical right, many voters are not just nativist but also populist, distrusting the mainstream parties, and therefore not open to leaving the radical right for the mainstream right.\nIn the end, of course, the question is, or should be, a moral one. Copying the issues and frames of the populist radical right leads to populist radical right discourses and policies, whether adopted by populist radical right parties or mainstream parties. This is also the lesson of the Netherlands, where the exclusion of the PVV has not prevented the mainstream right from even further toughening immigration and integration policies.\nAssuming that we (still) consider both the messenger and the message as a threat to liberal democracy, \u201cgood populism\u201d is both empirically and normatively the wrong strategy to fight \u201cbad populism\u201d.\nA version of this essay originally ran in the November/December edition of Hope not Hate\nCas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction and The Far Right in America",

        "content": "Fifa funds for women\u2019s football are alleged not to be reaching their target, with fear of extremists said to be the reason\nThe head of women\u2019s football in Somalia has urged Fifa to take action after claiming money made available by the world governing body to support the women\u2019s game in her country is not reaching its intended target.\nShaima Mohamed, who has been almost single-handedly pushing the cause of women\u2019s football in one of the world\u2019s most volatile nations, told the Guardian: \u201cI have no idea where the money goes.\u201d\nEvery national federation is entitled to money from Fifa, with $100,000 of the $500,000 available for operational costs ringfenced for women\u2019s football, while additional money is available for travel to women\u2019s tournaments and for special projects related to women\u2019s football. The Somali federation has not responded to requests for comment.\nMohamed believes federation members are unwilling to back the women\u2019s game because they fear extremists who oppose it. \u201c[They] would have sat down and talked about it and I think they are scared for their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are also responsible to help Fifa\u2019s vision for women\u2019s football.\u201d\nThe women\u2019s football department at the Somali FA is in effect inactive. Mohamed said the federation gave her an official title but turned down her request for an office, equipment and a rent-free field for training. Girls and women continue to play, notably at the Golden Club academy in Mogadishu, which Mohamed founded and runs.\n\u201cWe do fundraising to support the teams,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do social media campaigns. We get contributions from the community but we don\u2019t have a specific budget that comes to us every year. I have no idea where the money goes. I have no idea if the federation has sent details of my role and information to Fifa. We need formal recognition for Somalia women\u2019s football.\u201d\nShe called on Fifa to step in. \u201cThey should do more to ensure we are receiving our funding,\u201d she said. \u201cFifa needs to do more accountability with every federation in Africa to see if the women\u2019s funding is being spent on women\u2019s football or something else.\n\u201cFifa could also do more by improving direct communications with the women\u2019s football department. I understand the federation can\u2019t do much for women\u2019s department since they are scared for their lives but they can give us a little support until we can stand on our feet because we are willing to take the risk and we are ready to fight for what we want.\u201d\nA Fifa source told the Guardian that it had been made aware of the issues and would be making efforts to meet Mohamed to discuss the situation.\n\u201cA small amount of the SFFs Forward funds have been used in the 2016-18 cycle for women\u2019s football and women\u2019s refereeing in the region,\u201d Fifa said. \u201cBut we expect a greater commitment to be made in the new year with a dedicated Forward project for women\u2019s football. We also understand that the SFF will appoint a new team to advance women\u2019s football in Somalia. To that end the FIFA Regional Development Office in Addis Ababa will meet with the SFF soon to discuss the SFF\u2019s plans.\u201d\nIt said its commitment globally to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 football was demonstrated by a 20% increase in its Forward development fund for 2019-2022 to $6m, which includes \u201ca total investment of at least $150,000 per year per member association dedicated exclusively to women\u2019s football development\u201d, in addition to funding available through infrastructure and travel budgets.\nMohamed\u2019s frustrations were encapsulated after Golden Club were invited to send a team to the Human Rights Cup in South Africa last month to represent Somalia. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make it because we lacked financial support from both the federation, where the women\u2019s department is not active, and the government. We trained for months to prepare for the cup. We were so disappointed. Discrimination holds us back.\u201d\nMohamed, who grew up in Kenya, has been battling to establish women\u2019s football in Somalia since she moved back in 2015, aged 19. \u201cThere were no women playing football so I decided to form a group I could play with,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became an organisation. I had to open up an academy so that more girls could be inspired and empowered.\u201d\nInitial approaches to the Somali FA for support had been promising. \u201cAt first the president of the federation welcomed me. He took me to the African football symposium on women\u2019s football in Morocco earlier in 2018. It was the first time a woman from Somalia had attended such a conference.\u201d\nOn her return she says things changed: \u201cI was given the official title of head of the women\u2019s department. I asked for an office, equipment, a place to work, but the president told me to focus on the academy until people get used to what I am doing.\n\u201cI approached him again and asked for a field to train the girls because there is a lack of fields or stadiums available to women. I asked him to give us time for training and he said the country is not safe enough and said we should rent another field and they will pay for it, except that didn\u2019t last. It felt like they didn\u2019t want to give us help.\u201d\nGolden Club continues to thrive despite the difficulties. \u201cThere are a lot of young girls that are so talented but it can be hard for them since they don\u2019t have the self-confidence to come out and play football because they feel scared of society. After I created the first women\u2019s football club in Somalia I learned that football can play an important role to help women and girls build their self-confidence.\u201d\nThe civil war and the presence of groups such as al-Shabaab harmed men\u2019s football too. \u201cThe extremists didn\u2019t allow men to play football. Sometimes they used to play in a tribalism way \u2013 one tribe would play another. Now youth are engaged, there are leagues and they have even started to participate in international tournaments.\u201d\nWhat keeps Mohamed going is her passion for the game and determination to do something positive for girls who contact her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t even offer the financial support in my city, let alone go to another region. The change that needs to be made is we need fields that will be secure for the girls and we need awareness.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s football is more than just sport. We use football to fight early marriage and to fight for women\u2019s rights in society. This is important for so many girls and women in Somalia. I am fighting for their future and I will never give up.\u201d\n Arsenal have signed Danish winger Katrina Veje from Montpellier.\n Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger has left Birmingham. Last year she battled back from thyroid cancer and was named in the WSL PFA team of the year.\n Celtic have announced plans to establish their women\u2019s team as the first full-time professional set up in next season\u2019s Women\u2019s Scottish Premier League.",

        "content": "The streaming giant has cautioned those mimicking Sandra Bullock\u2019s character by walking around blindfolded to try not to injure themselves\nLast week Netflix claimed that 45 million of its subscribers had streamed the Sandra Bullock thriller Bird Box in its first week of release: a record for original movie content on the platform.\nFive days later, on 2 January, they issued a public health warning in the interests of keeping as many of those subscribers alive as possible. The service was responding to a growing social media fad for the Bird Box challenge, in which people emulate characters in the film who must perform every task blindfolded, lest lurking monsters drive them to suicide.\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE,\u201d Netflix tweeted from its primary account. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this started, and we appreciate the love, but Boy and Girl\u201d \u2013 a reference to the two unnamed children of Bullock\u2019s character \u2013 \u201chave just one wish for 2019 and it is that you not end up in the hospital due to memes.\u201d\nNetflix\u2019s call for moderation (but not abstention) from the craze comes after thousands of videos posted online show people stumbling around houses, stairs and woods with scarves wrapped round their eyes.\nMeanwhile, YouTube star Morgan Adams\u2019s 24-hour Bird Box challenge earned more than two million views in five days.\nABC\u2019s breakfast show Good Morning America also engaged with the meme when one of its anchors attempted to apply makeup to his co-host while blindfolded.\nThe film, which has overcome mixed reviews to pick up considerable momentum \u2013 as well as celebrity fans such as Kim Kardashian \u2013 stars Bullock as a single mother endeavouring to save herself and her two children in a postapocalyptic America. She and her fellow survivors must wear blindfolds to prevent exposure to supernatural forces who take the form of their most potent fears and lead them to take their own lives.\nSusanne Bier\u2019s film has earned unfavourable comparisons with last year\u2019s sensory-deprivation horror A Quiet Place, as well as 2016\u2019s alien invasion thriller Arrival. In her review for the Guardian, Amy Nicholson took particular issue with the ensemble cast, including Sarah Paulson, Jacki Weaver and John Malkovich, saying it \u201cfeels as curated as a box of donuts\u201d.\nThe narrative is adapted from a novel by Josh Malerman, and some fans of this original have taken issue with Bier\u2019s considerable tweak to the book\u2019s ending.\nNetflix rarely releases data on how many subscribers have seen films or TV shows on its site. The unverified 45 million figure represents about a third of their total customer base. Previous big hitters in terms of their original content have primarily been romcoms, with To All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before cited by the streaming giant as being a particular hit in 2018 \u2013 although no figures were released.\nThe service has also remained silent on data around its more prestige original movie content, such as Oscars frontrunner Roma and the Coen brothers\u2019 The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. The same also applies to TV content, such as interactive Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch.",

        "content": "The India batsman has three hundreds in four Tests this summer \u2013 Australia are beginning to appreciate his rare talents\nRespect is often described as grudging, and it doesn\u2019t get more grudging than from Australians for Cheteshwar Pujara. Yet as this Australia v India series plays out its final stanza, the admiration from the home players and supporters is real. Here\u2019s a player who does what their own cannot: bats as long as he wants, puts distractions aside, and refuses to go away.\nAustralians tend to celebrate impulsiveness. We like to think we have a national style summed up by Adam Gilchrist pulverising hundreds, or Shane Warne twirling out bunnies. But with no talents like theirs in the national team, people suddenly don\u2019t mind a more earnest approach.\nNick Benton is a fringe state player who once got South Australia home in a Sheffield Shield chase batting at No 11 with a dislocated shoulder. A flaming moustachioed redhead whose Twitter profile photo features him cheerfully smiling from a toilet seat, Benton seems a decent midpoint for a national barometer. His online tribute was a piece of modern Australian literature: \u201cCheteshwar Pujara. 80+ skinfolds. 8 minutes 30 for a 2km time trial (on a good day). Fields like a tree. Wears 2015 ASICS spikes. Does not give a flying fuck how boring or bad he looks. At least our blokes have good rigs and the best gear.\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t speak Australian, that\u2019s admiration. Posted while Pujara posted 130 not out on the first day of the Sydney Test, it couldn\u2019t be anything but. Three hundreds in four Tests this summer have drawn out such appreciation like Magnoplasm on a stubborn splinter.\nFor a minute in the morning Mitchell Starc looked good. He whacked Mayank Agarwal on the ankle, took both edges of KL Rahul\u2019s bat, then beat Agarwal twice in a row. Josh Hazlewood got a nick from Rahul next over, then Starc carried on beating Agarwal.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best over with the new ball Mitch Starc has bowled this summer,\u201d said the former Australia opening batsman Ed Cowan on ABC radio. \u201cThe key was the length.\u201d\nSpot on: while other services lauded Starc rediscovering his early swing, the ball-tracking technology showed he was swinging it less in Sydney than in any Test in over a year, including the UAE. The threat came because 61% of his spell was full. His last innings with a similar percentage was the opening day of the most recent Ashes in Brisbane, where the air was humid, the sky overcast, and the pitch so slow that short balls were sent home chipped and neutered.\nBut in Sydney, after Agarwal looked uncomfortable against a couple of short balls, Starc and his captain Tim Paine decided to make a day of it. He sent down nine overs in the session, unbroken but for a change to the Randwick End. With a newish ball in the first session of a Test, this second spell was 81% short balls. Hazlewood joined in. Agarwal had some dicey moments but rode it out. At the other end, negotiating it serenely, was Pujara. When it was over India remained one wicket down.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure about that, I wasn\u2019t too happy with that to be honest,\u201d said an unusually frank Nathan Lyon of his bowling colleagues after play. \u201cWe missed out on using the moisture in the wicket. I thought we could have stuck there longer. But the captain and the bowlers came up with a decent plan and unfortunately it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t work. That sums up Australia\u2019s series. Blasting opponents out worked in the Ashes a year ago. Not any more. The series plan would have been to keep Kohli quiet and let that take care of the rest: India\u2019s captain has made one hundred compared to four last time he toured, but the plan hasn\u2019t worked. About the only thing that has worked has been the bowlers: hard.\nThe fifth bowler didn\u2019t help in that regard. Another plan that hasn\u2019t worked. Marnus Labuschagne came into this Test with a first-class bowling average of nearly 50 in his career and 60 this domestic season, but was billed by his coach and captain as a leg-spinning all-rounder. His first over was pulled for three boundaries. Paine immediately dragged him from the attack.\nThe player pulling those half-trackers was Pujara, who cruised past his half-century and into the 60s. Only twice in his career has he scored more than a dozen runs from an over. Then he marched off for tea.\nBy that stage Agarwal had holed out against Lyon for 77. Virat Kohli gloved Hazlewood down the leg side just after the break. But Pujara just kept doing what Pujara does. Indian fans call him The Wall in reference to Rahul Dravid. That\u2019s not quite right. For one, there\u2019s a tiny gap between bat and pad that Jimmy Anderson pilots the ball through like a drone at Gatwick airport. Australia\u2019s bowlers haven\u2019t been able to find it.\nFor another, though his trademark is obduracy, Pujara does open up once set. It\u2019s just that getting set for him is a matter of two sessions. In the third he often came down the wicket to Lyon, tucking ones or whipping fours. His best from Starc was a cut shot from close to the body, on one foot at the point of contact, hands in tight and scything.\nThe cut is the closest Pujara has to a flourish. His hundred came off Starc too, suitably unmemorable off the pads through backward square. Pujara tried an air-punch to celebrate, but even there he had the sheepish demeanour of a great uncle trying to negotiate the latter half of a wedding playlist.\nNot many current batsmen average 50, but their numbers just swelled by one: Pujara took his mark back over the threshold and will remain there even if he\u2019s dismissed. \u201cIf\u201d rather than \u201cwhen\u201d. In terms of deliveries this series he\u2019s faced 246, 204, 103, 11, 319, 2, and now 250 and counting. He\u2019s entirely capable of batting through another day for an Indian declaration or as last man standing. What he looks like while doing it doesn\u2019t matter. Every shred of respect he receives this series has been earned.",

        "content": "A fans collective comprising of eight separate Newcastle United supporters groups and fanzines have joined forces to write an open letter to the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, urging him to either sell up or provide Rafael Ben\u00edtez with the transfer market funds needed to ensure Premier League survival.\nThe 757-word missive implores Ashley \u201cto do what is right this month\u201d. In an ideal world that would involve the sports retail tycoon offloading the club to a \u201csuitable\u201d purchaser willing to meet his \u00a3300m asking price but with takeover talks with assorted, opaque, groups seemingly at an impasse, the letter\u2019s authors ask him to relax the purse strings.\n\u201cIf you cannot find a suitable buyer, then it is imperative you release the funds needed to improve the squad,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cTo fail to do so, would seem both reckless and foolish given the damage you know relegation will do.\n\u201cAs things stand, Newcastle are just two points above the relegation zone and the manager has pleaded for new signings in order to ensure the club avoids a third relegation in the 12 years you will have been on Tyneside.\n\u201cOur net spend in the last three transfer windows is the lowest in the Premier League \u2026 there have been three chunks of television income paid in that time totalling more than \u00a3150m.\u201d\nThis lack of investment, and reinvestment of broadcast revenues, currently seems set to see Ben\u00edtez step down as manager in May when his current contract expires. The former Liverpool coach has fallen in love with the club and the city but remains deeply frustrated that he was not allowed to properly restock his squad last summer. Instead Newcastle ended that last transfer window having recorded a \u00a320m trading profit.\n\u201cGiven the sale of Aleksandar Mitrovic to Fulham (for \u00a322m) last summer, there must be money available to spend on players unless it is being taken out of the club by yourself to repay some of the interest free loans you have provided since 2007?\u201d the letter continued.\nAccording to Newcastle\u2019s last set of available accounts published in summer 2017 Ashley has provided the club with a total of \u00a3144m in interest free loans since buying it in for \u00a3134m in 2007. It is understood that, during the last 18 months, he has recouped at least \u00a310m worth of these arrangements.\n\u201cIf you refuse to spend money this month, the risk of relegation not only increases, it will also mean the manager will not sign the new contract you have offered him. You have repeatedly said you want Ben\u00edtez to stay, so do the things needed to make sure that happens. In short, back him and give him what he needs. We firmly believe keeping Ben\u00edtez is the best chance this football club has. So please listen to him and please allow him to sign the players he has requested to improve the team. It is in your own interest to do so.\u201d\nEarly last month, Ashley made an extremely rare television appearance to declare that he was closer than he had ever been to selling Newcastle.

        "content": "Group wants powerful watchdog that could jail negligent housing managers\nThe survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire are calling on the government to overhaul the way social housing is regulated and set up a powerful watchdog that could jail negligent housing managers.\nThey want changes as radical as those made to oversight of the banking industry after the 2008 financial crash and have described the current system as \u201cthe dog that didn\u2019t bark\u201d.\nNatasha Elcock, the chair of the survivors and bereaved group Grenfell United, has told supporters of plans for \u201ca movement to ensure that people up and down the country are listened to and are heard and are in a safe environment\u201d.\nMembers of the group have made contact with residents\u2019 associations at other social housing blocks and are calling on tenants to sign up to residents associations to start to amplify their voices.\nAsked about the initiative, the housing secretary, James Brokenshire, appeared to be receptive and told the Guardian he wanted to make social landlords more accountable to tenants and was conscious of the \u201cneed to increase regulation\u201d.\nGrenfell residents told the first phase of the public inquiry into the fire that Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation repeatedly ignored their concerns about the standard of workmanship during a refurbishment that involved wrapping the tower in combustible materials.\nEd Daffarn, who escaped from the 16th floor, warned eight months before the fire that \u201conly a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord\u201d.\nDaffarn is now driving the move for more urgent reform of the social housing sector as part of Grenfell United. He is also a member of an independent social housing commission set up by Shelter, the housing charity, alongside the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi. It will publish a report next Tuesday that is expected to echo the Grenfell families\u2019 demands for new regulation.\nDaffarn said the current housing ombudsman and social housing regulator were opaque organisations not widely known by tenants. \u201cWhat we feel let us down at Grenfell was the lack of scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were safe in the knowledge nobody was going to scrutinise them.\u201d\nGrenfell United wants senior managers to have a statutory responsibility to keep tenants safe and a more proactive regulator that targets problems rather than simply responds to complaints.\n\u201cHousing associations have seen what happened at Grenfell and are behaving in the same way,\u201d Daffarn said. \u201cThe change in culture won\u2019t come about because of the impact of Grenfell, it will come from policy and regulation. We can see so many similarities between the banking industry, which was unregulated and had a crash, and a housing sector that had Grenfell. Regulating housing should be 50 times more important that regulating banks.\u201d\nThe public inquiry into the disaster will rarely sit this year, causing concern that momentum for reform could wane. Lawyers for the building companies and the council landlords involved in the refurbishment of the tower are being given time to trawl through more than 200,000 documents being disclosed before the second stage of the inquiry, which will scrutinise the management of the tower, communications with residents, its refurbishment and fire safety.\nThe inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said in December that the hearings were unlikely to start before the end of 2019.\nThe campaign for new regulation is a further sign that the bereaved, survivors and residents are opening a new chapter in their activism nearly 19 months after the fire in June 2017, which claimed 72 lives.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s key isn\u2019t that Grenfell is remembered for what happened before the fire, but for the change we achieved after the fire,\u201d said Daffarn. \u201cWe are looking to change the culture around social housing and the institutional indifference it entails. Grenfell United has come to believe that can be achieved through a two-pronged attack \u2013 tenants\u2019 voice and regulation.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cGrenfell wouldn\u2019t have happened if we had been heard and respected \u2026 People are still not being listened to.\u201d\nBrokenshire said he was \u201cstruck by the need for clear and effective redress in the area of social housing and ensuring tenants are able to hold their landlords to account\u201d.\n\u201cThat message of tenant voices is very, very relevant in ensuring proper standards are maintained and that where things are going wrong they are picked up and addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a theme I am very conscious of when we look to the future of regulation around social housing.\u201d\nThe government is expected to publish a white paper on social housing this year, which is expected to contain proposals for a new system of regulation.",

        "content": "Medics say limiting families not the answer for a country where a baby is born every 15 seconds\nIn the cramped office of New Cairo hospital\u2019s family planning clinic, Safah Hosny sets a box overflowing with contraceptives next to the visitors\u2019 ledger on a small desk.\nThere are eight condoms for one Egyptian pound, about 4p, or ampoules of injectable birth control, for just under 9p. A contraceptive implant lasting three years costs 22p, while copper IUDs \u2013 the most popular form of birth control on offer according to Dr Hosny \u2013 cost 17p.\nThe low prices, far less than in any Egyptian pharmacy, are due to subsidies provided by Egypt\u2019s health ministry, as clinics like Dr Hosny\u2019s are on the frontline of Egypt\u2019s battle against an exploding birthrate. A government programme called \u201ctwo is enough\u201d has been launched to encourage people to limit family size. From this month, the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly recently announced, the government will cease to provide financial support to a family after their second child.\nThe five-year, $19m (\u00a315m) programme comprises a poster campaign as well as growing a network of mobile and fixed family planning clinics across Egypt. Posters covering the walls of Egypt\u2019s metro show an Egyptian 50-pound note, worth about \u00a32.20, torn into five. \u201cWould you rather divide this into five, or into two?\u201d it asks.\nBut the price and availability of contraceptives at clinics like that in New Cairo hospital belie a wider issue: that Egypt has a long way to go in persuading its people.\n\u201cSometimes patients arrive here knowing absolutely nothing about contraception, so I have to explain all the different methods,\u201d says Hosny. \u201cThen [the woman] chooses, with her husband\u2019s permission. Her husband is normally here for the first visit, and witnesses her signing a consent form which shows she understands, but then she is alone for the follow-up appointments.\u201d\nHosny says the clinic is happy to serve unmarried women. \u201cFor unmarried women I suggest the pill or injections,\u201d she says, pulling out a slide of contraceptive pills.\nPopulation size is now regarded as such a crisis by the government that President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi declared at a 2017 conference: \u201cWe have two real challenges facing our country: terrorism and overpopulation.\u201d\nEgypt now has more than 104 million people, including 94.8 million inside the country. A baby is born every 15 seconds in the country, meaning it ranks 13th in terms of global population. This has placed strain on already scarce resources such as water, and could amplify existing problems for families already struggling to put food on the table following a 2016 financial crisis that led Egypt to devalue its currency and sparked rising inflation. According to Egypt\u2019s official statistics agency, the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, 27.8% of Egyptians live below the poverty line.\nYet \u201ctwo is enough\u201d risks failing to target the things that could make a real difference when families, particularly those from Egypt\u2019s working class, are deciding to have children. The campaign will increase sex education for some medical professionals, but will not begin a programme of sex education in schools, currently non-existent. It also ignores options for women with unwanted pregnancies, with abortion seen as a legal grey area in Egypt.\n\u201cI think it has to be multi-disciplinary thing,\u201d says Dr Hussein S Gohar, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Yosri Gohar hospital in Cairo. \u201cYou have to start in schools to educate young kids about sex education, contraception and the hazards for themselves, as well as the future of the population explosion. Then they have to target people about to get married, and married people. But if you\u2019re going to make legislation punishing them for a third child, then you have to provide an exit route for them, by allowing medical termination or even abortion clinics.\u201d\nThe heart of the problem, according to Gohar, means thinking about what motivates people to have large families in Egypt. \u201cYou need to change the mentality of the people and how they see things rather than just telling them what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go to people once every few months and say the population is too large and there\u2019s not enough water so you need to have a smaller family.\u201d\nDr Ahmed Fathy, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at New Cairo hospital, agrees. \u201cFor poorer families, it\u2019s not about whether a child is a gift from God, but rather [that] extra children are a method of income,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re a family with a farm, extra workers cost more money. But if you have more children, one can look after the animals, another can look after the machines, and another can tend to the plants.\u201d\nThe Egyptian government\u2019s best efforts may also fail to reach more conservative doctors in rural areas, who are more likely to convey the message to patients that every child is a blessing, or to limit information about contraception. \u201cThe fact is that in every country, the government can\u2019t cover the entire spectrum,\u201d says Dr Natalia Kanem, head of the UN Population Fund, which has partnered with Egyptian ministries for the \u201ctwo is enough\u201d campaign. \u201cPrivate providers can misinform, or even perform so-called medical female genital mutilation. Our job is to flood real information here to counter the myths.\u201d\nA mushrooming and overwhelmingly young population disadvantages young women according to Kanem, who cites the fact that 62% of the Egyptian population is aged 29 or younger. \u201cIf you have a young population, those young people tend to have children young as their mothers were young, so you see an acceleration,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless women are able to make a conscious decision to have a child later, to marry later.\n\u201cWhen girls are left behind, half the population is left behind.\u201d",

In total, 190.9m books were sold last year, for \u00a31.63bn. The Bookseller magazine said this was up \u00a334m on 2017. Volume also increased, although more marginally, with an extra 627,000 books sold last year.\nBecoming was the most valuable title of the year, according to the Bookseller: taking \u00a37.7m in sales, it topped the charts for four consecutive weeks and took the Christmas No 1. But it was not the year\u2019s bestselling book: Becoming was outsold in the non-fiction market by Adam Kay\u2019s memoir about life as a junior doctor, This Is Going to Hurt, and by 2018\u2019s overall top seller, Gail Honeyman\u2019s debut novel Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine.\nThe Bookseller\u2019s editor Philip Jones said the growth was \u201canother glitch in the eye of those pundits who thought physical books would go the way of the CD, DVD or even vinyl. The turnaround at Waterstones \u2013 once owned by HMV of course \u2013 and the continuing success of the smaller chains such as Blackwell\u2019s, Daunt and Foyles, and the large numbers of independent bookshops shows how the high street might yet be saved by proper customer-centric retailing.\u201d He identified Trump as the major trend in non-fiction, with the year bookended by Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and Becoming.\nIn fiction, he said, so-called \u201cup-lit\u201d \u2013 uplifting fiction \u2013 was \u201cthe counterpoint to the wider gloom\u201d, led by Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine. The Nielsen figures do not include ebooks and audiobooks, and Jones said he expected that both of these sectors had also grown over the last year, \u201cparticularly the audiobook market, which is really on the charge\u201d.\n\u201cWhen you consider the Nielsen-measured print-book market alongside all those bits of the sector we do not have numbers for \u2013 including direct sales, sales though bargain bookstores or the discount supermarkets, the secondhand market, plus digital \u2013 it is pretty clear that the book is the unassailable leader of the entertainment pack,\u201d he said.\nLiterary agent Jonny Geller responded to the news on Twitter: \u201cWe punch well above our weight as an industry and cultural light and must continue to invest in writers and writing. Believe in the power of books.\u201d\nHe told the Guardian that he had been struck by the range of bestsellers in 2018: \u201cPublishing is a great shop window of one of this country\u2019s greatest exports \u2013 creativity. We tend to underestimate the power of our writers internationally as more UK-originated material becomes TV and films and dominates bestseller lists abroad.\n\u201cPrint sales underpin publishers\u2019 profits, so let\u2019s hope they use that to invest in new and innovative voices in 2019 \u2013 and share the newfound spoils with the writers in a flourishing audio sector.\u201d",

It\u2019s based on investigators\u2019 supposition that he will hinder the investigation process. We are asking for bail instead,\u201d Zherebenkov told Reuters.\nOn Thursday, a Russian news outlet claimed Whelan was arrested just minutes after receiving a USB drive that contained the names of people employed at a top secret state organisation.\nCiting a security service source, Rosbalt news agency said the 48-year-old American received the USB drive from a Russian citizen who visited him in his room at the Metropol hotel in Moscow on Friday. Officers from the FSB intelligence agency then reportedly burst into the room and arrested Whelan. The information could not be independently verified by the Guardian. Rosbalt did not say what had happened to the Russian citizen.\nThe news agency said that according to its source Whelan began making contact with potential Russian informants on internet forums and chatrooms about 10 years ago. He would then, the source said, meet up with his online acquaintances individually in Moscow \u201cover a bottle\u201d.\n\u201cThe US citizen tried to determine if his acquaintance possessed information that could be of interest to American intelligence services, or if anyone in his close circles had access to such information,\u201d read the Rosbalt report. The news agency often cites unnamed security service sources in its articles.\nWhelan\u2019s brother, David, told the Guardian: \u201cWe have not had any details from the state department about the circumstances of Paul\u2019s arrest.\u201d\nA social media page apparently belonging to Paul Whelan on VK, or VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook, contains at least one clear reference to a visit to Moscow, as well as a number of short Russian-language messages such as \u201cHappy Victory Day\u201d and \u201cForward, President Trump\u201d.

I haven\u2019t seen him since then,\u201d the VK friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThis time I was not aware that he was in Russia until I sent him my Christmas greetings on the 25th, and he responded saying that he\u2019s in Moscow, and that he plans to go to St Petersburg next.\u201d\nZherebenkov said his client was holding up well and had a good sense of humour.\nThe US ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, visited Whelan in prison on Wednesday, a move described as \u201ca rookie mistake\u201d by one Russian foreign policy analyst.\n\u201cHe should have sent a career consular officer,\u201d said Vladimir Frolov. \u201cAn ambassadorial visit by a political appointee escalates the situation and raises the stakes, makes it harder to resolve the situation.\u201d\nHuntsman has been US ambassador to Russia since October 2017.\nA state department spokesperson said: \u201cAmbassador Huntsman expressed his support for Mr Whelan and offered the embassy\u2019s assistance.

        "content": "The lives of refugees detained by the Australia government on remote Christmas Island are the focus of a powerful yet poetic new documentary\nFive years ago, Gabrielle Brady, an Australian film-maker, decided to visit an old friend who had moved to remote Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. The tiny tropical Australian territory was only settled a century ago, when phosphate, deposited as guano by seabirds, was mined by Chinese and Malay labourers. Its latest industry, however, was the controversial \u201coffshore processing\u201d of refugees. For the past 17 years, asylum seekers reaching Australia\u2019s shores by boat have been dispatched to island detention centres and detained there indefinitely.\nBrady\u2019s arrival on holiday gave her friend, Poh Lin Lee, a break from her difficult job on Christmas Island, providing therapy for traumatised detainees. \u201cWe spent two weeks enjoying this beautiful environment \u2013 diving with dolphins, looking for whale sharks, going to really remote beaches,\u201d remembers Brady, who now lives in Berlin. \u201cAt the end, Poh said: \u2018I need to show you something.\u2019\u201d They slashed their way through dense jungle with machetes (\u201ceverywhere you go on Christmas Island, you need a machete\u201d) to reach a lookout. Below spread the grey buildings of the huge camp for refugees. \u201cIt was just truly shocking,\u201d says Brady. \u201cI\u2019d seen that image so many times in the Australian media, but I\u2019d forgotten it existed.\u201d\nThis revelatory mix of horror and beauty \u2013 and Lee\u2019s growing reservations about her job \u2013 drove Brady to return to the island five times over the next four years, making her powerful, discombobulating debut feature, Island of the Hungry Ghosts. Instead of a familiar focus on the life stories of traumatised refugees, Brady\u2019s film is a lyrical, dream-like journey into darkness. It offers no contextual information via voiceover or even captions; instead, the camera lingers on brooding rainforest, the spooky dinosaur-like rattle of tropical birds, and the extraordinary migrating land crabs (whose respectful treatment by the island authorities contrasts with that of the human arrivals).\nThe film\u2019s core is Lee\u2019s life and therapeutic work as one of four counsellors employed by Australia\u2019s department of health at the island hospital. The film started small, she says, when she and Brady decided they wanted to secretly document detainees\u2019 stories. Brady met them inside Lee\u2019s consulting room, unbeknown to the guards posted outside the door, and gauged their willingness to be filmed. Although by agreeing they risked punishment or being transferred to other island camps, \u201cthere was huge interest,\u201d says Brady. \u201cI was meeting people who had been there for four or five years. There was a huge sense of desperation.\u201d\nIt was dangerous for Lee as well, with the Australian government having introduced a draconian law threatening whistleblowers with two years\u2019 imprisonment. Lee took the chance. \u201cIt was far more important to document the stories at that stage,\u201d she says, by phone from Nice, where she now lives with her French husband and two children. \u201cThe risk I faced was nowhere near what the asylum seekers risked.\u201d\nIn therapy with Lee, refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere discuss their treatment in detention, rather than the conflicts they have fled \u2013 a deliberate decision to avoid re-traumatising them. She worries about the impact on them of being constantly asked to retell their \u201ctrauma story\u201d. \u201cWhen I discussed these concerns with Gabrielle we realised it wasn\u2019t the kind of storytelling we wanted to invite. We offered therapeutic work and if something came out that would contribute to the film, that was secondary.\u201d\nIn fact, Brady ended up filming more extensively only once some asylum seekers had been transferred to the Australian mainland. She and Lee felt their subjects could offer fully informed consent once they had access to legal advice, unmonitored emails and more personal freedom. These scenes, Brady insists, are not re-enactments but a continuation of Lee\u2019s therapeutic work. \u201cAt times we were filming in retrospect but the moment itself, particularly the therapy sessions, are very genuine. I haven\u2019t touched them as a director. It worked creatively and it was the only way to have done it with real permission,\u201d she says.\nThe film also follows Lee into intimate corners of her family life as she struggles with her participation in the system that is abusing them. Family camping trips in Christmas Island\u2019s national park look idyllic but are suffused with foreboding. How did Lee experience life in such a strange place? \u201cWhen we first went there, it was quite sparkly and enticing. I\u2019ve never swum on coral reefs that are completely undamaged. As we were there longer and started to realise that none of the Chinese or Malay community would leave the village area after dark, then we understood more about the history. There was this new layer of heaviness. At the end, I had a sense that the island holds so many lost, wandering spirits.\u201d\nThe film\u2019s digressions into island folklore frustrated one critic, who labelled it \u201can all-too-pretty but information-deficient documentary\u201d. Audiences with no knowledge of the well-established cruelty of Australia\u2019s refugee policy \u2013 condemned by the UN and Amnesty International but with widespread support in Australia, and maintained by all main political parties \u2013 will not learn many facts from the film.\nBut Brady wanted not merely to show her audience the refugee story; she wanted them to feel it. The film\u2019s opacity and slow pace throw viewers into a state of uncertainty that mirrors \u2013 very mildly, of course \u2013 the plight of incarcerated refugees. \u201cI wanted to dislocate the audience \u2013 you don\u2019t know where you are until a certain point in the film,\u201d she says. \u201cCinema is like a trip that you are taken on. I wanted it to be a sensorial experience. That\u2019s what implants something inside you \u2013 not information and context.\u201d\nIt was hard to sell this vision. Brady worked for four years unpaid, living in a caravan in Berlin. \u201cIt was difficult to pitch the project avoiding this box that it would be a refugee film \u2013 an information-driven expos\u00e9. It was hard for people to grapple with.\u201d She only received a small amount of funding in Australia \u2013 from Screen Territory \u2013 and eventually funded the film in Europe and also produced a more informative short film for the Guardian). Both Brady and Lee give the impression of being exiles from their home country. \u201cAustralia is a politically suffocated place at the moment,\u201d says Brady. \u201cI don\u2019t feel welcome.\u201d\nThe Christmas Island detention centre was quietly closed last October. Since filming, one refugee has published a book of poetry and others are training to be dentists and lawyers; nevertheless, all but one of more than 20 detainees who appear in the film remain in limbo on temporary visas, unsure if they will be allowed a future in Australia. Brady made an Australian edit concealing their faces because she fears they could still be \u201cpersecuted\u201d by authorities. Setting aside the abuse, both Brady and Lee view indefinite detention as a disastrous own-goal for Australia. \u201cI was meeting people at the top of their game \u2013 incredibly smart, multilingual,\u201d says Brady. \u201cThese would be the sorts of people you would want in your country.\u201d\nLee, who now works with refugees in European countries including Turkey and Greece, is sure the system worsens trauma. \u201cPeople process and recover by re-engaging in life, relationships, hopes and dreams. When people arrived on Christmas Island, they had come from unspeakable horror, but they were alive and engaged. Had they been welcomed into a community and given opportunities to work, we wouldn\u2019t see these intensive ongoing effects of trauma. We\u2019re creating a whole community of people who will be dependent on mental health services for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n Island of the Hungry Ghosts is released on 11 January in the UK, and 7 March in Australia",

A reading above 50 indicates growth.\nThe latest snapshot revealed construction companies hit a weaker patch during the last month of 2018 as new orders increased at a relatively subdued pace, while there were some reports that wet weather disrupted work.\nThe slowdown largely reflected softer activity in the commercial sector at a time of rising uncertainty for businesses considering building projects with less than 90 days to go before Brexit.\nTim Moore, the economics associate director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cSubdued domestic economic conditions and an intense headwind from political uncertainty resulted in the weakest upturn in commercial work for seven months.\u201d\nHoward Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said: \u201cSome companies\u2019 willingness to commit to major new projects at this stage is being limited by Brexit uncertainties and concerns over the economy.\u201d\nWhile activity faded in December, strong demand for residential property among first-time buyers helped support the levels of work for housebuilders, while civil engineering activity rose at the quickest rate since May 2017.\nDespite concerns over delays to major civil engineering projects, such as the building of Crossrail in London, analysts said construction companies would be hoping the government would push to get other infrastructure projects up and running this year.\nCompanies in the PMI survey reported improved confidence in their outlook for construction activity for the year ahead, although economists said activity would likely remain subdued amid labour shortages.\nMax Jones, a construction specialist at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cWhile December was marked by further political uncertainty, the main challenges likely to be keeping construction bosses awake at night are more sector-specific, such as delays to projects being signed off and ongoing concerns about labour supply.\u201d",

In 2016 the library, which is a volunteer-run charity, was threatened with eviction from the building in Southwark where it has been housed for three decades, when the council announced it would begin charging rent \u2013 increasing its costs from a \u00a312,000 annual service charge to \u00a330,000 a year.\nA petition signed by 16,000 people and a \u201cread-in\u201d protest from the public led to a reprieve, but the building is now due for redevelopment, with the library needing to leave the premises in spring 2019.\nWhile an alternative space in Peckham was found by Southwark council, the library needed to raise at least \u00a330,000 to finance the move. Almost 800 supporters have now helped it to raise the funds, with library staff now looking for a further \u00a312,000.\nFundraising coordinator Magda Oldziejewska said the extra \u00a312,000 would cover additional costs, including archival storage, blackout curtains and painting and decorating. Staff are also looking for volunteers to help sort through a backlog of 4,000 uncatalogued book donations ahead of the move.\nOldziejewska said the library was \u201cimportant today more than ever because it has one of the most unique collections of feminist materials \u2026 It is also one of the very few spaces on a mission to save feminist herstories. Over the last couple of years, [it] has saved thousands of items \u2013 books, periodicals and archives \u2013 in donations from individuals and organisations, including some who were having real difficulties finding a willing repository for their collections, which might have otherwise been lost to future generations of feminists,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping to be able to work with many local groups in Peckham after our relocation and are looking forward to our move and getting to know our local community.\u201d\nIn 2012, the Women\u2019s Library, an archive of women\u2019s history founded in 1926, was threatened with closure, but was saved when the London School of Economics stepped in to house it.",

        "content": "Ireland planning as seriously for no deal as for May\u2019s agreement, says Leo Varadkar\nThe Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said his country is preparing for a no-deal Brexit as seriously as it is for Theresa May\u2019s deal and warned that the EU\u2019s existing offer must not change.\nIn remarks that echoed EU comments earlier on Thursday rebuffing British hopes of further talks, Varadkar said European leaders were united behind the existing deal and that he and Angela Merkel had held a 40-minute call at her request.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November,\u201d he said.\nThe taoiseach said he had \u201cgiven up speculating\u201d on whether Britain would leave the EU without a deal but that Ireland\u2019s contingency planning for a no-deal outcome would continue.\nHis warning that preparations for no deal have escalated will sharpen pressure on May before the crucial parliamentary vote in mid-January. The Irish agriculture minister, Michael Creed, said earlier on Thursday he would be asking for emergency EU aid for Irish farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nMay has been ringing EU leaders ahead of the Commons vote but has so far seen little movement as a result of her Christmas telephone diplomacy.\nVaradkar said Irish and British government officials would be speaking by phone on Friday, Reuters reported. He said the calls would be followed up with \u201cdirect contact\u201d between the two prime ministers as needed.\nBut a European commission spokeswoman said talks could not be reopened. \u201cThe deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible and the EU27 leaders confirmed on 13 December [at an EU summit] in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I understand for now, no further meetings are foreseen between the commission\u2019s negotiators and the UK\u2019s negotiators, as negotiations have indeed concluded.\u201d\nAn EU source said nothing had happened regarding Brexit over the last 10 days, though May had spoken with the head of the European council, Donald Tusk, on Wednesday. The prime minister spoke to the German chancellor twice during the holiday period.\nJean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, does not appear to have been on the list for a Christmas phone call from May, but the commission spokeswoman said he was \u201calways available to listen to Prime Minister May\u2019s views with regards to the temporary nature of the backstop\u201d.\nThe British government is pushing for further guarantees on the Irish backstop, the fallback plan to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. With only 85 days until Brexit, the last-ditch push for guarantees has intensified concern about the damaging effects of the UK crashing out without a deal.\nCreed said Ireland\u2019s demand for aid from Brussels in the event of no deal would be substantial. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at hundreds of millions,\u201d he told the Irish Independent. \u201cBetween the beef industry and the fishing industry we\u2019re talking mega-money.\u201d\nEU law allows emergency aid for farmers affected by sudden market shocks; the EU released more than \u20ac1bn to help farmers cope with Russia\u2019s 2014 ban on imports of EU produce. But officials said they would only respond to a formal request from the Irish government, if the UK left without a deal.\nOn Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the British government needed more certainty that the UK would not be trapped in the backstop indefinitely. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anything new, but we are asking you to define what temporary means so we can have confidence we\u2019re not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever,\u201d Hunt said.\nThe EU\u2019s reluctance to reopen talks is not just a holding line over the Christmas holidays but reflects the deeply held view among officials that the bloc has gone as far as it can in offering reassurance on the backstop.\nAt an EU summit in December, EU leaders agreed that the backstop would \u201capply temporarily unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement\u201d to ensure that a hard border would be avoided. The text also stated that if the backstop were triggered, EU negotiators would use \u201cbest endeavours\u201d to negotiate a replacement agreement.\nEU officials say this document has significant legal weight because it is the formal conclusions of a European summit. None of them think that a different legal format \u2013 for example, depositing the text on the backstop at the United Nations \u2013 would make any difference to the chances of the Brexit withdrawal deal passing the House of Commons.\n\u201cThere is a general frustration with the whole process. We have worked very hard for the last 18 months,\u201d said one EU source. \u201cWe have compromised, we have done a lot to get this nailed down on time.\u201d\nEU leaders were said to be irritated by May\u2019s remarks at the December summit that British MPs did not trust the EU.\nReflecting that mood, Juncker told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag last week that British MPs deeply distrusted the EU and the prime minister. He said the EU had no intention of trying to keep the UK inside the EU, adding: \u201cAll we want is clarity about our future relations and we respect the result of the referendum.\u201d\nIn the interview he also said the EU would be ready to open talks on the future relationship with the UK \u201cthe very next day\u201d after any positive vote by the UK parliament, not waiting until Brexit day on 29 March.\nMeanwhile, May\u2019s renewed attempts to woo the Democratic Unionist party have been rejected again after a lunch between the prime minister and Nigel Dodds, the party\u2019s deputy leader.\nA statement released by Dodds said May\u2019s draft EU withdrawal agreement flew in the face of government commitments on Northern Ireland.\nHe emphasised the party\u2019s concerns over the proposed backstop, saying: \u201cNo one wants a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic \u2026 With this clarity emerging in London, Dublin and Brussels, there is evidently no need for this aspect of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d",

He finished last of the five starters on his seasonal debut and seventh of 10 at Kempton, folding rapidly in the latter contest after a mistake at the 13th fence to cross the line 37 lengths behind the winner, Clan Des Obeaux.\nThe horse was reported to have bled from a nostril after the King George but Henderson has now decided to repeat an operation performed in 2016 to cauterise Might Bite\u2019s palate.\n\u201cWe have not heard any noises [during morning exercise],\u201d Henderson reported via a blog post. \u201cBut after considerable discussions with our experts they suggest this may be the best course of action. It is not a 100% cure but eight times out of 10 it is respiratory, so it makes sense to go ahead with the procedure.\u201d\nHenderson added that while Might Bite \u201cappeared to bleed last time, I\u2019m not sure that it was quite enough to stop him, but if there is any shortage of oxygen getting to a horse, you are obviously putting pressure on the lungs, which can causing bleeding.\u201d As a result, it is \u201cperfectly reasonable to expect the two issues to tie in together, so that is the line of thought and our conclusion to the matter.\u201d\nMight Bite had an 80-day break before his brave effort behind Native River in last year\u2019s Gold Cup but arrived at Cheltenham on the back of a victory in the King George rather than a flop.

        "content": "For decades universities have been falling down on the job of teaching people to think for themselves and selling themselves as trainers for enhanced income generation. It is an abomination if, as George Monbiot reports (Who is really making your choices? It may not be you, 31 December), they are supporting research into techniques for overcoming resistance to advertising. We should look to other institutions to provide reservoirs of resistance. They will not be specifically set up to combat the \u201chidden persuaders\u201d that Vance Packard wrote about in 1957, but by groups who build community on other common interests.\nPerhaps the most successful is the Campaign for Real Ale, which took on the global beer producers who told us what to drink. My own city has many fine pubs, traditional and modern, which are obvious centres of resistance and not just on the beer front. What some will find more surprising is that there are some church communities around that encourage people to develop a capacity for scepticism, while helping them to stand up to the powerful forces of 21st-century global capitalism.Geoff ReidBradford\n George Monbiot\u2019s warnings about the insidious power of advertising research being funded by publicly funded universities are well-made. We should remember that David Cameron was motivated by this growing body of research in establishing the Downing Street behavioural insight or \u201cnudge\u201d unit \u2013 allegedly aimed at exploiting the better side of human psychology with a view to improving citizens\u2019 behaviour (such as sending n tax returns on time). Manipulating the behaviour of unsuspecting individuals was a wholly accepted premise. Indeed, the main nudge theorist, an American economist, won a Nobel prize in 2017, so his work has already had a considerable impact on a global scale. At a time when higher education is being commercialised like never before, with the financial stakes rising year by year, we must give the highest priority to the ethical scrutiny and control of publicly funded research and the individuals engaged in it.Gillian DalleyLondon\n George Monbiot is right to point up the aggressive efforts on the part of corporations to control consumer responses. But he is too sweeping in tarring \u201cuniversities\u201d as a whole as contributing to this process. It is mostly business schools that conduct such research. Having worked for some decades in such establishments, I can confirm that apart from some lip service to wider social concerns, usually in areas such as business ethics, international management or (some aspects of) corporate social responsibility, the main purpose of most business school activity \u2013 and of the vast majority of research funding in the field \u2013 is to improve the success of individual organisations, without regard to wider implications. We need more academic regard, and more funding, devoted to the broad philosophical, social and political impacts of business if we are to see a brake on the corroding influence of modern advertising techniques.Paul GriseriLa Genetouze, France\n George Monbiot highlights an often hidden and insidious aspect of modern capitalism. In the early days of capitalism, advertising was used to simply make the wider public aware of a product, but with modern technology and psychological sophistication this has morphed into a highly persuasive operation, plugging in to human \u2013 and particularly children and young people\u2019s \u2013 weaknesses.\nI remember when I first went to live in East Germany, long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, how the \u201cgrey\u201d reality, so tediously iterated in the west, represented for me a freedom from unnecessary and intrusive advertising. I found it wonderfully refreshing. I could think my own thoughts, daydream and just observe the world of architecture, people\u2019s activities and my whole environment untrammelled by gaudy, in-your-face hoardings and sexually exploitative imagery. Of course, there were the ubiquitous simplistic political slogans, but they were less obtrusive than commercial advertising and had little, if any, effect on a sceptical populace.\nNow it is not just hoardings, of course, but social media technologies that dominate our daily lives and corporate interests plug directly into our brains, creating addictions as pernicious as cocaine or opium. How quaint does the Big Brother concept in Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four seem in contrast.John GreenLondon\n George Monbiot is quite right to complain about academics doing research that helps advertisers manipulate minds. But universities suffer from an intellectual and humanitarian scandal far worse than Monbiot seems to realise. Most would agree that a proper basic aim of academia is to help promote human welfare by intellectual, educational and technological means. If this aim was taken seriously, and pursued rationally, academia would give intellectual priority to the tasks of articulating our problems of living, including our global problems, and proposing and critically assessing possible solutions \u2013 possible actions, policies, political programmes, ways of living.\nIntelligent public education about what our problems are, and what we need to do about them, would be an absolute priority. The pursuit of knowledge and technological knowhow would be important, but secondary. No university in the world is organised along these lines. All take the first priority to be to acquire specialised knowledge.\nAll around the world universities, in their whole structure, betray reason and, as a result, betray humanity. At present we do not have what we so urgently need: institutions of learning rationally devoted to helping us learn how to make progress towards a better, wiser, more civilised world.Nicholas MaxwellEmeritus reader, Department of science and technology studies, University College London\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

On Thursday it was overtaken by Google\u2019s owner, Alphabet, as the world\u2019s third-largest listed company, after more than $60bn (\u00a347.5bn) was wiped off its market value, taking it back below $700bn.\nThe gloomy news from the maker of the iPhone and the iPad came after trading closed in New York on Wednesday but triggered selling in Asian and European markets. Major share indices in Paris and Frankfurt dropped by more than 1.5% while the FTSE 100 in London closed 41.57 points lower at 6692.66.\nWhen business resumed on Wall Street, the gloom was deepened by comments from Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser noting that Apple would not be the only casualty of the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers, said in an interview on CNN. \u201cThere are a heck of a lot of US companies that have sales in China that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\u201d\nHassett\u2019s remarks came as a closely watched gauge of American manufacturing showed new orders falling by 11 points \u2013 its biggest drop in almost five years. Analysts said the ISM survey dovetailed with similar snapshots of Chinese and eurozone industry.\n\u201cWe always believed 2019 would be a tougher year as the economy battles against more headwinds \u2013 namely the lagged effects of higher borrowing costs, the stronger dollar, the fading support from the 2018 fiscal stimulus and weaker external demand at a time of rising trade protectionism\u201d, said James Knightley, an economist at ING.\nHe added that the poor survey data coupled with the turmoil on the financial markets made it likely that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, would slow the pace of interest rate increases in the coming year. \u201cIndeed, it is consistent with our view that the Fed will probably pause its policy tightening in the first quarter.\u201d\nThe admission by Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, that the worse than expected sales in China had come as a surprise led to falls in the share prices of other companies seen as exposed to weaker Chinese demand.\nIn London, the luxury brand Burberry closed down nearly 6%. Concerns that slowing growth in China would reduce demand for metals hit mining firms, with Rio Tinto, BHP, Glencore and Antofagasta down between 1.3% and 4.8%.\nCompanies supplying components for Apple devices also got clobbered, with the Cardiff-based chip manufacturer IQE closing down more than 6%.\n\u201cApple reiterates worries that China and trade issues have not been resolved,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, the chief investment strategist of SlateStone Wealth in New York.\n\u201cPeople are worried that if a big name such as Apple has to report a decline in earnings, who else can be protected from something like that?\u201d\nRobin Li, the chief executive of Baidu, the Chinese search engine, echoed Cook\u2019s warning, reportedly writing in a letter to staff that \u201cwinter is coming\u201d.",

        "content": "Still here. Micky Mellon uses the words repeatedly when discussing Tottenham\u2019s visit to Tranmere and, though unlikely to excite the club\u2019s marketing executives, they reinforce what Friday\u2019s third-round FA Cup tie means to those who have endured and survived a torrid period at Prenton Park. Tranmere are still here, as Mauricio Pochettino et al will soon discover, but it was a close-run thing.\nShowpiece occasions and stellar Premier League opponents are nothing new to the club that reached the FA Cup quarter-finals three times between 2000 and 2004, the League Cup final in 2000 and the Championship play-offs three times in the mid-1990s. Friday night games under the floodlights at Prenton were once a regular occurrence too. Then came a dramatic and almost catastrophic slide featuring consecutive relegations that cost them their Football League status. Three years in the National League followed with, at the second time of asking, promotion secured via the play-off final and one of the most compelling contests of last season.\nMellon, a popular midfielder at the club during those cup runs and manager since 2016, was under no illusions about the magnitude of May\u2019s final against Boreham Wood. \u201cWe would have been in a bit of bother,\u201d he says of the implications of remaining a National League club for a fourth year. Despite the careful and committed ownership of Mark and Nicola Palios debts inevitably increased outside the Football League. \u201cThen you go down to 10 men after 48 seconds of a play-off final,\u201d Mellon recalls of Liam Ridehalgh\u2019s first-minute dismissal for a two-footed foul. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. Your football life flashes before your eyes.\u201d\nThe 10 men triumphed 2-1, Tranmere endured and Spurs are their reward.\n\u201cFriday night is party night in Birkenhead and now it has got a football game to add to the spice,\u201d says Mellon, who has guided the club to ninth in League Two. \u201cIt\u2019s about the whole of the football club showing the whole football world that Tranmere is still here. We disappeared off the Football League radar for a while and when you have three years out of the league you can lose generations of fans. You can stop being a big football club. But we have seen in the last few years with trips to Wembley, occasions like this and the promotion battles that Tranmere is still here. It still has a fan base that, when called upon, can sell out in three hours.\n\u201cIt has unbelievable potential and it is up to us as a football business to make sure that we keep the momentum going forward. Friday night will help that.\u201d\nMellon has faced several of what he describes as crossroads games in his two years as manager. The second-round replay on 17 December at Southport, live on television and the team\u2019s second away game in three days, was the most recent. But it did not compare with the pressure of May\u2019s play-off final.\n\u201cIf I think back to the two years when we had a run at getting promotion, the opportunities to get the players who were the right ones to get us out of the league were getting tougher. We were becoming less of a catch, if you like. That was going to happen every year and also what was happening every year we didn\u2019t get promoted was that we were losing good players. Other teams were picking us off. It happened again when we got promoted so that didn\u2019t really remedy anything.\n\u201cIt would have been very difficult for us and we were aware of that. We were getting smaller as a business every year we were not in the Football League. We were losing more and more staff and I was aware that would have had to happen again if we didn\u2019t win. But thankfully we don\u2019t have to think about that now.\n\u201cWe are in the process of growing again as a club and we are gaining staff and retaining staff, which is important.\u201d\nSpurs\u2019 televised visit will be worth around \u00a3500,000 to Tranmere, who will be backed by a sell-out crowd of 13,300, but their manager insists the value of the tie cannot be measured purely in monetary terms.\n\u201cIt helps not just financially but it\u2019s about announcing that we are still here,\u201d Mellon says. \u201cIt is about putting Tranmere back in the eyeline of football people. The finances help because, although the club is very well run by some fantastic owners, the Palioses, and I really mean they have done terrifically well, I\u2019m not just saying that to keep my job, it will help rebuild the damage that has been done around the club.\n\u201cI mean physical damage to parts of the stadium that need to be repaired. This is very much a community club. The stadium is used all the time by the local community and it has been deteriorating. So we will be able to add to that and I get support all the time I need to bring in players. For a whole host of reasons this tie is massive for us.\u201d",

The owners of both airports invested millions of pounds in the equipment after about 140,000 passengers were affected by the unprecedented disruption to Gatwick.\nThe military had to be called amid a series of reported drone sightings over the course of three days, and it is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can detect and jam communications between a drone and its operator, was deployed.\nWhile it would not say exactly what equipment had been installed since then, a spokeswoman for Gatwick said the airport\u2019s owners had bought a system that provided a similar level of protection and had installed it about a week ago. Heathrow\u2019s spokeswoman also confirmed that the reports of investment in military-grade anti-drone equipment at that airport, which first appeared in the Times on Thursday, were accurate.\nOn Wednesday, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that it had withdrawn its resources from Gatwick, though a spokesman said the armed forces \u201cstand ever ready to assist should a request for support be received\u201d.\nIt is understood that the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, chaired a meeting on Thursday morning at which defence chiefs, the police and Home Office officials discussed future plans for dealing with the threat of drones to vital infrastructure.\nThe parliamentary undersecretary of state for transport, Liz Sugg, is also due to meet the heads of the UK\u2019s major airports next week to discuss the states of their own defences, as well as what they plan to put in place in future, the Guardian understands.\nThe airports are expected to announce significant investment in further anti-drone systems, though not all will necessarily be in the form or on the scale of those deployed at the two London airports.\nThe Drone Dome system is capable of tracking the devices from as far as six miles away. As well as being able to sever communications with the operator, some models can also destroy the drones using a laser beam. The model reportedly procured by the UK military does not have such a capability.\nAccording to the Times, a spokesman for the system\u2019s manufacturer, Rafael, confirmed that there had been significant interest in the product from various authorities in the UK and in other nations, but declined to confirm whether Gatwick had bought one.\nA spokeswoman for Heathrow airport said: \u201cThe safety of our passengers and colleagues remains our top priority. Working closely with relevant authorities including the Met police, we are constantly looking at the best technologies that help remove the threat of drones.\u201d\nReferring to the disruption at Gatwick, the chief constable of Sussex police, Giles York, said last week that officers had received 115 reports of sightings in the area, including 93 that had been confirmed as coming from \u201ccredible people\u201d including a pilot and airport staff.\nSome reports of drones in the area may have involved the police\u2019s own craft, he said, but he added that he was \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d that a drone was flying near the airport\u2019s runways during the three-day disruption. Police are still searching for those responsible.",

        "content": "It has taken a while but, for richer or poorer, the Rugby Football Union has finally taken the plunge and made a long-term commitment to its top female players. If the announcement of 28 professional 15-a-side contracts is not a strictly ground-breaking development, the implications are sizeable.\nNot for nothing did Simon Middleton, England\u2019s head coach, describe the RFU\u2019s move as revolutionary or his captain, Sarah Hunter, call it a huge day for all concerned, even though full-time deals already exist in sevens and were briefly introduced for XVs players before the 2017 World Cup, then subsequently withdrawn. This time RFU officials insist they are in for the long haul.\nThe timing is slightly ironic given the recent cost-cutting at Twickenham, caused in part by an unforeseen overspend on the redeveloped East Stand. According to the RFU\u2019s Nicky Ponsford, however, this fresh investment will prove worthwhile. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a sustainable model which will carry us through to 2021 and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been our long-term ambition and shows the RFU\u2019s commitment to growing the game and its belief in the future of the sport.\u201d\nFigures suggest rugby is among the country\u2019s fastest-growing female sports, with twice as many women and girls playing regularly at a club compared with 2014. World Rugby also says there has been a 60% increase in participation globally since 2013, with women making up a quarter of all players worldwide, and a crowd of 17,440 attended the Six Nations game between France and England in Grenoble\u2019s Stade des Alpes last March.\nAgainst this backdrop pressure has been building on the RFU to do the decent thing and allow England\u2019s players the same scope to prepare and recover as their male counterparts. \u201cIt\u2019s something I didn\u2019t think would probably happen in my playing career,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely significant. As players it means our focus can now be solely on becoming the best we can be.\u201d\nThe top women\u2019s XVs players in New Zealand and France now operate on a semi-professional basis but nowhere else in the world are permanent full-time deals of this type in place. It hardly creates a level playing field globally but England, having won one Six Nations title in the past six years after choosing to focus much of their energy on sevens, will happily settle for world domination.\n\u201cWe want to become the No 1 side in the world again and we want to win the 2021 World Cup,\u201d said Middleton bluntly. \u201cThis offers us a massive opportunity but with it comes massive expectation. It\u2019s up to us to do everything we can to meet that expectation.\u201d\nProfessionalism also involves ensuring the numbers add up. The RFU is refusing to reveal precise financial details but it is understood the fattest annual contract is worth a relatively modest \u00a328,000, with sponsorship and match fees on top. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable we\u2019re in the right ballpark compared to other unions and other women\u2019s sports,\u201d Ponsford said. \u201cI don\u2019t think financial sacrifice came into the conversations.\u201d\nAmy Cokayne, however, will continue to combine rugby with her RAF duties and no Lamborghinis or Ferraris will be rolling off the forecourts. Any prospect of England\u2019s top men taking a big pay-cut \u2013 they are currently paid \u00a323,000 per match \u2013 in a gender-neutral act of solidarity also currently feels remote. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any comments about what the men\u2019s team earn,\u201d Ponsford said.\n\u201cThe important thing is that the RFU have made a commitment to the women\u2019s game and are looking to support it in the longer term.\u201d\nThere is no contract for the centre Amber Reed, currently injured, or the prop Heather Kerr but for the vastly experienced Hunter and Katy Daley-McLean, both capped more than 100 times, this day is deserved reward for their long years of unpaid toil.\nForwards\nZoe Aldcroft (Gloucester-Hartpury Womens RFC)Sarah Beckett (Firwood Waterloo Ladies)Sarah Bern (Bristol Bears Women)Hannah Botterman (Saracens Women)Jo Brown (Loughborough Lightning)Rowena Burnfield (Richmond FC)Shaunagh Brown (Harlequins Ladies)Bryony Cleall (Saracens Women)Poppy Cleall (Saracens Women)Amy Cokayne (Wasps FC Ladies)Vickii Cornborough (Harlequins Ladies)Lark Davies (Worcester Valkyries)Vicky Fleetwood (Saracens Women)Sarah Hunter (Loughborough Lightning)Justine Lucas (Loughborough Lightning)Cath O' Donnell (Loughborough Lightning)Marlie Packer (Saracens Women)Ellena Perry (Saracens Women)Abbie Scott (Harlequins Ladies)\nBacks\nJess Breach (Harlequins Ladies)Rachael Burford (Harlequins Ladies)Katy Daley-Mclean (Loughborough Lightning)Abby Dow (Wasps FC Ladies)Zoe Harrison (Saracens Women)Tatyana Heard (Gloucester-Hartpury Womens RFC)Natasha Hunt (Gloucester-Hartpury Womens RFC)Claudia Macdonald (Wasps FC Ladies)Sarah McKenna (Saracens Women)Leanne Riley (Harlequins Ladies)Emily Scarratt (Loughborough Lightning)Emily Scott (Harlequins Ladies)*Kelly Smith (Gloucester-Hartpury Womens RFC)Lydia Thompson (Worcester Valkyries)Lagi Tuima (Bristol Bears Women)Carys Williams (Loughborough Lightning)",

        "content": "It was the night Manchester City made it clear they have no intentions of relinquishing their grip, finger by finger, on the Premier League trophy.\nPep Guardiola and his players will cling to the belief that this victory could be a decisive blow and, at the very least, it has clipped back Liverpool when they were threatening to pull away.\nIf City were to prolong the argument, it was imperative they found a way past the leaders. Even a draw would have felt like a grievous setback for the reigning champions and, when Roberto Firmino nodded in Liverpool\u2019s equaliser, approaching the midway point of the second half, a lesser side than City could conceivably have wilted under the pressure.\nNot this team, though. As the song goes, City fight to the end and it was not just their competitive courage to conjure up a decisive goal, courtesy of Leroy San\u00e9, that delivered a message. It was the spirit of togetherness displayed by Guardiola\u2019s players in that nerve-shredding finale when Liverpool started pumping balls into the penalty area.\nOn one hand City have not kept a clean sheet during their past 11 fixtures. On the other it was a show of collective defiance during those fraught moments when Liverpool had Virgil van Dijk operating as an extra centre-forward. City gave everything to defend their lead, in the way that true champions do. They dug in, they formed an impenetrable blue line and, when it needed the ugly stuff, they were happy to oblige. In the process they made it clear to their opponents it is going to be one hell of a battle between now and the end of the season.\nFor Liverpool the priority must be not to wallow in self-pity. It is, after all, only a month ago that City were five points clear and looking capable of turning the title race into a procession. Liverpool still have a four-point cushion and, if they need encouragement, there is only one other club in history who has reached the new year unbeaten and not gone on to win the league \u2013 and that was Sheffield United in the 1899-1900 season.\nLiverpool will, however, reflect that the night could have taken a very different complexion but for an astonishing goalline clearance from John Stones. And J\u00fcrgen Klopp should be aggrieved that, having made it 1-1, his players left themselves so stretched when San\u00e9 collected Raheem Sterling\u2019s pass and fizzed a diagonal shot past Alisson to score via the far post.\nPerhaps Liverpool might have been better to employ more restraint once Andrew Robertson, the game\u2019s outstanding performer, had turned Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s long cross into the six-yard box for Firmino to equalise with a stooping header. It is difficult to be too critical after such an absorbing game but Liverpool lost their shape at the key moment and San\u00e9 punished them with a brilliantly angled finish.\nKlopp also made the point that, with the game goal-less, Vincent Kompany was fortunate to be shown only a yellow card for a scything challenge on Mohamed Salah.\nCity certainly rode their luck at times and never more so than when Salah played Sadio Man\u00e9 through the middle, the shot thudded off the post and for a split-second, as Stones\u2019s first attempt to clear the danger came back off Ederson and started looping towards an exposed net it felt as if the entire stadium held its breath, anticipating an own goal.\nThe technology showed nine-tenths of the ball had crossed the goal-line \u2013 but not the final tenth. Stones had somehow got back to hook the ball away, brilliantly, from beneath his crossbar and City were spared by a matter of millimetres.\nWhen Liverpool watch the replays they will barely comprehend how Stones\u2019s final swing of the ball missed Salah, from point-blank range, when even the merest of touches would have resulted in a goal.\nCity made the most of their fortune and, when Sergio Ag\u00fcero put them into the lead, five minutes before half-time, it was a reminder that the truly great strikers tend to save their best for the big occasions.\nBernardo Silva did the build-up work on the left and for the first time Ag\u00fcero had manoeuvred a yard for himself inside the penalty area. He was still left with an acute angle, shooting left to right, with an outstanding goalkeeper to beat in the shape of Alisson. Ag\u00fcero had nicked the ball in front of Dejan Lovren but still had his opponent in close proximity.\nIt was the kind of shooting opportunity, on the half-turn, that many strikers would have passed up, concluding that the chances of scoring were too remote. His finish was a beauty \u2013 swivelling on the spot and connecting with power and precision. The ball was still rising as it soared between Alisson and his near post and City had the breakthrough they craved.\nThat goal continued Ag\u00fcero\u2019s record of having scored on all seven occasions he has faced Liverpool in league fixtures at this stadium. More importantly, it gave the home team an element of control when, until that point, Liverpool had seldom looked in trouble. Robertson had been coping with Sterling, Alexander-Arnold had the speed and agility to match San\u00e9 and, until that piece of brilliance from Ag\u00fcero, it was unusual to see City finding it so difficult to create chances.\nEqually, the same could be said of Liverpool for most of the game and, if City\u2019s supporters had any apprehension about seeing Danilo and Aymeric Laporte operating as their team\u2019s full-backs, it was gone by the end.\nLiverpool\u2019s 20-match unbeaten run was over and, for City, the title race had opened up with new possibilities.",

And the 34-year-old found the net in Spanish top-flight action for the first time since scoring for M\u00e1laga in a 1-1 draw at Osasuna on 23 April, 2012, when he put Villarreal ahead after four minutes on Thursday night.\nCazorla bent a wonderful shot into the bottom corner to ignite a game rescheduled due to Real\u2019s participation in last month\u2019s Club World Cup. But the European champions struck back three minutes later with a headed goal from Karim Benzema after a sweeping attacking move. Rapha\u00ebl Varane gave the visitors the lead in the 20th minute with a header from a free-kick but Cazorla had the final say when he ghosted into the box undetected to nod home at the back post and give his side a deserved point in the new coach Luis Garc\u00eda Plaza\u2019s first home game in charge.\nGareth Bale was withdrawn at half-time in another blow to Real, having appeared to struggle with a possible left calf complaint late in the first half.\n\u201cIt could be said the result was fair,\u201d Real\u2019s coach, Santiago Solari, said. \u201cWe chased the victory and had it in our hands. We wanted to kill the game off and they put us under a lot of pressure as they were at home and they badly needed the points. When Gareth came off we lost a bit of sharpness in attack, we still had the chance to score a couple but we needed to attack with more clarity.\u201d\nVillarreal, who have reached the last 32 of the Europa League despite a dire domestic season, clawed their way out of the relegation zone to 17th in the standings, level on points with 18th-placed Athletic Bilbao. \u201cThis result will give us strength,\u201d said Garc\u00eda, who has taken two points from two games since succeeding the sacked Javi Calleja. \u201cI imagine that every game from now on will be a battle, a war to survive, but hopefully we\u2019ll come through it and this point gives us a big emotional boost.\u201d",

That\u2019s up 11% compared to a year earlier.\nIt means CEOs working average 12-hour days would only have to clock in for 29 hours in 2019 to earn the median \u00a329,574 of British staff.\nThe figures have prompted criticism from both unions and shareholder groups.\nThe GMB\u2019s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: \u201cIt\u2019s sickening. Three days into the year and fat cat bosses have already made what average workers will earn all year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, and it makes no sense in how we value people\u2019s contribution to society and it makes no sense for the economy \u2013 I don\u2019t know any care workers who squirrel their wages away in offshore accounts, they spend it in their local areas and on paying their bills.\u201d\nFrances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also slammed \u201cgreedy executives\u201d she said were \u201ctaking more than they\u2019ve earned\u201d.\n\u201cToo much wealth is being hoarded at the top,\u201d she said, adding that reforms were needed to bring executive pay \u201cback down to earth\u201d.\nShareholders have also taken aim at overpaid executives, with 63 companies including Royal Mail, Persimmon and Unilever facing investor rebellions over pay last year.\n\u201cThis is a result of shareholders feeling they are not being listened to,\u201d said Andrew Ninian, the Investment Association\u2019s director of stewardship and corporate governance.\n\u201cCompanies need to do more to respond to shareholder concerns and ensure pay rewards align with company performance and remain at levels that are justifiable to shareholders.\u201d\nA \u00a375m bonus pocketed by the boss of Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, eventually resulted in his ousting in November following an earlier investor backlash.\nLast summer Royal Mail suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts in UK corporate history when around 70% voted against its pay package for its CEO, Rico Back, worth up to \u00a32.7m. This was on top of a \u00a36m \u201cgolden hello\u201d for him having left the company\u2019s European subsidiary.\nThe CIPD and the High Pay Centre are calling for a major overhaul of how executive pay is set in the UK.\nThe two bodies say corporate remuneration committees, which decide executive pay levels within each company, should be more diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity and professional background in order to combat group-think.\nThey are also calling for long-term incentive plans, which tend to dole out performance-based bonuses every three years, to be replaced with a less complex system based on a basic salary and a small restricted share award.\nExecutive performance should also be based on benchmarks including employee wellbeing and workforce training, which the High Pay Centre and CIPD say are \u201ccrucial for good corporate governance\u201d.\nCIPD\u2019s chief executive, Peter Cheese, said: \u201cExcessive pay packages awarded by remuneration committees represent a significant failure in corporate governance and perpetuate the idea of a \u2018superstar\u2019 business leader when business is a collective endeavour and reward should be shared more fairly.\n\u201cThis imbalance does nothing to help heal the many social and economic divides facing the country.\u201d",

They appear to show a significant jump from August last year, when nearly 50,000 single parents were reportedly facing a drop in benefits due to the cap.\nThe benefit cap, which limits the total amount households can receive in benefits to \u00a320,000 a year, or \u00a323,000 in Greater London, was envisaged as an \u201cincentive\u201d to persuade unemployed people to move into work.\nCritics claim it is forcing many people into poverty and resulted in social cleansing because rents in inner-city areas are so high.\nLabour claims the statistics show ministers are failing to assess the impact of their policies upon vulnerable children.\nThe shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said single mothers were being pushed into poverty by the cap.\n\u201cThe Conservatives have pushed ahead with their austerity agenda with scant regard for the impact on low-income families,\u201d she said. \u201cLabour will build a social security system that is there for any of us in our time of need.\u201d\nThe latest figures were released on the DWP\u2019s Stat-Xplore site in November and include statistics showing the number of men and women whose benefits were capped up to August of last year.\nThe latest figures also show that 120,297 single claimant women had their benefits capped, compared with just 13,743 single claimant men over the same period. The vast majority of those women had dependent children.\nThe latest disclosure follows other recent studies which found that the cap was leaving more people in debt and pushing poor children further into poverty.\nA study of more than 10,000 benefit-capped households by the Policy in Practice consultancy found that for every child whose parents moved back into work as a result of the cap, eight more would grow up in families whose financial circumstances worsened following the introduction of the policy.\nMore than half of the households affected by the benefit cap were left stuck on it for six months or more. The average gap between rent and housing benefit for families stuck on the cap was \u00a33,750 a year.\nPioneered by the former chancellor George Osborne, the cap limited total benefits to \u00a326,000 per year at its introduction in 2013. It was then cut in November 2016 to the present levels, quadrupling the number of families affected.\nThe DWP did not respond to a request for comment.",

What was that summer? What had gone wrong there?\u201d\nCox\u2019s death is dealt with only briefly in the Channel 4 film, which focuses instead on the Vote Leave campaign and in particular its provocative leader Dominic Cummings, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. \u201cAnd I\u2019m absolutely not attributing [her murder] to anything we portray,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBut something obviously goes wrong when a political question is asked, and that happens.\u201d\nThe film, entitled Brexit: The Uncivil War, has attracted controversy since it was first announced last year, with supporters of both campaigns fearing it would present a one-sided view.\nOthers, including the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who has reported on the leave campaign\u2019s use of data analytics, have argued that a fictional film is inappropriate given that Vote Leave and other leave campaigners have been reported to police after the Electoral Commission found they had broken the law.\nSpeaking at a screening ahead of its broadcast next week, Graham \u2013 an acclaimed playwright who frequently focuses on recent political history \u2013 said he had expected his film to provoke strong reactions: \u201cI didn\u2019t go into this blindly. I realise people feel very strongly about this, and the consequences of that decision, whatever your politics, are very real and very serious.\u201d\nBut he had been surprised by those who questioned the drama\u2019s right to exist at all, he said. \u201cAs inquiries continue, and in some cases police investigations, of course people don\u2019t want to disrupt that. I understand that, but I disagree. I think it is absolutely possible to tackle a story and leave some things to one side for another day. But you have to start at some point, and the idea that you have to wait until Brexit is over \u2013 when the hell is that going to be? A century\u2019s time?\u201d\nThe highly entertaining two-hour drama shows Cumberbatch\u2019s Cummings devising an anarchic campaign that dismays the establishment figures on his own side as much as it unsettles the opposing remain campaign, led by Craig Oliver, played by Rory Kinnear. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Nigel Farage and the millionaire businessman Arron Banks also all feature, with the MPs, in many cases, providing the comic relief.\nCummings is shown settling on the slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d and the figure of \u00a3350m (\u201cHow much does it cost us each week to be members of the EU? Biggest number wins\u201d) which would be emblazoned on the side of the campaign\u2019s bus. \u201cDominic Cummings is basically mental \u2013 he\u2019s just an egotist with a wrecking ball,\u201d says the Craig Oliver character at one point.\nBut the film also dramatises the frustration of voters who feel they have been ignored by the political class, particularly in one scene in which a focus group spills over into angry argument and tears. Reviews so far, on both sides of the political spectrum, have been enthusiastic.\nGraham, whose previous plays include the parliamentary drama This House, Ink, about the birth of the Sun newspaper, and the Channel 4 drama Coalition, said the real life Cummings had not yet seen the finished drama, but that after being initially uncertain about the project, he had been \u201chappy to let us get on with it\u201d.\nTo the question \u201cwill anyone be able to watch this entirely neutrally, the answer of course is no\u201d, Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m quite pleased so far that some people who think I treated Dom like a hero or like an antichrist have no idea which one is true. We all come to it with our own baggage, and that is entirely expected and entirely right.\u201d\n Brexit: The Uncivil War is on Channel 4 on Monday 7 January at 9pm",

        "content": "A trip back to 1953 at Bloomfield Road, tricky ties for Fulham and Leicester, and plenty of minnows with eyes on a big scalp\nThe story of the 1953 Charity Shield wasn\u2019t too dissimilar from the story of the 1953 FA Cup final. Stan Mortensen was on target for Blackpool, but his teammate Stanley Matthews ran off with the man-of-the-match plaudits. Yet the tale wasn\u2019t an exact facsimile: despite the heroic efforts of the two Stans, Cup winners Blackpool lost the Shield to league champions Arsenal. The veteran Tommy Lawton was on the scoresheet for the Gunners that day, and, pass that crowbar please, the modern-day Arsenal have similar star strikers on which to call: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, the increasingly impressive Alex Iwobi. Setting aside Aubameyang\u2019s inexplicable hoick over the bar from a yard out at Anfield, and Arsenal\u2019s continued travails at the back \u2013 no clean sheet in six \u2013 whoever gets the nod up front for the visitors should decisively make hay against hosts who have lost four of their last six and shipped two goals against non-league Solihull Moors in the last round. Will the Unai Emery era begin with FA Cup No 14? Or can the Seasiders reprise their recent performance at the Emirates in the League Cup \u2013 when they were a linesman\u2019s flag away from completing a two-goal comeback \u2013 and give the Gunners something to worry about? SM\nIn the weeks after Tranmere won promotion back to the Football League, having already lost top scorer Andy Cook to Walsall, the fear was that the burden on James Norwood would be too great. But after scoring the winner at Wembley in May, Norwood has relished his role as Rovers\u2019 go-to man, scoring 18 since August, propelling his side to within touching distance of the play-offs. The worry for Tranmere now is losing Norwood, with the 28-year-old out of contract this summer. Norwood has the perfect opportunity to impress suitors higher up the ladder on Friday evening, with an audition against a likely experimental Spurs back line under the lights at Prenton Park. \u201cBig evenings like Tottenham will go a long way to seeing us keep moving forward,\u201d said manager Micky Mellon. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some dark times and hit rock bottom.\u201d BF\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the fuss about it, we\u2019re going to turn up here, get absolutely smashed and I\u2019m going to go home and get on with my life again,\u201d said Alan Dowson, the Woking manager, in an interview last week. Maybe the magic of the Cup is lost on Dowson, or moreover perhaps it is just a touch of mind games, an attempt to relax his players before facing Premier League opposition. Woking, second in the National League South, are the lowest-ranked team left and warmed up for Javi Gracia\u2019s Watford with a 3-0 win over Hampton and Richmond on Tuesday. Greg Luer, the former Hull youngster, hit a hat-trick in that game, while Ben Gerring, an October arrival, captained Truro City to the first round last season. Five leagues may separate the teams but, after sending Swindon packing in the last round, Woking, whose assistant manager is the Sky Sports commentator Martin Tyler, may just quietly fancy their chances of another upset against a team that are almost certain to make wholesale changes. BF\nIpswich Town\u2019s recent FA Cup record is staggeringly bad. They last advanced to the fourth round in 2009-10 and have since lost eight consecutive third-round ties. Anchored to the bottom of the Championship, 10 points from safety and with two wins to their name all season, there is little to suggest they will stop the rot against Accrington Stanley, who are just 12 places below Saturday\u2019s visitors in the league standings. While maintaining Ipswich\u2019s Championship status is manager Paul Lambert\u2019s priority, he told reporters at his pre-match press conference he would travel to Accrington \u201cas strong as I can\u201d. Even so, Stanley manager John Coleman is unlikely to be fazed but has conceded his own team haven\u2019t been playing too well either. \u201cWe are like Jekyll and Hyde at the moment, not in our performances but in our results, so this is an opportunity for us to get back on track,\u201d he said, before pointing out that funds generated by a 2003-04 Cup run helped get Stanley into the Football League. Advancing to the fourth round for only the third time since the collapse of the original Stanley in 1966 could land them a similarly lucrative jackpot. BG\nHow Lincoln City must have been rubbing their hands together at Everton\u2019s recent wobble. Marco Silva\u2019s side must do battle with the League Two leaders, impeccably led by the Cowley brothers, after five defeats in eight matches, the latest a chastening loss to Leicester. At Lincoln, the mood could not be more contrasting. The 6ft 5in Yerry Mina, if he plays, will meet his match in Matt Rhead and John Akinde, a pair of burly strikers who will be determined to make life difficult. As well as Akinde, prolific since arriving from Barnet in the summer, Lincoln boast guile in the shape of Shay McCartan, the talented Northern Ireland forward. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to playing at Goodison Park against a massive club,\u201d McCartan said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting teams coming to us [in the league] and raising their games. And now we\u2019ve got the chance to do that.\u201d BF\nThese two have quite the FA Cup pedigree. They\u2019ve won it six times apiece, a total only bettered in history by Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa. Only problem is, all the good work was done an awfully long time ago. Newcastle lifted their sixth FA Cup in 1955, while Blackburn completed their collection in 1928, having won their other five in the 19th century. So No 7 is well overdue. More recent results \u2013 just three wins between them since the start of December \u2013 suggests the long wait is likely to go on, whoever prevails. But history can be a blessing as well as a burden: Newcastle beat Blackburn on their way to the 1910 and 1952 FA Cups, while Rovers saw off the Toon during their one successful 20th-century run. The winners are therefore permitted to brazenly ignore the current form-book and take a firm clutch of the good old Comforting Straws Of Precedence. They feel real nice, don\u2019t they. SM\nNewport County saw off Welsh rivals Wrexham in emphatic style to earn themselves a plum home tie and the welcome windfall that comes with it being shown live on the BBC. In last season\u2019s fourth round, Tottenham\u2019s players clearly didn\u2019t fancy the conditions on a cold January night at Rodney Parade and were extremely lucky to escape with a draw before winning the replay in the more familiar surroundings of Wembley. Given their current Jekyll and Hyde status there\u2019s every chance Leicester could come a cropper, but Michael Flynn\u2019s side will need to up their game considerably, having won just three of their past 15 games in League Two. BG\nMichael Jolley worked as a corporate bond trader for six years, in London and New York, but ultimately did not find life in banking fulfilling. Born in Sheffield and educated at Cambridge University, when he returned to England to pursue a career in football he volunteered in Crystal Palace\u2019s academy as he embarked on earning his coaching badges while working in the city part-time. On Saturday Jolley will return to Selhurst Park as manager of Grimsby Town, more than a decade on from helping the likes of Sean Scannell, John Bostock and Victor Moses graduate through the ranks. Jolley is working with a palette of different youngsters these days, with Harry Clifton and Elliot Embleton, the Sunderland loanee and England Under-20 international impressing this season. Grimsby will arrive full of confidence, having hoisted themselves up to mid-table in League Two after four wins from their last five. BF\nHaving seen off non-League outfits Hampton & Richmond and Maidstone United in the preceding rounds, Oldham Athletic will have the chance to slay a top-flight side when they travel to a Fulham team currently preoccupied with Premier League survival. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side should still be too good for an outfit currently sitting in mid-table three divisions below, but having knocked Liverpool out as a League One side six years ago, the Latics will fancy their chances. Currently without a manager after club legend Frankie Bunn was controversially dismissed on the back of a 6-0 Boxing Day defeat at the hands of Carlisle, Oldham are on something of a roll under caretaker Pete Wild, who has masterminded back-to-back wins against Port Vale and Notts County. An outsider in the betting to become the next manager, should he do the same against Premier League opposition he could surely stake a legitimate claim for being given the job full time. BG\nA trip to Ashton Gate is just about the last thing David Wagner needs right now. With Premier League safety undoubtedly the priority for his flailing team, a duel with a resurgent Bristol City side \u2013 unbeaten in eight \u2013 that fared so well against top-flight opposition en route to the Carabao Cup semis last season has the hallmarks of an uneasy ride. For the likes of Josh Brownhill and Lloyd Kelly, influential for the Robins this season, it is another chance to shine. City beat Manchester United, Watford and Crystal Palace last year and in Famara Di\u00e9dhiou, who recently became a father for the second time, they have a striker returning to form. \u201cI sent him a gif of Romario and Bebeto [celebrating] for Brazil and I thought that might just plant that seed in his head to get the goal,\u201d said his manager, Lee Johnson, after the Senegalese opened the scoring in a 2-0 win at Stoke on New Year\u2019s Day.

        "content": "Alienation, ennui and romance: Interpol\u2019s music has always conjured images that are more about New York\u2019s mythology than its reality\nI am lying on the sand at Sydney\u2019s Cobblers beach in the early 00s, half-asleep in the sun. A friend hands me her Discman and says, \u201cListen to this band. The guy keeps singing about streetlights and girls, but in a good way. And apparently everything is about New York.\u201d\nThe CD was Interpol\u2019s Turn on The Bright Lights, a post-punk album throbbing with inspiration from Joy Division and the Psychedelic Furs. From the opening of reverb-soaked guitars on Untitled, I was transported to a world far from my sunny outlook \u2013 the New York night. I had passed through the looking glass into a noirish atmosphere of alienation and ennui. But among the bleak textures there was also a sense of romance, conjured by the lush production and Paul Banks\u2019s haunting vocal style. I was able to form images of New York that belonged more to a mythology of the city than any real experience.\nIn songs like Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down, with its dreamy character portrait and driving bass line, Interpol echoed what F Scott Fitzgerald and Patti Smith had already suggested to me about New York. It is a place of quick and restless adventure, where the blinkers of taxis hold the restless eye in a pause; where it is possible to follow poor lovers along 13th street and watch them disappear under eaves into unknown rooms; where conversations take place until dawn, wild conversations about how all of the world\u2019s art belongs to the New York night, where every creative act can somehow be understood beneath the enchanted streets.\nIf that sounds a little much, maybe Interpol aren\u2019t for you. Their vision of New York asks you to suspend knowledge of the wholesale destruction and clinical real estate development of what were once artistic enclaves. Today, in the Trump era, aspiring musicians are unlikely to encounter the likes of Lou Reed or Klaus Nomi in a downtown bar. Instead they\u2019ll have to shield themselves from trust fund kids pretending not to flash their Patek Philippes and Wall Street types telling incomprehensible jokes about quaaludes.\nIn the post-9/11 world, the song NYC expressed the detachment and vulnerability of trying to navigate the new century, one in which suicide bombers could murder thousands in a city that housed the United Nations, and the growth of digital media meant the reconfiguring of relationships. I listened to it on repeat, on the beach at 3am, and then later sprawled out drunk under blue gums in Gundagai, far from New York itself. When Banks sings, \u201cI\u2019m sick of spending these lonely nights / Training myself not to care / The subway is a porno,\u201d it felt like a window onto that city\u2019s subterranean soul. Underground, the city is stripped of its sheen, naked and dirty. The song captures the particular melancholy that accompanies being lost among millions of other restless lives.\nOver the last 16 years, Interpol have released five other albums, including the recent Marauder, which they are currently touring in Australia. Their songs have continued to evoke images and moods of New York City, some more explicit than others. On Next Exit, the opener on Antics, an eerie church organ swells to the point where the drums kick in, as if banging on a grand old door: \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to the city / Goin\u2019 track this shit around / And make this place a heart / To be a part of again.\u201d The melodies on No I in Threesome and Pace is the Trick, both from Our Love To Admire, capture storied midnights of whisky and valium, where figures seem to stumble from Central Park onto the Upper West Side to catch a glimpse of neon. On Same Town, New Story, from El Pintor, Banks sings that it \u201cFeels like the whole world\u2019s coming down on me / Wide eyed, venture so slowly.\u201d\nIn a 2014 interview, the band was asked about their relationship to New York in the 21st century, with its glassy condominiums and cookie-cutter architecture. Drummer Sam Fogarino said that although the city had changed dramatically, \u201cthere\u2019s still something about New York. As soon you step on the sidewalk, you\u2019re fucking in New York. It\u2019s still pure. Everywhere you look, everywhere you walk \u2026 It\u2019s still the best fucking city in the world, no matter what phase it\u2019s going through.\u201d\nEven at a vast distance, covered in a mask of sea-spray, Interpol allow me to inhabit the world of old New York, as if I was behind the camera with David Wojnarowicz in the late 1970s, or shooting hoops with Jim Carroll on the Lower East Side. Listening to their cinematic hooks, I become an anonymous figure in a great dark metropolis.\n Interpol are playing in Melbourne on Friday 4 January at Sydney on Saturday 5 January",

Alongside the image of the wrapped pistol are the words, \u201cWhat\u2019s under your tree this year?\u201d\n\u201cI would like to see the billboard taken down,\u201d Stewart told the ABC.\nAd Standards ruled the advertisement breached community standards on health and safety because there are strict rules about proper storage and handling of guns, and \u201cthe panel considered that this image is a depiction of material that would be contrary to law\u201d.\n\u201cThe panel considered that the product is legally allowed to be advertised ... and that there is not a prohibition on advertising firearms per se,\u201d the Ad Standards ruling said.\n \u201cThe panel noted that leaving a firearm unsecured or under a Christmas tree is incorrect storage of a firearm and is illegal.\u201d\nOne complaint noted that the advertiser\u2019s logo was an image of Australia and a target. They raised concerns that the billboard, placed on a main road through a predominantly migrant community on Brisbane\u2019s southside, was a \u201cracist\u201d message and played into the rhetoric of protecting Australia. Ad Standards considered this complaint but found the billboard did not breach its standards on discrimination or vilification.\nOne of the complainants, Susan Cullinan, told Guardian Australia she had been appalled by the advertisement and welcomed the Ad Standards ruling.\n\u201cI saw [the billboard] as an attempt to normalise gun ownership and glamorise it. The only people who would benefit was the arms industry,\u201d Cullinan said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of Australia\u2019s arms restrictions and our culture. We need to fight commercial interests that are trying to relax the laws. We do need to continue to speak up just to avoid becoming like America.\n\u201cI was so encouraged by the number of other people who were shocked and took the time to complain.\u201d\nGun World Australia was contacted for comment.\nThe business submitted to Ad Standards that its advertisement did not \u201cdepict any material country [sic] to prevailing community standards on health and safety\u201d.\n\u201cGun World does however support appropriately licensed members of the public engaging in safe, ethical hunting and the recreational use of firearms in Queensland.\u201d\nAd Standards noted in a detailed published decision that Gun World Australia had not responded since the ruling.\n\u201cAd Standards will continue to work with the advertiser and other industry bodies regarding this issue of non-compliance,\u201d it said.\nIt is not the first time that Gun World Australia\u2019s billboards have provoked controversy. In 2017 it used an image of a gun-toting woman dressed as Santa. The then-called Advertising Standards Bureau dismissed complaints that the image linked firearms sales with children, on the grounds that Santa appealed to all ages.\nGuardian Australia reported in April that the business advertised the Victrix bolt-action rifle, which is classified in Australia for hunting and sport, but marketed in the US for military and law-enforcement uses.",

He reflects on his father\u2019s murder, Fraser Anning\u2019s speech and the close Muslim friend who helped him through his darkest hour\nThree years after the worst day of his life, Alpha Cheng picks his words with care.\nThe 31-year old schoolteacher speaks out \u2013 sometimes. He talks about what he knows: racism, his friends and what happened to his father. In October 2015, Curtis Cheng was leaving work at Parramatta police station when he was shot and killed by a 15-year-old boy claiming to act for Islamic State.\nIn the years since, there have been trials, inquests and people telling Cheng \u2013 in what they think is a compliment \u2013 that they could not have done what he has done. In 2016, he wrote to Pauline Hanson and told her to stop using his father\u2019s death to attack Muslim migration. This year, after senator Fraser Anning called for a return to the White Australia policy, he did the same.\n\u201cIf anyone should be spiteful at Muslims, many would say that it would be me,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201c[But] I am tired of needing to explain to adults that the actions of these individuals cannot be attributed to an entire group of people.\u201d\nOne of his closest friends, Qais Mohammed, is a Muslim. They became friends the same way anyone does in late-stage university life \u2013 a friend of a friend needed a housemate.\nThey discovered they had done the same course at uni, and were big history buffs, both nerds who liked to talk about ancient geopolitics.\nTheir friendship is something that Cheng brings up in his replies to people like Hanson and Anning \u2013 though of course, as both Cheng and Mohammed have said, they shouldn\u2019t have to. The two spoke to Guardian Australia about their friendship and the rise in public racism they witnessed in 2018.\nIn 2015, when Curtis was murdered, Mohammed took the week off work and helped the Cheng family around the house. Together with Alpha and his closest friends, they sat and wrote the eulogy.\nHe does not see it as a grand gesture. \u201cYou do as friends do,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cThe time that Alpha went through, the worst days of his life, you offer any support that you can. That is just what you do.\u201d\nThey had previously discussed, in an abstract way, Muslim extremism, but it was not a debate that changed after the Parramatta shooting.\n\u201cI remember having geopolitical, historical discussions around the roots of the Islam and west conflict, stemming from the crusades,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cElements of history like the golden ages of Islam and how that changed in terms of its relationship with the west and other minorities. I know Qais has an interest in that. I really enjoyed discussing it.\n\u201cNobody should ever go through what I have needed to go through, but there is a lot more to understand about extremism. That it is definitely not just because of religion. And I think that sometimes in the rhetoric of things, people don\u2019t want to hear about complexity. They don\u2019t want to hear that there are lots of layers to it.\u201d\nFor both men, it was hard to see Anning trash that kind of nuance in parliament in August. The former One Nation senator used his maiden speech to call for a halt on Muslim immigration, an explicit return to the \u201cpredominantly European immigration policy of the pre-Whitlam consensus\u201d (the White Australia Policy), and used the phrase \u201cfinal solution to the immigration issue\u201d, with its loaded Nazi connotations.\n\u201cEvery time I read that, it hits me personally,\u201d Mohammed says. \u201cIt is that sense of \u2018I\u2019m no longer welcome.\u2019 When you see a speech like that, you walk down the street and people know that you\u2019re Muslim, you sort of think, well, do they look at me differently now? Australia is everything I have known and been raised in \u2026 Well what else do you have?\u201d\nFor Cheng, Anning\u2019s speech was the spur to act. To the outside observer, the contrast was stark. Anning, the wannabe demagogue, had cited Isis and terrorism in his call for division. Cheng, who had suffered the reality of extremism, called for tolerance \u2013 a man who seemed to now spend his life constantly turning the other cheek.\nBut it is not true that Cheng does not hate.\n\u201cPeople always go, why are you not angry? Why are you not, you know, spouting hate? The thing is, for me, that is very private. And what people don\u2019t seem to know or realise is that it is incredibly challenging. It does hurt from time to time.\u201d\nWhen Farhad Jabar murdered Cheng\u2019s father, the CCTV caught him strutting on the street outside Parramatta police headquarters. An 18-year-old had given him the gun. He told a court that he did not feel sorry.\n\u201cWe are in the middle of four court cases with people that are accused and being sentenced for their crimes and involvement,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cAnd I find it incredibly difficult to be in the same courtroom. I can\u2019t look them in the face or in the eye.\n\u201cPeople say \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve forgiven them for what has happened.\u2019 And I say, \u2018No \u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than that.\u2019 To say I don\u2019t have any negative emotions is quite false.\u201d\nIn November, another plotter, Milad Atai, took back an apology he had made to the family. He declared remorse to be \u201cbullshit\u201d, shortly before he was sentenced to 38 years in jail.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to speak and write in a way that has a responsibility,\u201d Cheng says. \u201cTo separate out some of the personal grief and trauma. It would have been easy, but I guess I didn\u2019t take the easy way out.\u201d\nThe two men don\u2019t spell it out but they have realised they took more care with their words when they wrote Curtis\u2019s eulogy than elected officials do on the floor of parliament.\n\u201cIn the very early stage, within a week or two of when Dad died, Qais and other friends of mine were just sitting in a room, writing,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cKnowing that words that I have to say, matter.\n\u201cA lot of people say \u2018I can\u2019t do what you do.\u2019 That\u2019s where I get that sense that it would be so easy, because it seems like everyone says that\u2019s what they would do.\u201d\nMohammed now lives with his wife in London, and works in finance. Cheng, a teacher, lives in Canberra. He travels back to Sydney sometimes to have meetings and speak at community events. He also occasionally writes opinion pieces, after thinking about what to say because, if people are going to be listening, it matters to him that he gets it right.",

        "content": "House tests new power by passing bills to end the government shutdown, but legislation is unlikely to break impasse\nDemocrats reclaimed power in the House on Thursday and officially elected Nancy Pelosi to be the next speaker, returning her to a position for which she made history as the first woman elected to the office.\nThe California Democrat earned 220 votes from a total of 430 members present. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, won 192.\nPelosi overcame a Democratic rebellion from members calling for generational change at the top, among other hurdles, to win the gavel but on Thursday the opposition was nominal. In total, she suffered 15 Democratic defections, mostly from new members who pledged to oppose her during their campaigns and from old foes who have long called for new leadership.\nWhen the tally was announced, Democrats erupted in applause. Several members embraced Pelosi as her grandchildren, who were seated on the chamber floor, bounced up and down with excitement. In reclaiming the gavel, Pelosi, who had previously served as speaker between 2007 and 2011, became the first former speaker to win re-election since Sam Rayburn in 1955.\nShe then swore into office the 116th Congress, which includes a record 102 women. The incoming freshman class is the youngest and most racially diverse in history, with a number of outspoken members prepared to take on Donald Trump.\n\u201cOur nation is at a historic moment,\u201d Pelosi said in her remarks on the House floor. \u201cTwo months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.\u201d\nIn their first act after officially taking control, Democrats tested their power in a newly divided Washington by passing legislation to end a partial government shutdown about to enter its 14th day.\nThe two-part package, passed just before 10pm, includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels until 8 February, providing $1.3bn for border security measures but ignoring Trump\u2019s demand for $5.6bn to build 200 miles of fencing along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico.\nThe second part funds the other federal agencies that are now unfunded, including the agriculture, interior, transportation, commerce and justice departments, until 30 September, the end of the current fiscal year.\nThough the legislation is unlikely to break the impasse over the shutdown \u2013 Trump formally pledged to veto it in an official White House statement on Thursday \u2013 it sets the tone for what is expected to be a tumultuous final two years of the president\u2019s first term.\nEarlier in the day special guests had gathered to watch Pelosi elected, including the singer Tony Bennett, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart and fashion consultant Tim Gunn. Pelosi\u2019s supporters wore pins that said \u201cMadame Speaker\u201d.\nTo secure her ascent, Pelosi defused an attempt to block her nomination with a series of concessions to opponents, including pledging to support term limits for serving as speaker. In doing so, she won over key dissenters such as Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged her in 2016.\nThe opposition to Pelosi manifested itself in different ways. Three Democrats voted present (including the newly elected Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who first attempted to vote no, which was not an option).\nOthers backed a variety of candidates. There were three votes for the incoming Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chair, Cheri Bustos of Illinois, two for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and other votes cast for politicians such as the former vice-president Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams, the losing Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia.\nBut for the most part, she received enthusiastic endorsements from the Democrats. Several congresswomen dedicated their vote for Pelosi to the young women who will come after them. Congresswoman Lucy McBath said she would vote for Pelosi in honor of her son Jordan, who was shot dead in Florida. A new member from Texas, Veronica Escobar, enthusiastically voted for \u201cNancy \u2018No Wall\u2019 Pelosi\u201d while others cheered for \u201cNDP\u201d \u2013 the initials for Nancy D\u2019Alesandro Pelosi.\nOne Democratic aide hailed Pelosi as a \u201cmastermind\u201d for her comfortable win and said: \u201cAll of us are amazed by how easy today\u2019s vote will be for her.\u201d\nThe aide noted, however, that unlike Pelosi\u2019s first stint as speaker, \u201cmanaging this caucus will be more difficult than back in 2007\u201d.\nThe 2019-20 Congress began work on Thursday with roughly a quarter of the federal government closed, affecting 800,000 employees, in a shutdown triggered by Trump\u2019s demand last month for the money for a wall along the US-Mexican border \u2013 opposed by Democrats \u2013 as part of any legislation to fund government agencies.\nTrump started Thursday by blaming Democrats for the impasse, calling their opposition to a wall \u201cstrictly politics\u201d.\nHe wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can\u2019t win based on all of the achievements of \u2018Trump,\u2019 so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security \u2013 and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!\u201d\nTrump had previously said he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shut down the government to secure funding to build a physical barrier along America\u2019s southern border.\nDuring a contentious meeting with top congressional leaders in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday, Trump said the shutdown could last \u201ca long time\u201d and promised to reject any offer that did not include billions in taxpayer dollars for a wall, despite the fact that he has repeatedly stated Mexico would be forced to pay for it.\nAt a press conference on Thursday, Pelosi implored Trump to take \u201cyes for an answer\u201d, noting that the bills had previously drawn overwhelming support from Senate Republicans. However, she insisted \u201cwe\u2019re not doing a wall\u201d and described Trump\u2019s signature proposal as \u201can immorality\u201d.\nThe House bills will now go to the Senate, which remains under Republican control. They need 60 votes to advance. Last month, the Senate easily passed legislation that would have funded the government through 8 February without money for Trump\u2019s border wall.\nHowever, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has pledged not to put the legislation on the floor, describing it as \u201cpolitical theatre, not productive policymaking\u201d.\n\ufeffThe Associated Press contributed to this story",

        "content": "Deputy Labor leader says Liberals cannot use \u2018merit\u2019 argument, considering some of its \u2018unimpressive blokes\u2019\nThe Liberal party cannot fall back on the argument it preselects candidates on merit, given \u201csome of the blokes\u201d it counts among its parliamentary ranks, Tanya Plibersek has said.\nResponding to frontbencher Sussan Ley\u2019s push for the Liberal party to work towards a \u201csensible number\u201d to improve its female representation and break ranks from the majority who remained opposed to quotas, Plibersek said it was beyond time this happened.\nThe Liberal senator Jane Hume and the foreign minister, Marise Payne, responded by suggesting the party should do more for women but \u2013 again \u2013 stopped short of endorsing quotas.\nLey told the Australian on Friday she believed \u201ca sensible number and date\u201d to increase the number of Liberal women needed to be implemented \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, to ensure the tide would be turned.\nJason Falinksi became one of the first Liberal party male MPs to also publicly call for more diversity. So far, just 21 female candidates have been preselected by the Liberal party to run in the next election.\nAfter Sarah Henderson and Linda Reynolds began the week attempting to defend the Liberals\u2019 record on female representation \u2013 both within the party and as a government \u2013 as having done more than Labor, Plibersek led Labor\u2019s counter-charge.\n She said she found it \u201claughable\u201d that members of the government, where just 12 of its 74 lower house seats were held by women, were making those claims. The lack of change was \u201cdisappointing\u201d, she said, adding that there was no proof the \u201cmerit\u201d argument stood up, in light of some of the men who found themselves holding a seat.\n\u201cA parliament that is more representative of the Australian community makes better decisions for the whole Australian community,\u201d Plibersek said on Friday.\n\u201cIt is good that some Liberals are waking up to that fact. It would be terrific if the prime minister woke up to that fact.\n\u201c\u2026I think you only have to look at some of the Liberal blokes who have been elected to parliament to see that the merit principle plainly doesn\u2019t apply to Liberal party preselection. There are some pretty unimpressive characters there and if they are there on merit, I will eat my hat.\u201d\nOn Friday Hume told the Australian that quotas are \u201cnot the answer\u201d because they are a \u201cLabor solution\u201d and her party should look for an unspecified \u201cLiberal alternative\u201d.\n\u201cWe need the parliamentary and organisational leadership, state and federal, to come together and start working on this,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cIt cannot wait. It does not have to be a binary between quotas and nothing.\u201d\nAt a press conference in Sydney, Payne said that \u201call options should be on the table\u201d to boost female representation but declined to state a personal position on quotas.\nAsked about low numbers of women in the party, Payne responded \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a science\u201d and suggested the party could \u201cwork collaboratively\u201d to boost women.\nLabor began instituting quotas in 1994, when it adopted the affirmative action policy, which targeted 35% of winnable electorates being preselected with female candidates by 2002, a process that began in the 1970s, when the party\u2019s lack of female representation was highlighted. A formal quota of 40:40:20 was adopted in 2012, to ensure that 40% of the positions were held by women. Labor has since worked towards a quota of 50%.\nBut with that shift came allegations of \u201cquota girls\u201d, a term still bandied about by critics within the Coalition of a quota system. During the past week, Labor has been accused of using gender as a weapon for political gain, a claim Plibersek has rejected.\n\u201cI think it is incredible that anytime we speak about a parliament that looks more like the Australian community, we are accused of weaponising the gender issue or playing the gender card, and all these disparaging comments are made,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think greater gender equality is obviously good for the women, but it is also good for men.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got people in the Liberal party who are trying to shut down the debate, because they feel it is a debate that reflects badly on the women in the party itself.\n\u201cThis is not something that the Labor party has achieved overnight \u2026 it has taken decades to do this, it has taken a determined effort and it has taken a discussion within our own party.\u201d\nPlibersek said that if those who defended the Liberals\u2019 record were correct, they needed to explain how so few women ended up in the party room, and on its frontbench.\n\u201cIt cannot be that the Liberal party is lacking in female talent,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI have seen many talented, articulate Liberal women; somehow they don\u2019t get preselected.\n\u201cIt obviously, is a cultural thing within the party. And it is disappointing you have women in the Liberal party who aren\u2019t prepared to call it out. But what is more disappointing, frankly, is you have a prime minister who turns a blind eye to it.\u201d\nOn current polls, the Liberal party could potentially be left with just six women in the lower house after the election.",

The best find is a charming little money spider called the common dwarf-spine-leg (Maso sundevalli). Although it is widespread, we know almost nothing about this compact, 1.5mm predator, not even why it has such spiny forelegs.\nOrchard Park is the diminutive rump of the Warmington Mill orchard that disappeared under the A605 bypass during the road-happy days of 1996. It is cherished by the villagers; there is a new bench, hazel planted along the edge, and piles of brush and leaf litter for the hedgehogs. The orchard is populated with a diverse mix of fruit trees, including many apples, some with a local history: Barnack Beauty, Ellison\u2019s Orange, Lord Burghley, Bess Pool and Allington Pippin \u2013 single trees of each. Most of them are winter-naked, but some still bear fruit.\nThe arched and twisted Allington Pippin dangles clusters of small red apples, while an unidentified tree carries a scattering of dainty red-streaked yellow apples the size of table tennis balls. I wonder why they look so Christmassy, and realise that they resemble the gold and red baubles on my Christmas tree. The first tree decorations were indeed apples, part of the solstice feast, which evolved into gilded and wrapped fruit, before being supplanted by glass balls.\nThe apples taste wonderful, except the very tart green cooker at the far end. Some of the red ones manage to be firm and crisp to the bite but with soft melt-in-the-mouth white flesh and a sweet apple flavour. But my favourite is the little unknown apple, full of character, crunchy with a resinous hit of acetone, accompanied by woody notes.",

The fall follows a 9% decline the previous year, and has potential consequences for Britain\u2019s research capacity.\nDr Hollie Chandler, a senior policy analyst at the 24-strong group of leading universities, described the decline as \u201ctroubling\u201d and said that were the UK to leave the EU without a deal, it would only increase uncertainty among prospective students from the rest of Europe.\nOverall, the number of EU students who enrolled for the 2018-19 academic year at Russell Group universities fell by 3%. Last year, there was a 1% increase in overall EU student numbers, after years of healthy growth in recruitment.\nAlthough enrolment of EU27 citizens at undergraduate level grew by 1% this year, at taught postgraduate level it fell by 5%.\nThe figures come as an open letter from leaders of 150 universities to MPs said the impact of a no-deal Brexit could lead to \u201can academic, cultural and scientific setback from which it would take decades to recover\u201d.\n\u201cUniversity leaders are united in the view that the UK leaving the EU without a deal is one of the biggest threats our universities have ever faced,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs a sector which contributes over \u00a321bn to UK GDP every year and supports 944,000 jobs, it is critical to the national interest, to the economy, communities and wider society, that the UK\u2019s universities thrive post-Brexit.\n\u201cTo do so, our government must demonstrate the required ambition, put the right measures and guarantees in place, and, crucially, avoid the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.\u201d\nUniversity leaders are particularly anxious to secure a guarantee from ministers that research funding for which the UK may become ineligible after Brexit will be replaced. Funding from the European Research Council (ERC) and Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions programme (MSCA) will be worth an estimated \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31.2bn) to the UK over the next two years, investing in projects to fight cancer and combat climate change.\nDame Janet Beer, the president of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said time was running out.\n\u201cWhile we welcome the assurances that the government has already provided about the continuation of Horizon 2020 funding in a no deal scenario, it is critical that similar guarantees are extended, without delay, to cover ERC and MSCA funding,\u201d said Beer, who is vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool.\n\u201cWithout cast-iron assurances, world-leading academics and researchers may leave for countries where access to ERC funding is not at risk, and those currently considering relocating to the UK may think again.\u201d\nDame Nancy Rothwell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester, said vital research projects at her university risked being disrupted, including work on proton-beam therapy for cancer patients and Nobel-prize winning work on graphene.\n\u201cResearchers who have already spent months or even years preparing funding bids would be left high and dry, including those whose application would be stuck in the middle of the evaluation process,\u201d she said.\nCommenting on the EU student enrolment figures, Chandler said that although the Russell Group universities remained popular study destinations with strong global appeal, the figures cannot be ignored.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to assume that uncertainty over Brexit and the UK\u2019s future relationship with Europe could be a significant factor. The drop in postgraduate research courses is especially troubling \u2013 these students contribute directly to the UK\u2019s research capacity,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf we leave the EU without a deal, the uncertainty felt by prospective European students will only get worse.\u201d\nA UK Government spokesperson said: \u201cScience recognises no borders and the UK has a proud record of welcoming the world\u2019s leading scientists and researchers to work and study here. This will not change when we leave the EU.\n\u201cThrough our modern Industrial Strategy we are investing the highest ever level in research and development in UK history and we are committed to seeking an ambitious future relationship on science and innovation with our EU partners. We are also guaranteeing, in the event of a no deal, money for EU programme-funded research and innovation projects agreed before the end of 2020.\u201d\nShadow Higher and Further Education Minister Gordon Marsden added: \u201cDespite consistent warnings from Labour and the University sector, the Government has continued to ignore the impending damage, especially the drift to no deal, Brexit could cause to our world class Universities and FE Colleges.\n\u201cToday\u2019s letter from the sector reiterated everything we have been saying over the past two years about the threats facing students, staff and research but DfE and the Education Secretary has been abysmally negligent in ensuring those concerns and a deal on them should be put at the top of the negotiations table.\u201d",

        "content": "Why we can\u2019t get enough when we already eat too much\nAre you getting enough protein? The question provides its own answer: if you are worrying about the amount of protein in your diet, then you are almost certainly eating more than enough. This is the paradox of our new protein obsession. For many people, protein has become a kind of secular unction: it instantly anoints any food with an aura of health and goodness. On the menu at the gym where I go, a salad ni\u00e7oise is now repackaged as \u201chigh-protein tuna\u201d. It comes without the usual capers or olives \u2013 those are items that merely add flavour, and who needs that?\nOn Pinterest, the lifestyle-sharing site, you can now choose \u201cprotein\u201d as one of your interests in life, along with \u201ccute animals\u201d and \u201cinspirational quotes\u201d. In 2017, there were 64m Google searches for \u201cprotein\u201d. Anxiety about protein is one of the things that drives a person to drink a flask of vitamin-padded beige slurry and call it lunch.\nYou merely need to visit a western supermarket today to see that many people regard protein as some kind of universal elixir \u2013 one food companies are profitably adding to anything they can. \u201cWhen the Box Says \u2018Protein\u2019, Shoppers Say \u2018I\u2019ll take it\u2019\u201d was the headline of a 2013 article in the Wall Street Journal. In addition to the ubiquitous protein balls, protein bars and protein shakes, you can now buy protein noodles, protein bagels, protein cookies and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 protein coffee. Even foods that are naturally high in protein such as cheese and yoghurt are sold in protein-boosted versions. Strangest of all might be \u201cprotein water\u201d \u2013 clear, fruit-flavoured drinks laced with whey protein, as if ordinary water was insufficiently healthy.\nAround half of all UK consumers are apparently seeking to add \u201cextra protein\u201d to their diets, according to market research from the cereal brand Weetabix \u2013 which has also cashed in on our hunger for protein. The protein version of Weetabix \u2013 a 24-pack of which costs 50p more than the same-sized pack of original Weetabix \u2013 is worth \u00a37m in sales per year.\nIn a way, there\u2019s nothing strange in the fact that we see protein as valuable, because it is. Along with fat and carbohydrate, it is one of the three basic macronutrients, and arguably the most important. We could survive without carbohydrates, but fat and protein are essential. Protein is the only macronutrient to contain nitrogen, without which we cannot grow or reproduce. There are nine amino-acid proteins \u2013 the building blocks of human tissue \u2013 that we can only get from food. Without them, we could grow neither healthy hair and nails nor strong bones and muscle, and our immune system would be impaired. A child who lacks vital protein in the first five years of life will suffer from stunting and sometimes wasting, too, as the dreadful persistence of malnutrition in the developing world reminds us.\nSo the puzzle is not that we should crave protein, but that our protein anxiety has become so acute at a time when the average person in developed countries has a surfeit of protein in their diet \u2013 at least according to official guidelines, which recommend a minimum of 0.8g of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. According to 2015 data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the average person in the US and Canada gets a full 90g a day, a fifth more than the recommended amount (based on a normal North American adult weight of about 80kg). The average European is not far behind with 85g of protein a day, and the average Chinese person consumes 75g.\nWhen we seek out extra protein to sprinkle over our diets, most of us in rich countries are fixating on \u201ca problem that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, said David L Katz, an American doctor and public health scholar who is the director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. In his latest book, The Truth About Food, Katz notes that while the \u201cmythology of protein tends to propagate the notion that more is better\u201d, there are serious concerns that a very high protein intake over a lifetime can result in harm to the liver, kidneys and skeleton.\nThe current protein mania has partly come about because so many people now regard carbohydrates or fats (and sometimes both) with suspicion. In the current nutrition wars, protein has emerged as the last macronutrient left standing. But the whole \u201cmacronutrient fixation\u201d is a \u201cboondoggle\u201d that has been calamitous for public health, Katz told me. \u201cFirst they told us to cut fat. But instead of wholegrains and lentils, we ate low-fat junk food.\u201d Then food marketers heard the message about cutting carbs and sold us protein-enriched junk foods instead. \u201cWhen we talk about protein,\u201d said Katz, \u201cwe are dissociating the nutrient from its food source.\u201d\nAnd yet still we try to get more protein. In this world of abundance, humans seem to be on an eternal quest for the one safe substance that we can consume in limitless quantities without gaining weight. Such is the appeal of Diet Coke.\nOur protein anxiety drives us to take diets already high in meats, soya, sugars and ultra-processed foods and dose them with yet more meats, soya, sugary bars and ultra-processed foods because they are marketed to us as \u201cprotein\u201d \u2013 even though many of these products are not even particularly high in protein.\nThere is something paradoxical about our collective protein worship. When we pay good money for protein-enhanced food, we hope it will lead us to better health (however that is defined). Yet our single-minded pursuit of protein \u2013 as a disembodied nutrient whose presence trumps all other considerations \u2013 can lead us to behave as if we have forgotten everything we knew about food.\nThe intensity of our protein obsession can only be understood as part of a wider series of diet battles that go back half a century. If we now thirst for protein as if it were water, it may be because the other two macronutrients \u2013 fats and carbohydrates \u2013 have each in turn been made to seem toxic in the public mind.\nOfficial dietary guidelines in the US and UK still insist that a healthy diet is one founded on plenty of carbohydrates with limited quantities of fat, especially saturated fat. The rationale for this low-fat advice goes back to the landmark Seven Countries Study, conducted in the 1950s by the American physiologist Ancel Keys. Based on his observation of healthy, olive oil-eating Mediterranean populations, Keys argued that affluent westerners would suffer fewer cases of heart disease if they could limit consumption of saturated fats such as those found in butter, lard and meat.\nBut as interpreted in the modern supermarket, the low-fat diet often ended up being a high-sugar and high-refined-carbohydrate diet, which was not quite what nutritionists had originally envisaged. In recent years, the low-fat, high-carb orthodoxy has come under fierce attack. In 2015, a meta-analysis conducted by a team of Canadian researchers concluded that intake of saturated fat was not associated with raised risk of stroke, type 2 diabetes or death from heart disease. Vocal anti-sugar campaigners such as Gary Taubes \u2013 author of The Case Against Sugar \u2013 have argued that the true cause of our current epidemic of diet-related ill health is not in fact saturated fat, but refined carbohydrate.\nWhile the low-fattists and the low-carbists continue to slug it out, protein comes out the winner as the one safe thing that most of the population feel they can still put their faith in, whether for weight loss or general health. We have to eat something, after all.\nThe current protein fetish is merely the latest manifestation of a far larger phenomenon that Michael Pollan memorably referred to as \u201cnutritionism\u201d around 10 years ago. For decades now, there has been a tendency to think about what we eat and drink in terms of nutrients, rather than real whole ingredients in all their complexity. A combination of diet fads and clever marketing has got us here. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we fixate on \u201clow fat\u201d or \u201clow carbs\u201d or \u201chigh protein\u201d \u2013 we are making the same old mistakes about nutrition in a new form.\nFor a while, on my kitchen counter, next to the jars of rice and flour, there was another canister made of black plastic, much larger than the others. Its label said \u201cSOURCE OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEINS\u201d in huge letters. In much smaller lettering it said \u201cREADY TO MIX PROTEIN POWDER WITH SWEETENERS\u201d and listed three kinds of whey protein: whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and hydrolysed whey protein. When you opened it, a fake vanilla smell wafted into the air and you saw a whitish powder and a black plastic scoop.\nThis soulless canister of ultra-processed whey protein was something that I, as a food writer, never thought I would see in my kitchen. The macho aesthetic of the packaging made my heart sink. I am also no fan of artificial sweeteners, which I believe do no favours either to the palate or to gut bacteria. What\u2019s more, I believe most people should be able to get the nutrients we need from a balanced diet, rather than through supplements.\nBut nothing forces you to bend your own principles like parenthood. I turned to whey protein in a state of mild desperation for my very tall youngest son, who plays competitive sport five or six days a week. Three square meals plus multiple snacks only scratched the surface of his appetite, and he was sometimes almost crying with hunger by dinnertime. My conversations with other sport parents suggest that it\u2019s not uncommon to be at least a little bit obsessed with their child\u2019s protein intake. We grumble that protein bars are a pointless rip-off \u2013 and then we buy another pack of them.\nProtein means different things to different people. To some, it symbolises \u201cweight loss\u201d, while to others it means \u201cmuscles\u201d. To me it appeared as a magical filling substance that just might help my son to be less ravenous.\nI had read studies suggesting protein was the most filling \u2013 or satiating \u2013 of the three macronutrients, and wondered if more protein at breakfast could be the answer. I tried him on homemade waffles enriched with almonds and hidden eggs (at that point he wouldn\u2019t countenance whole eggs) and the improvement in his energy levels was dramatic. It was a short step to making him occasional smoothies from half a scoop of whey protein with milk and bananas or frozen berries. Despite my unease at the powder, I could genuinely see the difference in his levels of fullness. When the canister was empty I didn\u2019t replace it, but I still monitor my son\u2019s protein intake.\nHaving \u201cenough\u201d protein in your diet to meet your basic needs is not necessarily the same as having the right amount for optimum health. When I asked David Katz how much protein a person should consume, he said certain people may indeed require more than the minimum recommendation of 0.8g per kilo of bodyweight \u2013 including athletes like my son. The problem is that once we start thinking more protein is automatically better, it can be hard to know when to stop. The idea that protein is synonymous with healthy eating leads many people to eat in disordered ways that are far from healthy, either for body or mind.\nA couple of years ago, Sarah Shephard, a thirtysomething British sports journalist, realised she was obsessed with protein. On a typical day, she was eating three or four protein bars, hard-boiled eggs, meat, fish and non-starchy vegetables and a couple of protein shakes. Virtually the only carbs in her diet came from the protein bars and shakes. It reached the point where she had so little energy in the evenings because of the lack of calories in her body that she stopped going out.\nShephard\u2019s protein obsession started when injury forced her to give up running. After she started doing boxing and circuits with a new trainer, he told her she should be eating more protein to help prevent future injuries. To start with, Shephard\u2019s new low-carb, high-protein regime felt wonderful. She lost weight, gained muscle and became one of the many people at the gym clutching their sleek flask of protein shake like an amulet.\nHowever, she noticed her thoughts about protein were becoming obsessive. Given the choice between an apple and a protein bar, she always chose the protein bar, even though at a rational level she knew that a piece of fresh fruit with its fibre and vitamins had a lot to recommend it over a processed snack. By the time she finally sought help from a sports nutritionist, he said he had never seen anyone with such an intensive fitness regime who ate so little carbohydrate. She was consuming 150g of protein a day, around 2.5g per kilo of bodyweight \u2013 far in excess of the upper limit recommended for bodybuilders by the US Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\nShephard slowly weaned herself back on to a more balanced diet that included a range of complex carbohydrates such as oats and brown rice. Despite her apprehension, she did not gain weight. When I spoke to her, Shephard had been eating a balanced diet for more than two years without any ill effects, and was a bit mystified as to how she had drifted into her protein fixation.\nEncouraged by the marketers of high-protein foods, many people talk about whether we we have reached our daily target for \u201cmacros\u201d, but we do not talk so much about how much is too much. Adding extra protein beyond our needs can be harmful for people with underlying kidney or liver problems, as the body can struggle to process the excess.\nIn 2017 there were sensationalist headlines around the world when Meegan Hefford, a 25-year-old Australian bodybuilder, died after consuming high amounts of protein shakes and supplements. Hefford hadn\u2019t realised she was suffering from a condition called urea cycle disorder, which meant that her body couldn\u2019t metabolise protein normally. Defenders of high-protein diets immediately attacked the coverage of the story, pointing out that Hefford\u2019s condition was rare and that her death was not caused by protein per se. This was true, but it is also true that there is a significant minority of the population for whom a high-protein diet is not advisable. For the 4.3% or more adults in the UK who have chronic kidney disease, a large amount of protein from red meat can damage renal function.\nAbove and beyond its long-term effects on the body, a fixation with protein can become a form of eating disorder. Three years ago, the American psychologist Richard Achiro decided to study men in Los Angeles engaging in excessive use of protein powders as well as other supplements such as caffeine. Achiro conducted a survey of nearly 200 active men who were using workout supplements and found that, for many of them, protein use had become a \u201cvariant of disordered eating\u201d that threatened their health.\nThese men felt under intense pressure to achieve bodies that were not just thin, but that exhibited a supposedly ideal ratio of fat to muscle. Three per cent of the sample group had been hospitalised as a result of excessive supplement use, yet they still viewed supplements as healthy. Eating disorders have complex causes: Achiro told me the men who were overusing protein supplements also tended to be suffering from body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem and a sense of insecurity about their own masculinity.\nBut they were not helped by the fact that the culture they lived in told them that when they replaced most of their meals with protein shakes, what they were doing was normal. Achiro found that it was hard for these men to recognise that their relationship with protein might have become a problem, \u201cbecause those of us living in western society have been groomed to view a protein-rich diet as the apex of healthful eating\u201d.\nBy 2001, Arla Foods, a vast European dairy cooperative with Danish headquarters, had used up all of the whey in Denmark. The company realised it would have to look further afield to meet the insatiable demand for whey protein. Arla signed a contract with SanCor, an Argentinian dairy company, to build a giant whey protein plant in the town of Porte\u00f1a, to the north of Buenos Aires. When you order \u201cwarm protein pancakes\u201d with blueberries at the gym, the odds are the protein will have come from a plant such as this.\nIt was David Jenkins, a Scottish track and field athlete and silver medallist at the Munich Olympics, who first had the idea of marketing whey protein as a \u201crecovery optimiser\u201d for athletes called ProOptibol. It was launched in health food stores in Southern California and Hawaii in early 1988. At first it was a niche product that found popularity among cyclists and triathletes. The formula for this original whey protein was called WPC 75. It was a byproduct from the Golden Cheese company, based in Corona, California \u2013 a giant factory that produced Monterey Jack and other American cheeses.\nIn just a few decades, whey protein has gone from waste product to aspirational lifestyle enhancer. Whey is the watery stuff left over during cheese-making after the curds are separated off. On traditional dairy farms, it was put to good use in anything from bread-making to pickles, but in the vast American cheese factories of the postwar years it came to be seen as an unwanted nuisance. In US dairy states such as Wisconsin, cheese factories dumped thousands of litres of whey in nearby rivers. It was only in the 1970s, after local authorities placed limits on the dumping of dairy waste, that cheese manufacturers realised they had to find a way to use up this annoying whey. The quality of whey powders \u2013 known as \u201cpopcorn whey\u201d \u2013 was poor, and it was mostly used to feed pigs. The key technology that made whey protein possible was the development of ultrafiltration techniques to pre-concentrate the whey before it was dried. This was when whey protein started to be made on an industrial scale.\nThere is nothing on the average tub of whey protein to suggest it ever came from cheese, let alone from a cow. Whey manufacturers work on the assumption that consumers want it to be as close as possible to flavourless, to preserve the illusion that it is some kind of magic potion for humans. In its unadorned form, however, whey varies considerably in flavour. There are two kinds of whey: sweet whey made from rennet cheeses such as cheddar and mozzarella, and acid whey made from the likes of cottage cheese. Cheddar whey has a tendency to taste cardboardy, mozzarella whey is milky and whey from cottage cheese can be sour or reminiscent of cabbage broth. But in the finished product, all these flavours are evened out and disguised by the cloying scent of chocolate, artificial vanillin or salted caramel.\nDairy whey protein has become a commodity that travels the world in 100kg sacks, generating vast profits, coordinated by GVCs (global value chains). Thanks to the shifting patterns of supply and demand, the protein shake a gymgoer in Tokyo drinks after lifting weights may have originated on a farm in Norway. The lowest-quality whey powder is called \u201cpermeate\u201d and is mostly shipped to Asia, where it is made into infant formula. The higher-quality whey, called WPC 80 because it has an 80% protein content, travels the world to fuel our protein obsession. The global whey protein market is now a complex and hugely competitive global trade, forecast to reach $14.5bn by the year 2023: more than half as much as the global market in breakfast cereal.\nStrolling through London at lunchtime a few weeks ago, I found myself walking down Bread Street, near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, which in medieval times was the site of the city\u2019s bread market. Turning off Bread Street, I came upon a branch of Protein Haus, which claims to sell the \u201cmost amazing protein shakes you will ever taste\u201d. The shakes have names such as Strawberry Warrior and Vegan Coffee Pump and Berry-Yatric, which must be a competitor for the most offensive food name ever. Protein Haus also sells protein foods such as \u201cbliss balls\u201d and indiscriminate steaming portions of various meats.\nFrom Bread Street to Protein Haus \u2013 this sums up how our eating habits have changed in modern times. When I was in Protein Haus staring at the heaps of overcooked chicken, slabs of salmon and rows of whey protein shakes and vegan protein shakes, it suddenly occurred to me how crazy it is that we should treat all of these varied \u201cprotein\u201d substances as if they were in some way identical. A scoop of ultra-processed whey is not, in fact, the same as a grilled salmon fillet, either in nutrition or in the experience of eating it. Salmon \u2013 even the farmed kind \u2013 will be high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, whereas whey protein is low in vitamins and minerals (except for calcium) and fat-free. The only thing these foods have in common is that they tend to be fuel first and pleasure later (if at all).\nAt the same time, our reverence for protein as the one perfect nutrient tends to completely ignore how the protein we eat is produced, or what the environmental consequences of that production might be. Of the 90g of protein eaten each day by the average American, two-thirds is composed of animal products.\nOne irony of Britain\u2019s obsession with protein is that we don\u2019t actually produce very much of it. In fact, only 3% of arable land in Europe is given over to protein crops such as pulses, and Europe imports more than two-thirds of its animal feed. Much of the protein consumed in Europe is meat raised on materials that actually originate in South America or the US as soybean oil or other oilseeds and have to be shipped across the world. So long as we largely consume protein from animal sources, our obsession with protein is also likely to be bad for the planet.\nAt the end of September, at the Aldeburgh food festival in Suffolk, I had a lunch with Nick Saltmarsh, who runs Hodmedod, a company that works with British farmers to produce locally grown pulses. Saltmarsh told me he feels our mania for protein foods has gone so far that we sometimes can\u2019t recognise real protein when it is right in front of us.\nVegetable proteins such as lentils and peas tend to be regarded as \u201clow-quality\u201d compared with meat, eggs and dairy. But Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, has argued that this \u201cquality\u201d argument is misleading. His great discovery was that all plant sources of protein \u2013 from peanuts to edamame beans \u2013 contain all essential amino acids. Admittedly they contain smaller concentrations of the amino acids than meat or eggs, but in the context of a plentiful and varied diet, this doesn\u2019t matter.\nThe problem is partly that beans and lentils do not fit our tunnel-visioned conception of what protein is. Pulses such as lentils contain around 25% protein but also 25% carbohydrate \u2013 which makes them hard to categorise within the dogmatic categories of modern nutrition. Is the lentil a protein (good) or a carb (bad)?\nWhen Saltmarsh takes his product range to food fairs, he finds that bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts will sometimes pick up a packet of pea flour and say \u201cooh! Peas!\u201d \u2013 because pea protein has become fashionable as a vegan alternative to whey. \u201cBut when they see that it also contains carbohydrate, they put it down again,\u201d he said.\nSome now shun any meal or snack that can\u2019t be categorised as a \u201cprotein\u201d fix. But they aren\u2019t among the millions of people for whom a lack of protein is indeed a real and pressing problem \u2013 and who don\u2019t tend to be the ones browsing pea protein at fitness fairs.\nThe word protein derives from the ancient Greek protos, meaning first. When a Dutch scientist called GJ Mulder first brought the term into use, in 1838, he proposed \u2013 rightly, as it turns out \u2013 that protein was a crucial substance in all animal bodies. But new research suggests protein is required not just in an absolute sense, but in a particular ratio to the other nutrients in our diets.\nGoing by official guidelines, as we\u2019ve seen, the average person has access to more than enough protein for general health. It turns out our perplexing protein obsession may actually be a symptom of a larger problem in our sugar-heavy modern diets: if it feels like we are not eating enough protein, it\u2019s because we\u2019re eating too much of everything else.\nIn 2005, two biologists called David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson put forward the \u201cprotein leverage hypothesis\u201d, in which they argued that protein could be the missing link in the obesity crisis. Since the 1960s, the absolute level of protein consumed by the average westerner has not changed. What has changed is the ratio of protein in our diets.\nBecause our overall calorie consumption has risen by 14%, the ratio of protein to carbohydrate and fat has significantly dropped. In 1961, the average American got around 14-15% of calories in the form of protein, whereas today it is 12.5%. This doesn\u2019t sound like a big drop, but Raubenheimer and Simpson\u2019s research suggests that even a small drop in the percentage of protein can have a big impact on eating behaviour \u2013 driving us to overeat.\nLike many other animals, humans have what biologists call a \u201cdominant appetite\u201d for protein. The biological drive for protein is so strong that a cricket who feels short of protein will resort to cannibalism. When a locust is short of protein, it will explore different food sources to redress the balance. Humans are neither as ruthless as crickets nor as prudent as locusts. When given access to a diet that is low on protein and heavy in carbs and fats, humans will binge, in an attempt to extract the protein they need.\nIf many of us overeat, it could be partly because our bodies are desperately seeking out protein in a food environment flooded with refined wheat and oils and many kinds of sugar. As Raubenheimer and Simpson wrote in their startlingly original 2012 book The Nature of Nutrition: \u201cDilution of protein in the diet by fat and carbohydrate drives excess consumption, perhaps more so in some individuals, life stages and populations than others.\u201d In other words, obesity may often really be hunger hiding in plain view.\nThe urgent question raised by this research is how we can get our protein ratios back to a healthy level. Our current protein mania \u2013 encouraged by the food business and the whey protein industry \u2013 suggests that the answer is to supercharge our diets with a flood of added protein. But eating protein to excess comes with its own costs, the main one being that it tends to shorten the lifespan.\nA more effective way to concentrate protein in our diets, Raubenheimer and Simpson say, would be to keep our protein levels constant (assuming we have enough) but cut down on \u201cfat, sugar and other readily digested carbohydrates\u201d, which would allow us to reach the protein our bodies need at a lower level of calories. But given that sugar is poured into everything from bread to stir-fry sauces, this solution would require a radical restructuring of our food environment.\nOur protein needs do not remain constant over the human lifespan: 0.8g per kilogram of bodyweight may be enough for a twentysomething, but not for an octogenarian. If anyone needs extra protein, it is not fit young gymgoers, but old people \u2013 particularly those on low incomes who may struggle to buy or cook meals for themselves. Instead of protein bars for the young and rich, we need omelettes and chickpea soup for the old and poor. From the age of 50 onwards we progressively lose muscle and our protein requirements become higher, just as appetite tends to decline. Rates of protein malnutrition are alarmingly high among elderly people admitted to hospital.\nMost of those who can afford to buy a \u201chigh-protein\u201d tuna plate are already well nourished in amino acids. By contrast, in these austere times, many hard-pressed eaters are forced into a kind of protein hunger by the economic circumstances of their lives. Think of the families who go to the chip shop and buy chips with no fish, or the person on universal credit living on plain pasta until the next cheque comes in. This is one reason there is a huge market for savoury snacks that taste like a ghostly echo of the hearty, protein-based meals of the past while consisting of little but refined carbs and oil: roast chicken flavour crisps, barbecue tortilla chips. Raubenheimer and Simpson\u2019s research suggests that the colossal market for these cheap snacks could be another symptom of a world in which \u2013 despite all those bars and shakes on the shelves \u2013 many are still hungry for protein.\nBehind the current protein hype, there is a kernel of truth. A deficit of protein is indeed part of the hugely complex puzzle of what\u2019s wrong with modern diets. The problem is that the right question \u2013 am I getting enough protein? \u2013 is being asked by the wrong people.\nBee Wilson\u2019s next book, The Way We Eat Now: Strategies for Eating in a World of Change, will be published by Fourth Estate in March.

        "content": "Despite much debate in UK and US there is still little agreement over how safe e-cigarettes are\nSifting through contradictory evidence is common when it comes to choosing the right thing to do to improve our health, not least at new year when many of us promise to leave old habits behind and make a fresh start. One topic that is almost guaranteed to provoke arguments is e-cigarettes. Thousands of research papers have been published about these devices over the past decade. But we do not seem to be much closer to a global consensus on their risks or benefits, and arguably the debate is becoming more entrenched. What is going on?\nA number of factors appear to be fuelling this, but in 2018 one more than any other seemed to be driving the debate. It relates to the consequences of e-cigarette use by young people, and the extent that youth vaping will lead to smoking. In other words: are e-cigarettes creating a new generation of nicotine users, and will these vapers become the smokers of the future?\nScientists and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pondered the evidence on these questions in 2018 and came to different conclusions. In the US, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine reported that \u201cthere is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever using combustible tobacco cigarettes among youth and young adults\u201d. Advice from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says: \u201cE-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products.\u201d\nIn the UK, an updated evidence review from Public Health England concluded: \u201cE-cigarettes are attracting very few young people who have never smoked into regular use, and e-cigarettes do not appear to be undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking in the UK among young people.\u201d In addition, a House of Commons science and technology committee report stated: \u201cConcerns about the risk of e-cigarettes potentially providing a \u2018gateway\u2019 into conventional smoking have not materialised to any significant degree.\u201d\nTrends in vaping may be diverging between the UK and US \u2013 two countries that have traditionally taken a fairly permissive approach to e-cigarettes. Surveys in both countries include questions on experimentation with vaping, such as whether a person has ever tried an e-cigarette. This type of experimentation is more common in the US than the UK. Among teenagers in their final year of secondary school in the US, around age 18, 37% reported having tried an e-cigarette in the past year. Among 18-year-olds in Great Britain, the most recent survey data found 23% had tried vaping. In addition, two large national youth surveys in the US, Monitoring the Future and the National Youth Tobacco Survey, found significant increases in the use of e-cigarettes between 2017 and 2018, a sharp rise not seen in the UK.\nDifferences in how use is measured may play a role. In the US, survey questions focus on whether someone has ever used an e-cigarette or whether they have used one recently (in the past 30 days). Use in the past 30 days is a broad measure that means teenagers who may simply have tried an e-cigarette once or twice in the past month are included in those figures. In the UK, in contrast, there has been a focus on measuring regular use (at least weekly) and on whether young people who have never smoked cigarettes are vaping. UK figures over several recent years have found that regular use of e-cigarettes by teenagers who have never smoked remains very low, at less than 1%.\nDiffering policies may also help explain these differences. In the UK, almost all forms of e-cigarette marketing have been banned since 2016. This is not the case in the US. In addition, newer devices appear to be popular with young Americans. These include Juul, which are small, discreet, easy to use and deliver nicotine more rapidly than older models, and have only recently become available in the UK. The EU also imposes limits on the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes, controls not in place in the US.\nAttitudes to nicotine also differ. The UK has official guidance on tobacco harm reduction that recognises nicotine is not the harmful substance in tobacco (it is the thousands of other chemicals in cigarettes) and nicotine replacement therapy is licensed for use in smokers who are pregnant or children above the age of 12. In the US, the statement that nicotine harms the developing brain (evidence that comes from studies with mice and rats, not humans) is widely used in official documents. This means any e-cigarette use by American youth, even experimentation, is viewed as a cause for concern.\nThis transatlantic debate has wider implications because reports of study findings are played out in the global media, causing confusion in countries that have not yet decided how to regulate e-cigarettes. The reported rise in youth vaping in the US has resulted in a crackdown on the American e-cigarette market, with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requiring Juul and other similar products to be removed from many retail outlets. The FDA has invested in graphic public information campaigns to discourage youth vaping. These campaigns emphasise the risks without mentioning the research that shows e-cigarettes can help smokers quit. One consequence is that only 2.6% of Americans now believe vaping is much less harmful than smoking, despite plenty of research showing that to be the case.\nThis misperception of the risk is seen in the UK as well, albeit not to the same degree. Research published on Friday in the journal Addiction found that even among smokers and ex-smokers in the UK, just over half surveyed (57.3%) correctly believed e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking, while 25% believed them to be equally or more harmful. Many of those surveyed (nearly four in 10) incorrectly believed that nicotine was the cancer-causing compound in cigarettes, and almost nine in 10 overestimated the health risk from nicotine.\nEvidence from the US and UK combined indicates that efforts to deter teenagers from trying vaping may discourage adult smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Fortunately, in both countries smoking rates continue to decline for both adults and young people, a fact often forgotten amid the furore about e-cigarettes. If e-cigarettes were a gateway to tobacco, these trends would stall or be reversed. And in the UK at least, government agencies and leading charities actively support vaping as a positive choice for smokers trying to stop.\nWe should not be forced to choose between protecting children and supporting the one in two adult smokers who will suffer and die prematurely from a smoking-related disease if they continue to smoke. The challenge in 2019 and beyond will be to ensure the right balance is struck.\nProf Linda Bauld is professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, deputy director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, and holds the Cancer Research UK (CRUK)/Bupa chair in behavioural research for cancer prevention at CRUK.\nDr Suzi Gage is a lecturer at the University of Liverpool.

I\u2019m Warren Murray and these are the stories on the agenda today.\nSocial media is fuelling sharply higher rates of depression among girls than boys, a study that interviewed almost 11,000 14-year-olds has found. As many as three-quarters of 14-year-old girls who suffer from depression also have low self-esteem and are unhappy with how they look. Greater daily hours of social media use corresponds to an increase in depressive symptoms, explained Professor Yvonne Kelly from University College London, as well as poor sleep.\nAnne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, warned that even some children as young as nine \u201care becoming almost addicted to \u2018likes\u2019 as a form of social validation that makes them happy\u201d. Shannon McLaughlin, 18, from Blackburn, who was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in her early teens, said: \u201cPeople mostly share the positive things about life on social media, without showing the negatives \u2026 Seeing that everyone was happy and enjoying life made me feel so much worse.\u201d Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, said social media firms should be forced to adopt a duty of care to protect young users.\nSeparately this morning, paediatricians are saying that screen time is not inherently bad for children, but parents do need to focus on making sure their children get enough sleep, exercise and family interaction. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has produced guidance including a checklist for whether your family\u2019s screen time is under control.\nPelosi back in the chair \u2013 Democrats have reclaimed power in the US House of Representatives from the Republicans and elected Nancy Pelosi back to the speaker\u2019s position that she was the first woman in history to hold. Pelosi swore into office the 116th Congress, which includes a record 102 women. \u201cOur nation is at a historic moment,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.\u201d\nIn their first act since taking back control, Democrats last night tested their power by passing legislation to end the near fortnight-long government shutdown. Donald Trump has pledged to veto the bill \u2013 which ignores his demands for billions of dollars for a border wall \u2013 but it sets the tone for what is expected to be a tumultuous final two years of the president\u2019s first term. Republicans still have control of the Senate. Pelosi had to counter Democratic calls for generational change to regain the speaker\u2019s chair. Fifteen of her own party voted against her.\nPolice plan for Brexit hard border \u2013 Almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland will train for deployment in Northern Ireland in case a no-deal Brexit causes disorder along the Irish border, the Guardian has learned. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said the Republic was also making serious preparations and reiterated there could be no EU renegotiation with Britain. University leaders say a no-deal Brexit poses \u201cone of the biggest threats\u201d ever faced by the sector, which contributes over \u00a32bn to UK GDP every year, supports 944,000 jobs, and drives British science and innovation. There was a 9% decrease in the number of EU postgraduate research students enrolling at Russell Group universities this academic year, following a 9% decline the previous year. Overall enrolments have fallen 3%, reversing years of growth. In Brexit politics, more than half of Conservative party members would rather leave the EU with no deal than see Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal adopted, according to a survey. And the Brexit ferry company Seaborne Freight not only doesn\u2019t own so much as a plastic swan pedalo \u2013 it also appears to have copy and pasted terms and conditions on its website from a takeaway pizza service.\nUs and them \u2013 Dubbed \u201cFat Cat Friday\u201d, today the average CEO of a FTSE 100 company has already pocketed the equivalent pay for the whole of 2019 of a typical full-time worker in Britain. The High Pay Centre and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) have found top executives earn 133 times more than the average worker, at a rate of around \u00a31,020 per hour or \u00a33.9m annually. That\u2019s up 11% compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile it has been revealed that Google moved \u20ac19.9bn ($22.7bn) through a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in 2017 to reduce its foreign tax bill.\nAfter all the horror, Assad stays \u2013 Syria\u2019s ruler has essentially won the country\u2019s brutal war and will remain in power with Russian backing, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary has conceded. But in remarks directed at Moscow, Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be involved in Syria then you need to make sure that there really is peace in Syria. And that means making sure that President Assad does not use chemical weapons.\u201d Many Arab states have also accepted that Assad has survived the seven-year civil war and are preparing to reopen embassies in Damascus. The British government has previously been at the forefront of calling for Assad to make way for a new government. Donald Trump recently shocked allies and triggered the resignation of his defence secretary by declaring he would pull all US troops out of Syria.\nClose to the bone \u2013 The Green party MP Caroline Lucas will today call for a tax on meat to help make the farming industry carbon-neutral. \u201cIf the world\u2019s diet doesn\u2019t change, we simply can\u2019t avoid the worst effects of climate change,\u201d Lucas will tell the Oxford Farming Conference. Globally, livestock rearing is estimated to be responsible for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, and the \u201cVeganuary\u201d movement is this month encouraging people to abstain from or abandon meat-eating. But Phil Stocker, chief executive of the NSA, defended British sheep farming as one of the least intensive forms of livestock farming compared with beef, pork and poultry megafarms and feedlots in other parts of the world: \u201cOur unique, grass-based method of sheep production in Britain is hidden within more global and general statistics.\u201d\nAround half of all UK consumers are apparently seeking to add \u201cextra protein\u201d to their diets, writes Bee Wilson: \u201cIn just a few decades, whey protein has gone from waste product to aspirational lifestyle enhancer \u2026 Anxiety about protein is one of the things that drives a person to drink a flask of vitamin-padded beige slurry and call it lunch.\u201d The fixation has been taken to dangerous levels, potentially contributing to eating disorders, and harm to the liver, kidneys and skeleton.\nIn 2005, two biologists named David Raubenheimer and Stephen Simpson produced the \u201cprotein leverage hypothesis\u201d, that this essential nutrient could be the missing link in the obesity crisis. Since the 1960s, the absolute level of protein consumed by the average westerner has not changed. What has changed is the ratio of protein in our diets \u2013 and if many of us overeat, it could be partly because our bodies are desperately seeking out the right ratio of protein \u2013\u00a0a nutrient essential for life \u2013\u00a0in a food environment flooded with refined wheat, oils and sugars. \u201cThe urgent question,\u201d writes Wilson, \u201cis how we can get our protein ratios back to a healthy level.\u201d\nManchester City have reignited the Premier League title race, handing Liverpool their first loss of the season in a pulsating 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium. A two-footed lunge from City captain Vincent Kompany left Liverpool coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp apoplectic post-match, but it was the poise and calm of Sergio Ag\u00fcero that helped City dent their nearest rivals, writes Barney Ronay.\nCheteshwar Pujara continues to frustrate Australia in the fourth Test in Sydney, as India close in on a first-ever series win on the continent.

        "content": "Married off at 13, Maureen lost her education and her health. Her plight is common in a country racked by economic turmoil\nThe end of Maureen\u2019s days at a primary school in north-eastern Zimbabwe marked the beginning of her life as a wife.\nAt 13, the brightest student in her class in Mudzi, Mashonaland, she was married to a man three times her age.\nHer father, a poor farmer, had promised to fund Maureen\u2019s secondary education but, when the time came, he could not raise the money. Marrying off his daughter was a quick fix. Maureen swiftly fell pregnant and was still 13 when she gave birth after spending hours in labour. The baby did not survive.\nThree years on and Maureen is at Chinhoyi provincial hospital. She is among the scores of underage brides being cared for here who are suffering from obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged labour.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven my parents for doing this to me. I had a bright future but now they treat me like an outcast,\u201d says Maureen.\n\u201cWhen my parents told me about the marriage I couldn\u2019t believe it, because they had always given me the impression that I was their most intelligent child and I would pursue my studies. The man was abusive, he called me names and beat me several times, especially after I lost my baby,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dreams were destroyed by that man.\u201d\nChild marriage in Zimbabwe is often driven by poverty. Dowries offer a welcome, if brief, respite from penury in poor households struggling to weather a vicious economic crisis. The brides, though, are more likely to remain in a state of privation due to lack of personal development and education.\nAlthough underage marriage is illegal and local organisations have been fighting against it as an economic transaction, the financial meltdown has worsened the situation. About one in every three girls in Zimbabwe is married before the age of 18, the legal age of consent.\nAccording to campaign organisation Girls Not Brides, families see little worth in girls.\n\u201cIn many communities, economic opportunities are severely limited, especially for girls and women. Families therefore see little value in educating their daughters and instead marry them off to fulfil the role of a wife and mother,\u201d says a Girls Not Brides spokesperson.\nZimbabwe is facing an acute shortage of cash and, as basic commodities disappear from the shelves, families\u2019 disposable income has been depleted.\nRights defenders say child marriage, outlawed by the Zimbabwean constitutional court in 2016, has spiralled in the rural areas that constitute 75% of the country.\nKresi, 16, from Masvingo, is another teenager whose future was jeopardised when she was married off to a cattle farmer in her village. Her family received a dowry of two cows and a few groceries in exchange for Kresi. She also suffers from obstetric fistula, a hole between the genital tract and bladder or rectum caused by lengthy or obstructed labour.\nWomen and girls who experience obstetric fistula suffer constant incontinence, shame, social segregation and further health problems. It is estimated that more than 2 million young women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with the condition untreated.\n\u201cI felt cheap and abused. My mates are in high school doing well for themselves. [My family] had no business selling me off. Now I have this condition which I cannot control. No one has even come to see me in this hospital,\u201d Kresi says, sobbing.\nTendai, 14, of Bindura says her family gave her away in exchange for 100 Zimbabwean dollars (22p).\nShe was married to a man with three wives. As the youngest wife, Tendai is burdened with both child-bearing and work in the fields.\n\u201cI still want to go back to school. I just hope my husband can give me that chance. But as the youngest wife I have to do everything here at home,\u201d Tendai says.\nShe is bitter over her parent\u2019s decision to marry her off.\nWith a drought looming and disposable incomes depleted from galloping inflation, poor families are more likely to exchange their daughter for very little.\n\u201cIn areas like Binga, Matabeleland, the dowry can be a goat, which is an insult to the value of the girl. In some instances families just leave their child at the man\u2019s house to lessen their own burden,\u201d says Grace Maunganidze, a local activist.\nAnother activist, Abigail Mutema, blames child marriages on the stronghold of a patriarchal society.\n\u201cUntil women are emancipated, child marriages will never end. In some of the communities, girls as young as 16 are deemed too old, so they need to get married. There is nothing to do in the rural areas, so the easier route is to get married. Poverty plays a role in these child marriages,\u201d says Mutema.\n\u201cOlder women have become perpetrators of these early child marriages. A woman is not complete without marriage, they say.\u201d",

        "content": "Survey also finds that in two-option poll, 76% would choose no deal over remain\nMore than half of Conservative party members want Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal to be rejected in favour of leaving the EU with no deal, according to a survey.\nThe poll, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), found a majority of the Tory rank and file are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal is better than the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan.\nIn a three-way referendum, with the options of leaving without a deal, staying in the EU or leaving with May\u2019s deal, 57% preferred leaving without a deal. Only 23% of members said they would vote for May\u2019s deal in a three-way referendum.\nThe findings were released on Friday by the ESRC-funded party members project, run from Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University.\nJust 29% of Tory members would vote for May\u2019s deal, compared with 64% who would vote to leave without a deal, if there was a two-option referendum.\nAmong party members, opposition to the deal negotiated by their own leader outweighs support by a margin of 59% to 38%.\nMore members (53%) think May\u2019s deal does not respect the 2016 EU referendum result than the 42% who think it does.\nThe findings are a further blow to May, who hopes to win a majority in parliament for her EU deal, which is expected to be put to the vote later in January. In November, she appealed directly to the public in an attempt to put pressure on rebellious backbenchers to fall in line.\nThe survey result will spur on a minority of MPs who want the UK to leave on World Trade Organization rules.\nIt comes after the EU refused to hold further meetings to discuss May\u2019s Brexit deal, and as the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, warned no deal would become far more likely if MPs rejected the prime minister\u2019s proposals.\nAcademics surveyed 1,215 ordinary Conservative party members, together with a representative sample of 1,675 voters.\nProf Tim Bale, who led the research, said the findings showed No 10 could not depend upon constituency associations to persuade Tory MPs to back May\u2019s deal.\n\u201cThe Tory rank and file, it seems, are convinced that no deal is better than May\u2019s deal,\u201d he said. \u201cTory members\u2019 dislike for the PM\u2019s deal really comes out when we asked about a referendum in which the choice came down to her deal or no deal.\n\u201cOnly 29% of Tory members would vote for Mrs May\u2019s deal, compared to 64% who would vote to leave without a deal.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s as nothing to Conservative party members faced with a referendum offering just two choices \u2013 remain or no deal. Some 76% of Conservative party members would plump for no deal,\u201d he said.\nBale suggested there were two specific issues behind the opposition to May\u2019s deal, the first being the Irish backstop.\n\u201cTory members have become convinced that the Irish backstop is a bad idea,\u201d he said, with 40% believing it was a reason to reject the deal, and 21% thinking it was irrelevant because May\u2019s deal \u201cis a bad one anyway\u201d.\nThe second issue is 76% of members being sceptical about warnings that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption, he said.\n\u201cTory members, like Tory voters, are utterly unconvinced, despite their own government\u2019s best recent efforts, that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption.\n\u201cSome 72% of voters currently intending to support the Conservatives think the warnings are \u2018exaggerated or invented\u2019 \u2013 a figure that rises to 76% among Tory members.\n\u201cMeanwhile, those members are convinced by a margin of 64% to 19% that leaving without a deal would have a positive rather than a negative effect on Britain\u2019s economy in the medium to long term,\u201d he said.\nNearly half (48%) of Conservative members think May is doing fairly badly or very badly as prime minister, and 44% think she should quit if parliament rejects her deal, he said.\n\u201cIn short, Mrs May has failed not only to convince the country, and quite probably parliament, that her Brexit deal is a good one, she has also failed to convince the party faithful,\u201d Bale said.\nThe research showed that a greater proportion of Tory members think the government has made a mess of negotiating Brexit than those who just support the party.\nAmong voters as a whole, 71% feel that the government has made a mess of negotiating Brexit, according to Bale\u2019s analysis. That figure drops to 56% among those currently intending to vote Conservative.\nBut the poll of party members found that 68% of Tory members think the government is doing badly at negotiating the country\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 a proportion that rises to 78% of those party members who voted leave in 2016.",

        "content": "As a hard-boiled detective with a radically altered face, the Oscar-winner\u2019s latest role is getting heralded as a major transformation but it\u2019s far more than stunt casting \nThe marketing for Karyn Kusama\u2019s sun-dried Californian cop thriller Destroyer has leaned heavily on the supposedly drastic change of pace \u2013 and face \u2013 it represents for its very famous leading lady. \u201cNothing Nicole Kidman has done in her career can prepare you for Destroyer,\u201d blares the leading pull-quote on the film\u2019s posters, while variations of \u201ctransformative\u201d appear below, over a straight-on image of Kidman\u2019s admittedly dramatically altered visage: all hellishly mottled, perma-dirtied skin and ravine-deep eyebags, under a mangy, unconditioned bison pelt of a wig. It looks just enough like Kidman\u2019s own to draw in the devoted, but removed from the poster, anyone else might take for a particularly egregious DUI mugshot.\n\u201cSee [X actor] as you\u2019ve never seen them before\u201d is, of course, a time-honoured promotional strategy, particularly when it comes to campaigning for acting awards, where elaborate makeup work or severe weight changes will never count against you. Kidman has been down this road before, to Oscar-winning effect. In 2002, the media attention on her dowdy deglam job as Virginia Woolf in The Hours rather overwhelmed the discussion of her finely wrought, emotionally piercing performance \u2013 jokes about her prosthetic hooter extended all the way to the Oscar presentation itself, as Denzel Washington opened the envelope and rather snidely announced her victory \u201cby a nose\u201d.\nThat was in the flush of Kidman\u2019s post-divorce career rejuvenation: freed from the demeaning celebrity status of being Mrs Tom Cruise, she took a varied, adventurous jumble range of projects to fully spotlight the serious solo acting intent that To Die For, Portrait of a Lady and Eyes Wide Shut had already promised. The Hours wasn\u2019t even the best of them, but it was the one that announced that plan most literally, with literary biopic cred, uglifying makeup and all. She was never going to win an Oscar for truly on-the-edge work like Birth or Dogville \u2013 with characters whose interiority was more unnerving than their appearance \u2013 but Woolfing it up proved the point on Academy-friendly terms.\nSixteen years on, the point no longer needs to be proved. We have since seen Kidman excelling in every register from brittle acid comedy (Margot at the Wedding) to sexed-up southern gothic derangement (The Paperboy) to quiet-storm trauma release (her astonishing, Emmy-winning turn on TV\u2019s Big Little Lies), with enough bizarre missteps and undeserved misfires in between to give her career a jaggedly complicated arc. All of which is to say that pretty much everything Kidman has done in her career has prepared us \u2013 and more importantly, her \u2013 for the role of raggedly bent Los Angeles cop Erin Bell in Kusama\u2019s film, if only because it\u2019s hard these days to think of what a typical Kidman role might be.\nOn the outside, at least. For it\u2019s what emerges from beneath that disorientingly scorched, ruined exterior that feels more familiar to Kidman, as Bell proves another expert study in her gallery of smart women who lie to themselves \u2014 the film\u2019s niftily two-pronged narrative finds her chasing a fortune in the past, leading to a curdled blend of redemption and revenge in the present, kidding herself all the way about how easy or successful the pursuit might be. And she suffers for it, perhaps more physically and viscerally than in any Kidman vehicle since Lars von Trier put her through the wringer in Dogville. The beatings she takes here, filmed by Kusama with the kind of blunt, unfetishised frankness that male action directors rarely direct at female protagonists, are entirely startling.\nGenre films like Destroyer are rarely framed around female characters; when they are, the heroine tends to be portrayed as dully indestructible, her feminine attributes either pushed aside in favour of \u201cone of the boys\u201d toughness or flattened into a one-dimensional form of girl power. In this regard, Destroyer makes an interesting companion piece to Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn\u2019s sharp, angry update of Lynda La Plante\u2019s Widows \u2013 another bleak, hard-boiled genre piece to unusually place a fiftysomething woman at the active centre of its copious action. Erin Bell and Viola Davis\u2019s Veronica Rawlings certainly share enough flawed, disappointment-fuelled determination to power a fiercely driven underworld mission; squint a little, and it\u2019s not too hard to imagine how their narratives might intersect. Both films make the case for women who have been around the block a little as persuasive action heroes.\nKidman\u2019s Bell is resilient, certainly, but her damage is foregrounded to prove it, in her scarred, choked voice (deftly lowered from the flashbacks) and her jarring makeover: that face isn\u2019t a mere attention-grabbing stunt, but the required external manifestation of all the repeated effort and failure she\u2019s expended and endured as a cop, as a lover and, we come to learn, as a mother too. The overriding spirit of Kidman\u2019s performance is one of a distinctly feminine exhaustion, the impact of having to work harder than the dismissive men surrounding her just to keep her head above water \u2013 and not always excelling in the process. However might a 51-year-old woman with three decades\u2019 experience of working in pre-#TimesUp Hollywood channel such feeling? Perhaps Destroyer isn\u2019t such a leap for the star after all.",

In this typically understated nu-metal video, he distinguishes his manly moves by throwing down on a helipad (very dangerous!) and inviting viewers to celebrate the size of his ... steering wheel.\nThe classic novelty single was inspired by distant climes whose locals, one imagines, wouldn\u2019t be seen dead dancing to it. Sure, it ruined your school disco, but consider the plight of singer Dene Michael Betteridge, who was forced to perform the song\u2019s lumpen moves when in jail for benefit fraud. \u201cThese terrifying criminals tell you to do something, you do it,\u201d he said.\nThe only way to get smooth, mullet-sporting Cyrus on traditional country radio was to play up his horndog status. A choreographer taught the distinctive line dance to the female fans who turned up for the video shoot, the label organised a dance contest and the 90s line-dancing fad was born (before dying with Steps\u2019 monstrous 5, 6, 7, 8).\nIf my bandmates ruined my wedding, I wouldn\u2019t be inclined to accompany them to a disco and knock out a rinky-dink dance routine, but such is life in the video for Tragedy. The hands-by-the-ears dance moves could be likened to Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream, if you had lost your mind and critical faculties.\nREM challenged themselves to write this dumb bubblegum song, which swiftly became their second US Top 10 hit. Needing a video to match, the director, Katherine Dieckmann, determined to break down Michael Stipe\u2019s \u201cstaid\u201d public image with this mildly aerobic, entirely charming routine that provoked much playground copycatting. A lark, but a self-aware and not-unkind one.\nUS rap spurs global viral dances, but the UK scene isn\u2019t too shabby at it. Following Skepta\u2019s Rolex Sweep and KIG\u2019s Head, Shoulders, Kneez & Toez, Gun Lean finds Russ performing his glitchy, lean-back bob in Sainsbury\u2019s cereal aisle and moving embattled drill closer to the (snap, crackle and) pop mainstream.\nThe Saturday Night dance didn\u2019t originate with Whigfield, but by the time she performed the No 1 hit on Top of the Pops, the kinetic, bunny-hopping bop had become such a phenomenon that the Dane had no choice but to scowl as some talentless buffoons performed it around her. Its legacy endures in regional aqua aerobics classes.\nPerhaps the only video to feature Princess Diana, Gaddafi and the Statue of Liberty, whose limbs were computer-manipulated into mimicking the ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired the song. On one hand, this two-arm movement couldn\u2019t be easier; on the other, the video reveals dozens of uncoordinated New Yorkers making an enjoyable hash of it.\nWho knew that Psy\u2019s pony-spanking dance could do so much harm? It has led to deaths, rival gang shootouts, near-fatal LSD trips, conspiracy theories, fraudster arrests, Ed Balls\u2019 spirited jockeying and illegal firecracker production. Not to mention all the slipped discs.\nMost of the moves detailed in Crank That are easily replicable \u2013 punching, starting a motorbike, the robot \u2013 hence its breakout success. But one element of the song mercifully didn\u2019t go mainstream: namely the \u201cSuperman\u201d, which Urban Dictionary details as the emission of a certain fluid that then dries into a cape-like layer. Grisly.\nThe first global dance craze is a softer, desexualised version of a dance that stems back to 19th-century slaves and looks incredibly gentle today. Still, it provoked endearing bafflement among commentators at the time, who likened its \u201cpiston-like motions\u201d to \u201cbaffled bird keepers fighting off a flock of attacking blue jays\u201d.\nThe Macarena has fallen on hard times: macarena.com is canvassing for donations to stay up and running. But the methodical dance to one of the biggest one-hit wonders will live on, at least until the last 90s kid who can do it in their sleep passes away. Hey!\nThe \u201cfaces\u201d of the New York disco scene that inspired Saturday Night Fever were uniquely stylish men (at least, in Nik Cohn\u2019s fabricated Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night feature). But the beauty of the diagonal point-and-bob, so immaculately done by John Travolta, is that any drunk slob can pull it off with aplomb.\nOf all the moves in Single Ladies \u2013 the Bob Fosse-inspired routine that spawned a thousand high-end exercise classes, the finger-waggy \u201chuh oh oh\u201ds aimed at giving nans an easy bit to follow \u2013 none is as arresting as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s final pose as she audibly gasps for breath after nailing it.\nSome of pop history\u2019s finest moments turn on a flash of recontextualisation that sticks for ever: the interview that recast the Spice Girls as Scary, Ginger and co; an outraged Mike Read pulling Relax off air, stoking its notoriety. You can watch one happen when the Village People performed YMCA on Dick Clark\u2019s American Bandstand in January 1979. The group hadn\u2019t choreographed a dance, but the audience, mistaking the band\u2019s raised arms in the chorus for a Y formation, invented one on the spot.

After all, it\u2019s not like they have an English tyro in the club\u2019s academy waiting to make his name in the first team. Callum Hudson-Odoi? Never heard of him. Bayern Munich have made a \u00a330m offer for him, you say? Good one.\nNow we\u2019ve established that there is no such thing as Callum Hudson-Odoi, we can return to the business of Chelsea adding another expensive foreign winger to their squad. Hirving Lozano, available for \u00a336m from PSV Eindhoven, is the candidate to move to Stamford Bridge. You might remember the Mexican winger starring at last summer\u2019s World Cup. He also looked good in the Champions League. But the Mill tips him to be loaned to Valencia in January 2020.\nSpeaking of players who could be off to Spain, \u00c1lvaro Morata is a target for Sevilla. The Chelsea striker could also be followed out of the door by Gary Cahill, who could be bound for Fulham, but Cesc F\u00e0bregas will not be allowed to join Monaco until Maurizio Sarri has a replacement for him. The Mill suggests Jonjo Shelvey. Because it would be funny.\nNow that Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten run is over, J\u00fcrgen Klopp wants to sell most of his squad as punishment. Adam Lallana is off to Fenerbahce and Nathaniel Clyne is a loan target for Bournemouth and Cardiff.\nMario Balotelli could leave Nice for Newcastle. The Italian is exactly the kind of hard-working striker who would flourish under Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Definitely. No problems there. A match made in heaven.\nParis Saint-Germain are set to outbid Barcelona for Ajax starlets Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs De Ligt.\nWhile Juventus are likely to win the race to sign Aaron Ramsey from Arsenal, Mesut \u00d6zil has no plans to leave the north London club, even though he has fallen out of favour under Unai Emery. The Mill would take a similar view if it was on \u00a3350,000 a week for doing nothing.",

The third service will bring Eurostar\u2019s capacity on the route to the equivalent of 12 flights a day, more than 75 flights a week and 3,900 per year.\nThe extra service will leave London St Pancras at 11.04 am, while the departure of the first daily train is being brought forward by 75 minutes to 7.16am, giving business travellers the opportunity of a longer day. The early train will reach Amsterdam at 12.11pm.\nPlans for the highly anticipated service were first announced in September 2013 but the official start date was subject to delays while immigration and passport controls were agreed.\nMore than 4 million passengers a year fly between London and Amsterdam, making it one of Europe\u2019s busiest air routes as the Netherlands grows in popularity as a key business and tourism hub.\nThe Dutch transport secretary, Stientje van Veldhoven, told the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad in October that she was enthusiastic about further rail services and keen to see \u201cas many passengers as possible off the plane for short distances within Europe\u201d.\nAmsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport is under increasing pressure, with slots difficult to obtain at peak times.",

        "content": "As the first woman to present the BBC Radio 1 Rap Show, Calver explains where the genre is heading \u2013 from mental health themes to female empowerment\nAt 24, Tiffany Calver might worry that she has already peaked as a DJ. Initially writing for the pioneering grime platform SBTV and the blog Hypebeast, she began DJing as a hobby, uploading mixes made on free online software to her SoundCloud. Her high-energy selections soon caught the ears of the online station Radar Radio and then Drake\u2019s management, leading her to land a number of firsts: the first woman to make a mix for Drake\u2019s OVO Sound show on Beats 1 Radio, the first woman to have a hip-hop show on Kiss FM, and now the first woman to host BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra\u2019s Rap Show: a popular Saturday-night slot previously held by Tim Westwood and Charlie Sloth.\n\u201cIt still feels so surreal that I\u2019m hosting the show,\u201d she says, ahead of her debut on Saturday. \u201cI remember being a little kid with my mum on Saturday nights listening to Westwood and jumping around my sofa, and now that\u2019ll be me taking over.\u201d Calver is keen to put her own stamp on the show, though. \u201cI just want to express myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in replicating anyone else\u2019s work; I have to be me because I\u2019m not Charlie or Tim.\u201d With rap\u2019s dominance set to continue, we asked her for predictions for 2019.\nThe death of the \u2018meme record\u2019\n\u201cThe viral \u2018shiggy\u2019 dance really helped Drake get In My Feelings to No 1 lastyear, and I haven\u2019t met a single person who doesn\u2019t know Man\u2019s Not Hot by Big Shaq. Both songs show how the internet runs with a joke, but maybe artists will now stop capitalising on this and get back to the music. People are looking for viral hits, but I think audiences are getting tired of the repetitiveness of a joke being taken too far.\u201d\nRecord label Since \u201993\n\u201cIn contrast with these short-lived meme records, labels such as Since \u201993 are honing in on real talent and developing their artists. Their roster is great, with artists such as Fredo, Loski and this kid from Manchester called Aitch. They are all raw musicians and it\u2019s so refreshing to see labels caring about their black artists and nurturing them to create a long-lasting career, rather than capitalising on them as some sort of fad. They\u2019re pure creativity, and 2019 will be a really great year for them.\u201d\nMental health discussions\n\u201cPeople are becoming much more outspoken about their mental health recently. I feel like we have the freedom to talk about what we believe in. In hip-hop, we\u2019re now more open to hearing lyricism rather than just bangers. I love artists such as Kojey Radical: he is so poetic and his lyrics are so conscious of human experiences. There are also great examples set by artists from the older generation like Ghetts and Giggs. Ghetts actually collaborated with Kojey on Black Rose last year, which is all about colourism \u2013 prejudice against darker-skinned women \u2013 which is a huge issue in the black community. Giggs\u2019s The Essence is a very introspective track all about his experiences. Rappers are really growing up and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing what else they\u2019ll be putting out in this vein.\u201d\nNew tastemakers\n\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to see the BBC taking notice of a new generation of tastemakers in our community. People like Snoochie Shy, Kenny Allstar and Jeremiah Asiamah all have slots on Radio 1 and 1Xtra and they\u2019re all incredibly knowledgeable. I remember a time when there was no place for younger voices but now talent is overriding image and people are getting gigs because they\u2019re the best person for it. Snoochie Shy is taking on the 1Xtra rap slot from Monday to Thursday, so essentially Charlie Sloth is being replaced by two women, which is huge for one of the biggest radio stations in the country. I think it\u2019ll have a ripple effect and encourage more women to follow suit.\u201d\nFemale rappers\n\u201cIt was great to hear women such as Rico Nasty, who is unapologetically aggressive, be successful last year because, even as a DJ, I hate it when people tell me I have to \u2018play something for the ladies\u2019, as that doesn\u2019t mean anything. I\u2019m a \u2018lady\u2019 and I want to get into a moshpit! And there\u2019s such a rich history of unapologetic women in hip-hop, from Lil\u2019 Kim to Cardi B and Nicki Minaj. Even rappers such as Noname, who might not have as much of an aggressive sound but can talk about politics and fellatio in the same song, are not afraid to show all the layers there are to being a woman. It isn\u2019t just soft and feminine. I\u2019m excited to see the evolution of the woman in hip-hop in 2019.\u201d\n The Radio 1 Rap Show airs each Saturday, 9-11pm, on Radio 1 and 1Xtra",

This makes Italy the first EU27 country to publicly declare their plans for citizens\u2019 rights post-Brexit, and to provide the reassurance we have been awaiting so long,\u201d said the group in a statement.\nThe Italian breakthrough comes days after immigration officials in Berlin vowed to open an urgent registration process to secure legal status will be in place for them in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal.\nThe Berlin authorities delivered their promise quickly opening the registration process on Thursday 3 January, and telling worried Britons that if there was no deal they would be briefly exempt from German law requiring residency documentation.\n\u201cFrom 30.03.2019 onwards British citizens in Germany will, for an initial period of three months until 30.06.2019, be exempted from the requirement to possess a German residency title,\u201d they said on their website.\nBefore Christmas the French also sought to reassure British nationals in France of their status post-Brexit. Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, said that France would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 resident British citizens living there provided that Britain offered the same guarantees to French expatriates.\nThere are an estimated 60,000 British nationals living and working in Italy who were concerned at the prospect of becoming \u201cirregular\u201d with no rights to reside, work, or access national healthcare or social security if there was no deal.\nWhile British in Italy says they feel reassured that they will not now be illegal, they are concerned that they lose some of their rights including the freedom to move to another EU country or work or offer services in another EU country.\nThis is because negotiations on these rights were set aside, to be discussed at the next Brexit phase of talks on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.\n\u201cI feel a mixture of extreme relief that whatever happens with Brexit we will be able to continue to live legally in our adopted home, but this is coupled with a great anger that I and so many others have been left in this situation for so long when it could have been settled on 27 June 2016,\u201d said Denise Abel, member of British in Italy.\nBut she added: \u201cI thank the Italian government from the bottom of my heart for doing what was promised to us, making it possible for us to continue to live our lives as before. The situation is not perfect for those of us who rely on freedom of movement for our work but at least we Brits in Italy can sleep better in our beds knowing we will not become illegal in our own homes.\u201d\nA fellow member of the campaign group, Carole-Anne Richards, said she had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the news but her immediate feeling was \u201cone of relief\u201d that she won\u2019t be illegal.\n\u201cAt the end of the day the UK government has not ensured my rights will be the same as promised \u2013 they will be significantly diminished,\u201d she said.\nThe absence of freedom of movement affects Britons who work in multiple EU countries and has lead to accusations that the EU and May are leaving them \u201clandlocked\u201d.\nAccording to one of the representative of British in Italy, the Italian state representatives assured them \u201cthey are working on legislation that will be in place by 29 March, so in the event of no deal we will all be legally resident and entitled work and continue with our existing rights now, as they are now\u201d.\nThey said they are hoping to replicate the rights Britons have had under Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement if that is ratified.\nThis will mean British nationals can continue to live and work in the country, but they will still be without some of their rights including the freedom of movement to live or work in another EU country, or the ability to offer services in another country.\nBritish in Europe, the coalition of campaign groups for Britons facing the loss of rights because of Brexit, have accused the UK of abandoning an estimated 1 million Britons who would be left high and dry if the UK crashes out of the block.\nTheresa May and the EU have called on EU member states to be \u201cgenerous\u201d and to ensure Britons\u2019 rights are protected, but there is underlying anger that in 2017 the EU offered to roll over 100% of rights to all those individuals in the UK and the continent affected by Brexit.\nThe UK did not respond to this offer and instead came up with its own version of immigration rules for EU citizens in the UK forcing the EU to negotiate on these terms.",

        "content": "Rising eco-awareness, wellness breaks and a farewell to passports ... we look at changes in the world of travel for the year ahead\nLast October, Club 18-30 holidays staggered off into the sunset, aged 50. To the relief of Mediterranean resorts that had spent decades dealing with the carnage caused by epic drinking challenges, it appears that buckets of warm sangria \u2013 or worse \u2013 have lost their appeal. We have entered the era of the healthy holiday, driven by young people who want to be sober enough to take a flattering selfie. The rise of \u2018ego travel\u2019 was cited by Thomas Cook when it retired the Club 18-30 brand, turning its focus on its Casa Cook and Cook\u2019s Club brands, design-conscious hotels with gyms, tasting menus, upmarket cocktails and yoga.\nBut the staggering rise in wellness tourism \u2013 now worth $639bn globally and growing more than twice as fast as general tourism, according to the Association of Travel Agent\u2019s 2019 Travel Trends report \u2013 isn\u2019t just down to young people. Wellness resorts are targeting all ages, with holidays for every stage of life, from fitness stag dos to baby moons, mumcations and menopause retreats.\nIn the summer, Longevity Health & Wellness Hotel opens on the Algarve with a raft of fitness activities, a medical spa and meals that cater for all sorts of diets. It follows in the footsteps of sports resort FeelViana Hotel, on the coast of Portugal, north of Porto. In Italy, Lefay Resort & Spa\u2019s second resort, Dolomiti, also opening in summer, promises a 24-hour fitness centre and a huge east-meets-west spa.\nBut it\u2019s not just specialist resorts and hotels catering for the demand. Holiday companies such as G Adventures and river cruise operator Uniworld are introducing trips with yoga and meditation sessions and healthy food.Isabel Choat\nLast year was the year the travel industry joined in with the general stand against single-use plastic, with tour operators and hotels clamouring to announce bans on plastic straws or eliminating single-use plastic altogether. Some went further, introducing trips that actively involve holidaymakers in litter clearing and beach clean-ups. This will continue in 2019 as a commitment to tackling the global plastics crisis goes mainstream and consumer pressure grows.\nOver a third (36%) of people would opt for one travel business over another if it has a better environmental record \u2013 up from 23% in 2014, says the Abta report. Last November, Thomas Cook announced its pledge to reduce plastic in its supply chain \u2013 though without saying by how much. Global hotel chain Melia International, which has 370 hotels in 40 countries, will have eliminated all plastics by summer 2019 (in 2017 alone it got through 22 million plastic bottles).\nIn 2019 regulations banning all single-use plastics will come into effect in several destinations, including the Caribbean islands of Aruba and Grenada, the Galapagos and the Californian city of Santa Monica. Single-use plastic is becoming as anti-social as smoking and it would be a brave, or stupid, travel business that didn\u2019t join the fight to help reduce the amount clogging up the planet. Consumers will have to work out which ones are genuinely making a difference and which are just paying lip-service.IC\nWhile sunscreens are crucial for UV protection, recent research indicates that once certain chemical ingredients, particularly oxybenzone and octinoxate, enter the water, they become harmful to humans and nature, and have been implicated in coral reef bleaching.\nIn a world first, last May Hawaii passed legislation that will ban the sale and distribution of any non-prescription sunscreen containing these chemicals (found in 78% of the most popular brands) from 2021. The Caribbean island of Bonaire followed in the same month. The most comprehensive ban so far is in the small Pacific island nation of Palau, which is to ban the buying, selling, importing or manufacturing of sunscreen and skincare products that contain these chemicals and eight additional ones, from 2020.\nThe trend will continue in 2019. More than 30 countries and 19 US states are currently discussing the issue or have bills progressing. Expect more consumer pressure to make manufacturers review and improve their products, and provide clearer labelling.\n  Dr Catherine Wilson, freelance writer specialising in sustainability, tourism and technology\nInstagram has transformed travel. Today, 61% of 18-24-year-olds want to share \u201cbeautiful or important\u201d holiday experiences online (weswap.com). Aware of the power of the \u2019gram, tourist boards, hotels and resorts now pay photographers with large followings to post shots from their hotel or poolside. In doing so they\u2019ve helped the canniest \u2019grammers to forge lucrative careers. The rest of the travel industry has scrambled to get in on the act, slavishly promoting \u201cInstagrammable\u201d trips and places at every opportunity.\nBut the backlash has started, and will be picking up pace in 2019. Spoof accounts such as \u201cyoudidnotsleepthere\u201d, which lampoons adventure travel feeds showing people camping in amazing locations, have been around for a while, but Instagram is now being blamed for more serious offences than encouraging hipster road trips. \u201cInstagram deaths\u201d, caused by people trying to get the perfect shot in precarious locations, and unsustainble crowds, lured to beauty spots by photos seen on the site, are leading some destinations to take action.\nIn autumn 2018, Vienna launched an anti-social media campaign with the slogan \u201cWelcome to Vienna. Not #Vienna\u201d while one Bali resort hit the headlines for banning smartphones by its pool.\nFor every ban, there are hundreds of other destinations desperately promoting themselves as Instagram-friendly, but for those of you who have resolved to scroll less this year, the options for a digital detox are on the rise.IC\nBrexiteers excited about the return of the good old blue British passport will find that their new document\u2019s days are numbered. New facial recognition technology is already being trialled, with Heathrow airport planning a full-scale rollout this summer, introducing biometric technology that uses facial recognition at check-in, bag drops, security lanes and boarding gates, which it claims will reduce time spent at airports by a third. Heathrow says this will be the largest deployment of biometrically enabled products in the world, but it\u2019s not alone in planning for a paperless future: 63% of UK and international airports are planning to invest in biometric ID management by 2020 (source: sita.aero). In Singapore, Changi airport\u2019s new Terminal 4 makes extensive use of biometrics and the Australian government is funding its introduction across that country\u2019s airports. With global air passenger numbers set to double in the next 20 years, anything to smooth the worst part of international travel \u2013 the airport experience \u2013 will be welcomed by many, though experts have also raised concerns about data security.Ryan Ghee of the Future Travel Experience",

Dan Shaked, attorney for plaintiff Mary Conner, said: \u201cThere are many important pictures on beyonce.com that lack a text equivalent \u2026 As a result, Plaintiff and blind beyonce.com customers are unable to determine what is on the website, browse the website or investigate and/or make purchases.\u201d\nThe Guardian has contacted representatives for Beyonc\u00e9 for comment.\nConner is described in the suit as having \u201cno vision whatsoever\u201d.

        "content": "Owners have a right to pick and choose where and when their horses run but this decision looks founded on very limited data\nFour days after it emerged that Paul and Clare Rooney, who have one of the largest strings of jumping horses in the UK, have instructed their trainers to boycott Cheltenham until further notice, both the track and the wider racing public are still waiting for further details about the \u201csafety concerns\u201d that apparently prompted the owners\u2019 decision.\nAll that is clear thus far is that the Rooneys feel that their runners face an increased risk of injury when racing at Cheltenham, and believe that they have statistical evidence to back them up. Paul Rooney seemed to suggest this week that their data will be published in due course but as yet the actual numbers have yet to see the light of day.\nCheltenham, meanwhile, keeps its own detailed records on injuries to runners but these are logged by trainer and jockey rather than a horse\u2019s owner and for now, at least, the track will wait to hear what, if anything, the Rooneys want to add before digging out any data of its own.\nA trawl through the form book from the start of the 2014-15 season, though, shows that in that time the Rooneys have had 44 runners at Cheltenham, two of which \u2013 Starchitect and Melrose Boy \u2013 suffered fatal injury. Five more of their runners at the course since May 2014 have not raced subsequently, but that does not necessarily mean that the horses concerned suffered a career-ending injury there.\nOn the face of it, two fatal injuries to horses from just 44 starts, almost 5%, is far more than any owner should expect to bear, given that the overall rate of fatalities in British racing is around 0.2% of runners (though this figure includes both Flat and National Hunt racing, with jumping accounting for between 2.5 to three times as many fatal injuries).\nYet there is, of course, no in-between when it comes to a fatal injury, and it should also be borne in mind that neither Starchitect nor Melrose Boy died as the result of a fall.\nStarchitect was leading a race between the final two fences when he broke down, which is the sort of incident that, while extremely rare, could happen anywhere. Melrose Boy, meanwhile, was struck into during the Martin Pipe Conditionals\u2019 Handicap Hurdle and put down a few days later. Handicaps at the Festival generally attract maximum fields \u2013 there were 23 in Melrose Boy\u2019s race \u2013 which must slightly increase the chance that one horse will kick another mid-race, but this is a potential reason for avoiding Festival handicaps rather than a complete, indefinite boycott of the track.\nUltimately, a sample of just 44 horses \u2013 or even 244, for that matter \u2013 seems far too small a sample from which to draw a firm conclusion on whether there is a significantly higher risk of injury to runners at Cheltenham, or that the Rooneys have just been very, very unfortunate over the past few seasons.\nA little more certainty should be possible at some stage in the future, as the launch of \u201ca major research project to develop a predictive model for identifying risk factors for all jump racing\u201d was among the 17 recommendations in the British Horseracing Authority\u2019s recent review of last year\u2019s Festival.\nFor now it remains possible \u2013 indeed quite likely \u2013 that the risk of fatal injury for runners at Cheltenham in general, and at the Festival above all, is slightly higher than it is at many other tracks. The Festival is the most important meeting of the season by far and everything is travelling a little bit quicker and trying a little bit harder from the off.\nHowever, any increased risk \u2013 if it exists at all \u2013 can only be marginal when set against the much more significant increase that arises from asking horses to jump at least eight obstacles in the first place, as opposed to racing on the Flat. And perhaps, in the end, this is the Rooneys\u2019 direction of travel, as their dark blue and yellow colours have been seen more frequently on the level in recent seasons, most notably aboard My Dream Boat, the winner of the Group One Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2016.\nPaul and Clare Rooney have sunk millions into racing under both codes in recent seasons and had runners from nearly 20 different jumping stables last season. They have an absolute right to pick and choose where and when their horses run and have suffered, by any measure, some terrible luck at Cheltenham recently.\nFew would blame them for deciding to boycott the track for no other reason than painful memories and superstition. The apparent link to safety concerns, though, is an implied criticism of Cheltenham\u2019s welfare standards and professionalism, and appears to be based on very meagre evidence.\nThere is a sense that the January weather is slowly closing in ahead of a possible spell of very cold weather next week, but Lingfield\u2019s jumps card survived an 8am inspection on Friday morning and there is a full programme of four meetings as a result.\nHint Of Grey (1.30) and Bonza Girl (3.05) should both go well at the Surrey course while Abbreviate (1.45) has an obvious chance on the jumps card at Wetherby.\nThe two most valuable meetings are on the all-weather, however, with Family Fortunes (3.50) making plenty of appeal at around 7-2 at Kempton Park. Michael Madgwick\u2019s gelding remains in good form having won over course and distance in November, while Freedom And Wheat (6.45), a winner on his final start at two years old last time out, should start his three-year-old career in similar vein.\nLingfield 12.30 Arkyn 1.00 Geordie B 1.30 Hint Of Grey 2.00 The Game Is A Foot 2.35 Bastien 3.05 Bonza Girl 3.40 Bonds Conquest\u00a0\nWetherby 12.45 Statuario 1.15 Little Millie 1.45 Abbreviate 2.20 Redzor 2.55 Nortonthorpelegend 3.30 Prince Llywelyn \u00a0\nKempton\u00a02.10 Magicinthemaking\u00a02.45\u00a0Blaze Of Hearts 3.15 Anycity 3.50 Family Fortunes (nap) 4.20 Deep Intrigue 4.50 Arlecchino\u2019s Arc 5.20 Far Cry\u00a0\nWolverhampton 4.05 Tarseekh 4.35 Tor\u00a05.10 Jeremy\u2019s Jet 5.45 Skydiving 6.15 Viola Park 6.45 Freedom And Wheat (nb) 7.15 Robert L\u2019Echelle 7.45 Proceed",

        "content": "Union boss Minette Batters says tariffs would price British farms out of export market\nThe UK\u2019s farmers face a profound crisis in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and there is dangerous ground ahead even if a deal is agreed, according to the head of the National Farmers\u2019 Union.\nMinette Batters, the union\u2019s first female leader, is determined to be cautiously positive about Brexit, for which a majority of farmers voted. \u201cWe have to embrace the future \u2026 and make sure we have a goal and a plan,\u201d said Batters, who declined to reveal how she voted in the referendum.\nBut she is extremely worried by the possibility of no deal. In that case, she said, the government had \u201cmade it clear that they would obliterate the tariff wall on food so that products could just keep coming in here without a tax \u2013 that is what they\u2019ve said. Which makes sense, because who wants to see food prices rising?\u201d\nA government briefing in December suggested that in the event of no deal, the government could allow some products to continue to enter the UK without paying a tariff to keep food prices stable.\nBatters pointed out that UK farmers would have third-party status and would face high tariffs to sell their goods into Europe. \u201cWe\u2019d be priced out of the market,\u201d she said, claiming that the result for UK farmers would be catastrophic. \u201cForty per cent of our lamb goes to Europe, for just one example. We\u2019re not going to suddenly start eating more lamb here. If we don\u2019t have that export market, what happens to it?\u201d\nSome experts have predicted that 25% or more of farmers could go out of business in the first year, which Batters does not think is impossible.\nBritish food should be selling itself around the world on its high welfare standards and environmental stewardship, Batters argues, and she has laid down an ambition for UK farming to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. \u201cWe want to have a big British brand and going to net zero is part of that ambition \u2026 part of a much bigger joined-up plan that delivers on many fronts for society.\u201d\nAnimal welfare and environmental campaigners point out the irony of these moves from the NFU, which resisted environmental and welfare reforms for years.\nBatters also has reservations about Michael Gove\u2019s plans to move UK farmers away from the EU system of subsidies based on land area and towards a \u201cpublic money for public goods system\u201d, where farmers would be paid for environmental services. The environment secretary\u2019s agriculture bill will go to the House of Lords this month: under its terms, the current subsidy system would be phased out over seven years and the new system phased in.\nBoth Batters and environmental campaigners are concerned that despite trumpeting high UK standards, the government refuses to include them in the legislation. The US has said it will only do a trade deal with the UK if it accepts America\u2019s very different food standards, and there are fears that the British government is trying to leave the door open for a possible US deal, which would have a huge impact on UK farmers.\n\u201cIt would be very unfair on British farmers and consumers if they were then subjected to product coming in where they\u2019ve had access to things that we\u2019ve had banned in this country,\u201d said Batters.\nThe shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, told the Oxford Farming Conference this week: \u201cThe rhetoric has been great on standards.\u201d But Gardiner said that during the progress of the legislation, every time Labour tried to add amendments to get the standards included, the Conservatives made sure the amendments failed.\n\u201cLiam Fox is still up for a \u2018quick and massive deal\u2019 with the US,\u201d Gardiner said, claiming that lower food standards could be imposed under the powers the government has given itself.\nBrexit is just one of a number of existential issues faced by farmers in the next 10 years. A tax is being proposed on red meat, known to be a significant contributor to climate change. Meanwhile, innovative companies around the world have been creating alternatives to milk and meat that are starting to eat up large chunks of the market. Gene editing, robotics and big data are all growing in influence, each presenting different challenges.\nSo are UK farmers ready for the tidal wave of change that is coming their way? \u201cNo,\u201d said Batters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good thing that we have seven years to look at turning things around.\u201d",

But if she were to receive a shorter custodial sentence, a recall petition would automatically be triggered.\nLavery said Labour would \u201cactively support\u201d such a petition, which would need to be endorsed by 10% of the electorate in the Cambridgeshire marginal over a six-week period to trigger a Westminster byelection.\nIn an interview with the Peterborough Telegraph, Lavery added: \u201cYou voted for a Labour party person. Unfortunately the people of Peterborough were failed. We want a Labour party MP here who will do the people of Peterborough a great service.\u201d\n Lavery\u2019s remarks and Onasanya\u2019s expulsion mean that it is almost certain a byelection will take place in a seat Labour took by 607 votes in 2017, forcing out Stewart Jackson, who had held the seat for the Conservatives for 12 years.\nOnasanya would be able to stand as a candidate if a recall petition was successfully triggered, but not for Labour as she has been thrown out, in a seat where the Tories will also fancy their chances.\nLavery said: \u201cFiona isn\u2019t a member of the Labour party \u2013 she isn\u2019t a Labour MP.\u201d He repeated the party\u2019s call for her to resign her seat, adding: \u201cWe would be raring to go for a byelection. We\u2019re up for it.\n\u201cThe people in Peterborough want a Labour MP \u2013 they voted for a Labour MP the last time and I\u2019m absolutely confident from what we have to offer that we would win a byelection in the very near future if one was to be held.\u201d\nA 35-year-old solicitor, Onasanya, was convicted at a retrial of colluding with her brother Festus after her car was clocked going 41mph in a 30mph zone in the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, in July 2017.\nShe was immediately suspended by Labour and told to resign, but did not do so. In a column in the Peterborough Telegraph over Christmas, Onasanya indicated she would continue as an MP.\nMaking no mention of her conviction, she said constituents should \u201crest assured\u201d that she would remain their representative fighting injustice in the corridors of power.\nShortly after the conviction, Onasanya sent a message to parliamentary colleagues on a WhatsApp group, likening her predicament to those of biblical figures, including Jesus, who had been found guilty by the courts of their day, and asking them to pray for her.\nIn her trial, the court was told she was sent a notice of intended prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the guilty driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of Festus who was away visiting his parents in Russia.\nFestus pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice, including the 24 July incident.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAh, excellent point. You\u2019ve noticed that you can\u2019t actually see my ankles. But here\u2019s the thing: you can see that I have ankles. Bear with me. What I mean is that you might notice my ankles, even though you can\u2019t see them, because my skirt is of a length that shows ankle, rather than leg, so it points to these rather eye-catching boots. If I had been wearing this skirt five years ago, I would probably have worn it with dark-coloured high heels, because it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me to make ankles a focal point; but in 2019 it calls for a jazzy ankle boot.\nThe jazzy ankle boot is one of those trends that started as a silly fling and, against the odds, stuck. It stuck because it is simple and effective. My absolute favourite fashion tricks are the kind that are big on impact but don\u2019t make your life difficult. A well-chosen pair of spectacular earrings, for instance: they fit into your handbag, and turn a black sweater and jeans into a passable evening look. A pair of interesting ankle boots with a modest heel works along the same lines. They transform a midi skirt, or trousers or jeans cropped at the ankle, into an interesting look.\nThe ankle boot has risen as hemlines have fallen. An ankle boot is not particularly flattering, so when skirts were short and leg-lengthening illusions were called for, it didn\u2019t really work. But when your skirt shows only a few inches of ankle, there is really no need to get hung up on leg-lengthening illusions. (There was never actually any point getting hung up on leg-lengthening illusions in the first place; but most of us feel those pressures and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to pretend we don\u2019t.)\nIt is not only skirts that have a new hemline. Trouser length has changed, too. It used to be that trousers were worn as long as possible without touching the ground, covering as much of the shoe as possible, stretching out the leg and disappearing the ankle. But the toe of a shoe pointing out from your hem doesn\u2019t look quite right now. A hem that lands on or a bit above your ankle is the thing. A jazzy ankle boot slots into that gap nicely. It doesn\u2019t need to colour-match with your bag or clothes, so one pair will work for most outfits. Try a pair. You may find yourself smitten.\n Jess wears polo neck, \u00a3115, essentiel-antwerp.com. Skirt, \u00a3120, boden.co.uk. Boots, \u00a3250, gestuz.com.

        "content": "Want evidence of the transformative power of a good FA Cup run? Look no further than Lincoln City. The money that the club earned from reaching the sixth round two seasons ago funded the construction of a \u00a31.3m training facility into which they moved less than a fortnight ago, just in time to begin preparations for Saturday\u2019s third-round tie against Everton.\n\u201cThis simply can\u2019t compare with what we had before,\u201d says the midfielder Lee Frecklington as he steps off one of three state-of-the-art pitches built on 12 acres of land that had been used for growing onions until Lincoln took out a long-term lease on it this time last year. The complex just opposite RAF Scampton also features a gym, a canteen, video analysis infrastructure, spacious changing rooms and a massage suite.\nSuch progress is one reason that Frecklington agreed to move back to his home town last January, dropping down a division by leaving Rotherham United and rejoining the club for whom he made over 100 appearances after starting out as a teenager in 2003. \u201cMy memories of back then are of reporting to the stadium [Sincil Bank, just off the city\u2019s high street] in the mornings and not really knowing where we were going to train, whether it would be in a local park or a local school, it could have been anywhere,\u201d says the 33-year-old. \u201cTo come here and see this building just shows how far the club has come.\u201d\nLincoln were still training on school pitches two seasons ago when they became the first non-league side in over 100 years to reach the last eight of the FA Cup, beating Ipswich, Brighton and Burnley before being eliminated by Arsenal. Even this season players had to change at a local college and then drive to the new training pitch until the completion of their dressing room last month. \u201cWe were able to change in the new place for the first time on Christmas Eve,\u201d says Frecklington. \u201cIt makes such a difference to have a base. Now we can come here every day and not worry about travelling, just focus solely on football. We get a lot more work done. If you are going to drop levels when you move club, it\u2019s important you go to a team that\u2019s on the way up and that\u2019s the way this club has been going for a couple of years now.\u201d\nLincoln combined their Cup exploits two seasons ago with a triumphant return to the Football League after a four-year absence. In their first season back, during which Frecklington rejoined, they reached the League Two play-offs. This season they are top. Sincil Bank fills close to its 10,000-capacity for nearly every home match and Lincoln will take at least half that number of fans to Goodison Park on Saturday.\n\u201cThe fact that the club reached the quarter-finals two years ago and won the National League created a buzz that has just carried on,\u201d says Frecklington.\nThe continued success is testament to the savviness of the managerial duo of Danny and Nicky Cowley, brothers who have delivered consistent performances while upgrading more than just the training facilities. Frecklington\u2019s arrival was part of squad enhancement that means only two of the players who started against Arsenal in 2017 are still at the club. With a higher quality of player has come a slightly more intricate style of play. Frecklington admits that the team\u2019s directness when he arrived last year took him aback.\n\u201cI did find it difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember my first game against Notts County, who played a very direct style of football, which is also what Lincoln were playing at the time, so midfielders didn\u2019t get a lot of the ball. It took me a while to understand what they wanted from me. But Lincoln had done so well playing that way that it was up to me to adapt. I think this year I\u2019ve grown into the role a little more and we\u2019re playing a little bit more football and it suits me now more than when I first came.\u201d\nThe Cowleys do an extraordinary amount of homework before matches. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so well informed about opponents,\u201d says Frecklington. \u201cIt can be difficult spending a lot of time in the classroom when footballers just want to be outside but you realise that the better you prepare off the pitch, the easier things become on it.\u201d\nNot that Lincoln expect anything to be easy against Everton. But at least they have a plan for making life hard for their Premier League hosts. Frecklington has no qualms about plotting a direct approach. \u201cWe know that if it\u2019s a possession game, Everton will beat us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to find a way of playing that they\u2019re not going to like. Set pieces are going to be a massive part of that. But to get set pieces you have to have the ball so we have a lot of work to do on that part of the game.\u201d\nHe is under no illusions about how tough that will be. He remembers a fourth-round tie he played in 2010 for Peterborough against Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cIt was probably the longest 90 minutes I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d he says. \u201cThe beat us 4-0 but, if not for our goalkeeper, it could have been 10. That\u2019s the problem you face as a lower league team: if you meet a Premier League team on their day, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. We will prepare the best we can but we\u2019ve still got to hope Everton do not have a good day and we have an unbelievable one.\u201d",

        "content": "US and African Union press DRC to respect result of poll on 30 December\nPressure is growing on the electoral commission of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to release the results of last week\u2019s election on time after the Catholic church said there was a clear winner and it knew who had been elected the next president.\nThe US state department, the African Union and the Catholic church, which wields significant power in the central African country, have all urged the country\u2019s government to respect the result.\nOpposition members fear the election may be rigged in favour of Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, the ruling party candidate who was handpicked by the current president, Joseph Kabila.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo's sheer size, its political history and its myriad problems are all reasons why observers have followed its election so closely.\nThe vast, resource-rich country, with a population of 80 million spread over an area the size of western Europe, has never known a peaceful transition of power since its independence from Belgium in 1960.\nIt remains one of the poorest places in the world, racked by war and disease and with massive inequality. In the east, where scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines, an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. Countrywide an estimated 4.3 million people are displaced.\u00a0\nIt is still recovering from a civil war triggered by the fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, in which 4 million people died. Joseph Kabila has been in power as president since his father, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.\nThe country\u2019s problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago, which is why December\u2019s much-delayed election was invested with so much hope and trepidation.\u00a0\u00a0\nChaos at polling stations on the day of the vote dampened hopes that the election would bring a measure of political stability.\u00a0 The announcement by the electoral commission on 10 January that Felix Tshisekedi had won confounded polling that had put another opposition figure well in front and raised fears of a backroom deal ultimately keeping Kabila in power.\nThe Catholic church, which sent more than 40,000 observers to polling stations across the country, said it knew who the winner was, urging the national electoral commission (CENI) to publish the result.\nIt stopped short of giving the winner\u2019s name, as this is illegal in the DRC, but several observers said it signalled that Shadary had lost.\n\u201cWe call on the CENI, as an institution supporting democracy, to respect truth and justice, taking full responsibility as it publishes election results,\u201d the national episcopal conference of Congo (Cenco) said in a statement.\nThe results of the election on 30 December are due on Sunday, but the electoral commission has indicated that delays are likely.\nThe government has cut internet access and blocked SMS messaging, as well as blocking the signals of two broadcasters and withdrawing a French correspondent\u2019s accreditation, in what Angela Quintal, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, called a \u201csystematic campaign of censorship\u201d.\nThe government hit back at the allegations. \u201cStop intimidating us,\u201d Congolese media reported the electoral commission head, Corneille Nangaa, as saying. \u201cStop trying to influence the CENI decision. The CENI will announce the results in accordance with the law and the results it collected in all polling stations.\u201d\nLambert Mende, the minister of communications, defended the internet shutdown and the revocation of the accreditation of the Radio France International correspondent. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not a sort of zoo in which thrill-seeking tourists from the whole world are invited by pyromaniacs to see savages fighting in a lawless land.\u201d\nPresident Kabila\u2019s mandate expired in 2016 but he delayed elections by more than two years, arguing that an important census had not yet been held to count the number of voters, and that the country could not find the \u00a31.4bn it said it needed to hold an election. He has ruled the country since 2001, when his father was assassinated.\nPolling just before the election showed a large majority of Congolese supported the opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu, a former businessman.\nThe same poll showed almost half of respondents said they would protest against a rigged election, and more than half said they would not accept the result if Shadary was declared the winner.\nThe US threatened sanctions against officials attempting to undermine democracy.\nRobert Palladino, a state department spokesman, said: \u201cThose responsible for undermining democratic institutions and processes, threatening the peace, security, or stability of DRC or benefiting from corruption \u200ewill be held accountable.\n\u201cThose who undermine the democratic process, threaten the peace, security or stability of the DRC, or benefit from corruption may find themselves not welcome in the United States and cut off from the US financial system. There are moments in every nation\u2019s history when individuals and political leaders step forward and do the right thing. This is one of those moments for the DRC.\u201d\nJason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group at New York university, said the DRC was \u201cin a different universe\u201d after the church\u2019s statement.\n\u201cI think it is a very crucial moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kabila\u2019s going to step down tomorrow ... but we had always suspected there were going to be flaws in the electoral process, there were certainly many suspicions that they could be rigged in favour of the ruling coalition but to have the Catholic church step up and say we know who won these elections, we have proof and we will publish \u2013 that is very different from just saying the process has been flawed.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make sure we don\u2019t end up in a situation where CENI announces different results, there are then inevitable protests in the streets that turn violent, there\u2019s a regime that digs in its heels and they end up in an ugly confrontation. To be honest, that\u2019s where I think we\u2019re going to end up.\u201d\nPerhaps only way it wouldn\u2019t, he said, was if the South African and Angolan presidents, the African Union chair and Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, all got together and told Kabila: \u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over, step down or else.\u201d\nThat is unlikely \u2013 Kabila is in a powerful position, as the DRC is the largest copper producer in Africa and produces 60% of the world\u2019s cobalt, which is used in lithium-ion batteries for smartphones and electric cars.",

The average house price in the UK last month was \u00a3212,281 compared to \u00a3211,156 in December 2017, and just under \u00a3206,000 two years ago.\nUncertainty over the economic outlook appeared to be undermining confidence in the market, it warned.\nHowever, there were wide regional variations in house price growth in 2018, with London and surrounding areas reporting a small fall.\nNorthern Ireland had the biggest house price rises, up 5.8%. Prices in Wales climbed 4%, in Scotland they were up 0.9% and across England they rose 0.7% on average.\nNationwide said it expected prices to rise at a \u201clow single-digit pace\u201d in 2019 but its forecast is dependent on the economy continuing to grow modestly, something that looks \u201cunusually uncertain\u201d.\nBritain\u2019s housing market has weakened since the June 2016 Brexit vote, led by price falls in London.

        "content": "It was back to business as usual for Magnus Carlsen in last weekend\u2019s world blitz championship at St Petersburg. Norway\u2019s world No 1, 28, had earlier made a dreadful start of two losses in the 15-minute rapid championship, and his subsequent recovery fell half a point short of the young Russian Daniil Dubov.\nBut in the 21-round blitz, defined as three minutes per player for the entire game plus a two seconds per move increment, Carlsen was pushing from the start. Admittedly he rode his luck on occasions, and in the very first round his opponent could have trivially drawn a bishop and pawns ending by non-committal moves but instead exchanged off into a lost pawn ending.\nThe pivotal moment came on the first day in rounds seven and eight when Carlsen outclassed first Jan-Krzysztof Duda, the 20-year-old Polish No 1 who will soon be among the elite, and then Alireza Firouzja, 15. The Iranian talent, who finished an impressive sixth in the rapid and was named in last week\u2019s column as a player to watch in the blitz, began brilliantly with victories over several eminent opponents and reached 6.5/7, ahead of Carlsen and others on 5.5, The world champion did what he had to do and trounced the teen, who could not recover and finished down the field.\nIn the final rounds Carlsen was chased all the way by Duda, who finished half a point behind. Hikaru Nakamura, a speed specialist and the only top American to compete, won bronze, as he had done in the rapid.\nEngland\u2019s only representative was Gawain Jones, fresh from his victory in the British knockout championship at Olympia whose format included classical, rapid and blitz. Jones made no show in the rapid and began the blitz with 0/3, but then suddenly took off, scoring 10.5 from the next 12 rounds, zooming up the score table, and meeting Duda in round 16. There the dream ended, as Jones missed a hidden Rc6 resource at move 20, Duda produced a knockout two moves later and the 31-year-old subsided in the final six rounds.\nThe open rapid and blitz each had medal prizes of $60,000, $ 50,000 and $40,000, much of which came from the Saudis. The event was formally titled the King Salman World Rapid and Blitz Championships, but Riyadh, the controversial 2017 host, would not provide visas to Israel or Iran either last year or this.\nHence a bizarre compromise, whereby the 2017 name continued, five Saudi competitors rated far below the nominal 2500 minimum were included at St Petersburg, and it was announced that neither alcohol nor pork would be available. The event attracted several thousand spectators every day, a rarity when most chess viewing is now online.\nThe separate women\u2019s championships had main prizes totalling $90,000, which attracted almost all the world\u2019s top players. China\u2019s Ju Wenjun won the rapid and Russia\u2019s Kateryna Lagno the blitz. They were the form pair as finalists in the classical championship played in November, but the star in St Petersburg was Sara Khadem, 21, who won silver in both rapid and blitz. The Iranian could not have competed if the event had been in Riyadh.\nThe main championships were technically open but women entrants were absent, no surprise considering the large rewards available in the all-women events. It could have been different if the all-time Nos 1 and 2, Hungary\u2019s Judit Polgar and China\u2019s Hou Yifan, had been available.\nPolgar, 42 and retired from competitive chess, played virtually only against men throughout her career while Hou, now concentrating on her Rhodes Scholarship MSc degree at Oxford, prefers male opponents.\nCarlsen enjoyed his win in round 13, the first on the second day of blitz, against his old nemesis Anish Giri. There has long been needle between them, mostly conducted on Twitter, since Wijk aan Zee 2011 when the Dutchman won as Black in only 22 moves, and for years could boast of his plus score against the champion. Carlsen could not equalise the totals until Bilbao 2016 and then had another bad experience at Wijk 2017, where he failed to find an obvious way to mate in three or win Giri\u2019s queen.\nSo after their blitz game, in which Giri fell into his opponent\u2019s prep and flagged with mate imminent, Carlsen told Norwegian television: \u201cThere are many who have fantasies as to what is the best way to start the day. This is mine.\u201d\nBlack can keep the game level by 9\u2026Ba5! while 12\u2026Qd7 13 0-0 Qe6 is still a game. Carlsen erred by 22 c5?! when 22 Bxa7! Rxa7 23 Qd4 forks both rooks.

        "content": "Twelve years after JK Rowling\u2019s final book in the wizarding series, why is everything from Quidditch slippers to Hedwig lip balms still flying off the shelves?\nIn November 2001, Private Eye mocked the Pottermania surrounding the franchise\u2019s first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. The magazine fabricated ridiculous-sounding merchandise, satirically advertising the \u201cHarry Potter potato peeler\u201d, the \u201cLord Voldemort wheelie bin\u201d and \u201cQuidditch drawing pins\u201d.\nWhat was once ridiculous is now reality. In 2018, you can pop into Sainsbury\u2019s, Lakeland or WH Smith and pick up the Harry Potter egg cup and toast cutter set (\u00a35). Multiple British brands have launched exclusive Potter ranges: Boots introduced wand-shaped makeup brushes (\u00a320) and Hedwig lip balms (\u00a36); the stationery shop Typo brought out oversized turquoise Quidditch slippers (\u00a315); and Primark\u2019s Hagrid bauble (\u00a35) made pre-Christmas headlines.\nTwelve years after the last book, why are Potter products ubiquitous?\n\u201cHarry Potter has really broad appeal to a diverse group of customers, from original Potter fans to those discovering the stories and films for the very first time,\u201d says Mark Haynes, a Boots senior buying manager. Haynes says the cosmetics collection was on Boots\u2019s \u201cwish list\u201d for \u201csome time\u201d, but was launched last year because Potter franchises remain \u201cundiminished\u201d.\nOf course, Potter merchandise is not new \u2013 Marks & Spencer had a range in the early 00s. Yet everything changed last March, when Warner Bros announced a new brand: WIZARDING WORLD\u2122. Encapsulating Harry Potter and JK Rowling\u2019s new franchise Fantastic Beasts, this allowed Potter merchandise to be sold under a new umbrella (incidentally, an officially licensed colour-changing umbrella is \u00a329.99).\n\u201cWe have noticed from our customers that the increasing demand does not stop at the Fantastic Beasts collection, but extends back to the whole Harry Potter universe,\u201d says a spokesperson for Cinereplicas, an official wholesaler. Cinereplicas says customers who were once happy with Hogwarts scarves now want \u201cmore\u201d, and its customer base has \u201cdiversified\u201d \u2013 the high-end Parisian department store Galeries Lafayette recently held a pop-up Potter shop.\n\u201cAs the Harry Potter universe matures and returns, they are seeking \u2018magic-infused\u2019 day-to-day items: fashionable non-replica clothing, kitchenware, stationery,\u201d says Cinereplicas. In 2018, the wholesaler launched hair accessories, infinity scarves and cookie cutters \u2013 each \u201ca big hit\u201d.\nWith the final Fantastic Beasts due in 2024, wizarding merchandise isn\u2019t going away. Undoubtedly, the Voldemort wheelie bin is coming soon.",

        "content": "Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, A-Cold-Wall* and David Beckham star, as interest in menswear booms\nThe British menswear market has plenty to be pleased about. With London fashion week men\u2019s poised to kick off on Saturday, reports reveal men in the UK are spending an increasing amount on fashion.\nIn 2018, consumer spending on men\u2019s fashion grew by 5.1% to reach \u00a315.9bn. And, according to the editor of GQ, Dylan Jones, it all starts with what will be presented this weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s always a trickle-down effect,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWhat happens on these catwalks now affects what people will be buying in a few years\u2019 time.\u201d\nJones said a \u201creally powerful new generation of UK talent\u201d had helped London fashion week become more exciting than its New York, Milan and Paris counterparts.\nAmong the brands presenting their autumn/winter 2019 collections this weekend are Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Craig Green and A-Cold-Wall*. Jones said these designers \u201chave the same zeitgeist feel we saw with BodyMap in the 80s and Alexander McQueen in the 90s\u201d.\nThe appointment of David Beckham as ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council (BFC) this year has further boosted London fashion week men\u2019s. The former footballer, who will present a catwalk show for his brand, Kent & Curwen, on Sunday, told the Guardian: \u201cMore than ever, we have a real responsibility to engage and promote young and emerging creative talent.\n\u201cThis industry should be an option for kids from across the UK, no matter what background they come from. I have been most inspired by the workshops we have been doing with children at school age. Their energy and creativity is just incredible and that\u2019s why I am doing this.\u201d\nThis season there would be more Asian designers \u2013 such as Xander Zhou and Feng Chen Wang \u2013 than ever before, said Jones, who credited the \u201ctalismanic effect\u201d of Beckham.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget the huge profile he has internationally, especially in Asia,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more relationships built with Asia, and a lot of the funding for our menswear and our GQ/BFC fund \u2013 which will be announced on Monday \u2013 comes from there. He\u2019s been a tremendous success.\u201d\nBeckham said: \u201cLondon is a global city and fashion and design is in demand from a global audience. It\u2019s great that Asian brands believe that showing in London gives them a chance to reach that audience.\u201d\nAlthough many fear Brexit may deter budding designers from setting up studios in the UK, as well as affecting established brands, the BFC has pledged to continue to invest heavily in mentoring schemes and initiatives to support the wider industry.\nDespite the upbeat tone, the London fashion pack is mourning the death of the designer Joe Casely-Hayford, who dressed the Clash and U2 early in his career. An influential presence on the British fashion scene, he frequently showed his collections at London fashion week.\nThe fashion critic Sarah Mower told British Vogue: \u201cIt\u2019s poignant that the London menswear shows are starting on Brick Lane on Saturday,\u201d the fashion critic Sarah Mower told British Vogue, referring to how Casely-Hayford was long associated with that area of east London.\nMower said he was the \u201cfirst London designer to bring the cultural mix and energy of the East End together with the amazing skills of a Savile Row tailor\u201d, paving the way for many newcomers presenting their collections this weekend.\nCharles Jeffrey Loverboy\nDespite his brand being less than three years old, the Glaswegian designer has won numerous prestigious awards. His radical nightclub-meets-couture aesthetic resulted in US Vogue recently calling him \u201cLondon\u2019s pioneering Pied Piper of the creative, queer club scene\u201d.\nCraig Green\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate is in London after a stint at the menswear shows in Florence last year. His beautifully crafted and conceptual designs have been credited with setting the mainstream menswear agenda. Green is tipped to be snapped up by a big fashion house soon.\nA-Cold-Wall*\nThe whirlwind success of Samuel Ross and his label was capped by the self-taught London-based designer winning the emerging talent prize at the Fashion awards last month. A protege of Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director, Virgil Abloh, Ross has cut a unique path in futuristic streetwear inspired by race, architecture and class.",

        "content": "Robert and Avril Smith sold thousands of tickets but broke Gambling Commission rules \nIn November 2015, Avril and Robert Smith\u2019s lives changed forever. Their 39-year-old daughter died suddenly and the family home became too many painful to remain in.\nAfter repeated attempts to sell the house via conventional methods, including three price reductions, they were unable to secure a buyer.\nIn desperation, they decided to try another, more risky, method. In August last year, their son, Matthew, suggested they try to raffle the four-bedroom property in the tiny North Yorkshire village of Grosmont.\nBut Robert, 75, and Avril, 68, remain the reluctant owners of their home. Almost five months after launching the prize scheme with hopes to sell 60,000 of the \u00a310 tickets they were told to close down the competition. The couple had fallen foul of Gambling Commission rules and were told that it was not a legal prize competition as it had been deemed a potential lottery.\nRobert, a former lawyer, told the Guardian that the decision by the commission to pull the competition had been a \u201cbolt out of the blue\u201d and that he and his wife were still recovering from the shock. Smith claimed that he had contacted the commission in July to make it aware of the prize draw but he was informed of its decision only a few days before Christmas when thousands of tickets had already been bought.\n\u201cWhen Rachael died suddenly we decided we could no longer stay here,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere were so many memories, we brought her here as a baby, they grew up here. It became too painful.\n\u201cWe\u2019re both also getting old and want to be near our grandchildren \u2013 help out with them and allow our son to look after us a bit too \u2013 but now we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ll try and sell it again but it could take a while.\u201d\nThe Smiths had joined a growing number of homeowners who are trying to sell their properties through \u201cwin a house\u201d schemes. Raffle tickets are sold at a low cost and the sellers hope they can make up the sale price and pick one winner.\nThe slowdown in the property market over the past year has led to an increase in the number of properties being offered as raffle prizes, in particular by homeowners who fail to achieve their desired asking price.\nFor some, like Dunstan Low, who last year decided to raffle off his six-bedroom, grade II listed home, Melling Manor, the method was a success after he added a free entry option in the prize draw to avoid breaching gambling regulations. His \u201cwin a country home\u201d competition netted him \u00a31m in ticket sales for his property, the east wing of an 18th-century manor house in Lancashire.\nThe Smiths\u2019 daughter, Rachael, moved to Spain in 2015 to begin a new life with her partner. But just three weeks after leaving the UK she was found dead in her apartment. She died from sudden death syndrome.\nLater that year, Robert and Avril put their family home of 42 years on the market to move closer to Matthew, 45, and their two grandchildren.\nAvril, breaking down in tears, says: \u201cWe loved this home, we have lots of friends and the community is very close but after Rachael died everything changed. She still has her bedroom here and what happened was devastating.\n\u201cIt was a lovely home but we need to make a fresh start, begin a new chapter in our lives and put some things behind us.\u201d\nThe winner was originally to be drawn on Thursday, but the couple said they were \u201cback to square one\u201d, and now begins the laborious task of refunding more than 6,000 people who bought one or more tickets.\nThey said they had already extended the draw date to August after the charity Cancer Research UK had agreed to help promote it in 2019. They had hoped to raise up to \u00a360,000 for the charity through the sale. Avril was diagnosed with cancer of the womb 10 years ago.\nThe home, which has previously been valued at \u00a3550,000, has an outdoor heated pool, log cabin, orangery and hot tub. The Smiths said the house was now open to offers in the normal way and ticket refunds could be claimed through the website.\nIf a raffle is deemed to be an illegal lottery by the Gambling Commission, it could attract a fine of up to \u00a35,000 and a 51-week prison sentence for the raffle organiser. In a statement, the commission said it had a duty to \u201cprevent illegal gambling\u201d and that this prize draw had been considered a lottery.",

The men arrested on Thursday in London were named as Andrew Pearse, Surjan Singh and Detelina Subeva, who were arrested in connection with allegations of defrauding investors.\nUS prosecutors allege the former Credit Suisse bankers intentionally circumvented antifraud measures set in place by their employer between 2011 and 2013 in order to set up and execute the fraud, while using personal emails to conceal their involvement.\nThe international scam caused the International Monetary Fund to suspend its assistance to Mozambique, leading to a crash in the country\u2019s economy.\nPearse, Singh and Subeva have been released on bail pending extradition proceedings by the US authorities. If they and others are convicted of violating US anti-bribery provisions they could face fines of up to $100,000 or a five-year prison sentence per violation, in addition to up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of up to $500,000 for money laundering.\nIn a press release, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse confirmed the involvement of three former Credit Suisse staff: \u201cThe indictment alleges that the former employees worked to defeat the bank\u2019s internal controls, acted out of a motive of personal profit, and sought to hide these activities from the bank.\u201d\nConfirming no charges have been brought against the bank the spokesperson added: \u201cCredit Suisse will continue to cooperate with relevant regulators following these indictments, and separately looks forward to continuing to work with the relevant authorities to move forward with the proposed debt restructuring.\u201d\nTim Jones, policy officer at the global debt monitor Jubilee Debt Campaign, attacked the UK\u2019s lack of action and said Mozambique should not be expected to repay the loan. \u201cIt is scandalous that it has required action from the US authorities for this investigation and arrests to be made in London.\nHe said: \u201cCredit Suisse should immediately drop its debt claim against the Mozambique people, and call on other owners of the debt to do the same. They should pursue the money from the individuals and banks responsible, not the people of Mozambique.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe Mozambique people should not have to repay one cent on a debt they had no say over and no benefit from.\u201d\nOmar Remane, from the diplomatic and economic affairs department at the Mozambique high commission in London, confirmed to the Guardian last week that \u201cnegotiations in London between the government of Mozambique and its creditors has led to an agreement in principle over 60% of the debt\u201d and that further discussions were under way, an indication that the country would still have to repay its creditors despite the international fraud investigation.",

Asked for more details, he ended the call.\nIreland started rolling out abortion services on 1 January in the wake of the referendum vote last year to lift a near-total ban on abortion, a landmark in the country\u2019s social liberalisation.\nA total of 66.4% of voters delivered a stinging rebuke to the Roman Catholic church by voting to repeal the eighth amendment to the constitution, which gave \u201cthe unborn\u201d equal rights to pregnant women and made abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest or severe danger to the mother.\nFast-track legislation led to the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act being signed into law on 20 December 2018, paving the way for service rollout this month.\nMost of the state\u2019s 19 maternity units, plus clinics run by other organisations, are expected to start offering abortion services within weeks.\nAbout 20 women reportedly sought terminations on the first working day of the service on Wednesday.\nUnder the new system, GPs will provide abortions to women up to nine weeks pregnant and hospitals will perform terminations at between nine and 12 weeks.\nAfter 12 weeks, abortions will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The service will be largely free, with the state paying GPs approximately \u20ac400 (\u00a3358) per patient.",

Absolutely nothing,\u201d pointing half playfully, half defiantly at the camera before bursting into laughter and flinging herself through the door of her office as if she had occupied her seat on Capitol Hill for years, not 24 hours.\nWith the clip, she wrote: \u201cI hear the GOP [Republican party] thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! Have a great weekend everyone :)\u201d\nThe original short clip from her student days was part of a longer video, made while she was an undergraduate at Boston University. In it, she and several other students dance on the rooftop of a university building to the song Lisztomania by Phoenix, in a mash-up of a dance from the Breakfast Club.\nHere is America\u2019s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is......High School video of \u201cSandy\u201d Ocasio-Cortezpic.twitter.com/s723Vga9zF\nComedian Patton Oswalt joked: \u201cShe\u2019ll never recover from the world seeing her \u2026 (watches video) \u2026 dancing adorably and having fun with her friends in high school?\u201d\nReacting late on Thursday and early Friday to the first video, before Ocasio-Cortez posted her ripostes, the actor Russell Crowe said the dance was \u201cfantastic\u201d. He added: \u201cThe more politicians we have like AOC the sooner we\u2019ll all be dancing.\u201d\nAlly Sheedy, who played Allison Reynolds in The Breakfast Club, and whose dance moves Ocasio-Cortez was imitating, said she was \u201cpretty happy \u2019bout it\u201d, later writing: \u201cI love this #teamAOC.\u201d\nImagine what a major ass-head one would have to be to think that video of @AOC dancing is anything but adorable and  endearing and charming.\nA Twitter account was soon created called \u201cAOC Dances To Every Song\u201d, setting her dance moves to hits such as Kids in America by Kim Wilde and Rebel Rebel by David Bowie.\nThe clips of the young congresswoman getting her groove on have been shared hundreds of thousands of times \u2013 emphasizing how bad politicians normally are at dancing, as highlighted by the British prime minister, Theresa May, and her departed foreign secretary and Brexit nemesis, Boris Johnson.\nSince her election, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly been the target of criticism from the right, including for her clothing choices.\nFox News also attacked her for claiming she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an apartment in Washington DC until her congressional salary started, saying Ocasio-Cortez was stretching the truth about how poor she was when she had $15,000 (\u00a312,000) in savings. Her communications director later confirmed that Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders staffer who earned about $27,000 in 2017, had less than $7,000 in savings.\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s victory in the Democratic primary against incumbent Joe Crowley was one of the biggest upsets of the primary season. Ocasio-Cortez ran on a platform of Medicare for All and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) department. She has already begun a campaign to make climate change a defining issue for Congress.\nShe is also an adept social media user and has 1.74 million followers on Twitter and 1.2 million on Instagram, and regularly engages with them. She posted a video diary on Instagram documenting her first week in Washington.\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s team demonstrated a slightly less deft touch with social media on Thursday, posting a picture on Instagram of his face looming over the phrase \u201cThe wall is coming\u201d, written in the Game of Thrones font.\nThis is the second time this week the president has misappropriated the tagline from the hit television show to refer to his policies. On Wednesday, Trump posted a photograph of himself in a cabinet meeting with a poster on the table reading: \u201cSanctions are coming \u2026 November 5.\u201d\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

        "content": "In the past 10 years, any Premier League attacker who can maintain an A-list run has become a target of La Liga super clubs \u2013 but it would be a terrible idea for the Liverpool striker\nIs English football in danger of losing Mohamed Salah to Real Madrid or Barcelona because he is now simply too good to stay?\nMido certainly thinks so. Yes: that Mido. The same Mido who once issued a formal apology to Middlesbrough fans for being too fat. The same Mido who is, it turns out, a very good pundit these days and who raised a doubly interesting point this week about Salah\u2019s trajectory in this, his second season of outright Premier League supremacy.\nNo doubt there are Liverpool supporters who might question how well-qualified Mido is to talk about these wider matters. But then there is also probably a detailed academic paper to be written on the way the punditry prospects of retired footballers are linked inexorably to the rise and fall of various features of their own background.\nFor two decades the market was dominated by pinched, Scottish-accented Liverpool players of the mid- to late-1980s, a culture maintained to this day by Graeme Souness who approaches each commentary stint in a state of spleen-crippling horror at the decadence of modern life, while also remaining apparently convinced during his on-screen appearances that everyone in the room is secretly laughing at his shoes.\nIn this game of snakes and ladders, otherwise overlooked retired footballers find a second life as \u201cex-Manchester City\u201d or \u201csix seasons at Chelsea\u201d, even though Chelsea weren\u2019t very good at the time. Anyone who played for Alex Ferguson or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, for example, is still deemed a vital and necessary voice.\nNot that this is a bad thing. There may be no obvious reason why, say, Martin Keown should be such a high-profile public figure, but he has become an agreeably intense presence, dispensing his views with an angry, whispering urgency, like the haunted whistleblower in a grimly authentic spy drama who grabs your arm and snarls into your face on a bench in St James\u2019s Park about \u2013 for some reason \u2013 the inherent flaws in zonal marking, before being found strangled in a phone box six hours later.\nAnd so on to Salah and Mido, who has been prominent on the football-opinion circuit in the past year or so. Mido on the radio. Mido having opinions about transfers. For a while this seemed like an anomaly. Wait, you felt like saying, but what does Yakubu think about this? Or Corrado Grabbi?\nExcept, of course, Mido is in his own way riding the Salah train, using his status as the Egyptian football man we in Britain know best. And happily he\u2019s a good pundit too, unafraid to simply say stuff. A while back I heard Mido talking about the way footballers present a part of their own character on the pitch, that a player can be at his best only when he allows some vital, empowering part of his character to be present and visible in his play, and I thought, yeah, Mido, excellent point.\nIt was a point that came back this week as Mido suggested Salah\u2019s move to Spain was now a near-inevitability, that his continuing success will become \u201ca problem\u201d for Liverpool as the super clubs of La Liga look to fill imminent or existing star vacuums.\nMido is right too. Salah would be the obvious candidate for such a role, barring the relocation of the Neymar-industrial complex, a deal that would involve remortgaging the moon and presenting Neymar himself with a sold gold bowler hat handmade by angelic supernatural sex mermaids.\nIt has been the pattern of the past 10 years. Any Premier League attacker who can maintain an A-list run over consecutive seasons tends to become a target. And while Salah was relatively quiet in the defeat by Manchester City on Thursday night, he has been consistently excellent, throwing off his early season rustiness to become even better: more central, more creative and just as prolific.\nAnd yet, this would still be a terrible idea \u2013 and for more reasons than one. Most obviously, is Salah really the right player for all that? He\u2019s not a machine-attacker at the ludicrously sustained levels set by the Messi-Ronaldo godhead for the past 10 years.\nSalah is human, a little in and out at times, and all the more endearing for it. He hasn\u2019t scored a goal against the Premier League top four since April. He is a delicate rather than steamrollering talent, at a club where he has been nurtured in exactly the right way.\nWhy change this? Why expose yourself to that impossible star vacuum? Why run the risk of becoming Messi\u2019s \u201cMoyes\u201d? Salah may or may not be good enough and relentless enough for this. But the fact is the old gal\u00e1ctico system feels a little broken and jaded, another example of the unquestioned idea that \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cambition\u201d \u2013 more, bigger, richer \u2013 is always good, even when we already have quite enough.\nThere are other ways the world can work. Just as the defining note of this Liverpool team isn\u2019t hunger for victory at all costs but its sense of heart and spirit, that fleeing of fraternal collectivism.\nIn part this is to do with J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s ideas about nurture and steady improvement. Salah has been an obvious beneficiary of this human touch, to the extent the idea he must now leave seems not just odd but illogical.\nNo doubt Mido has his own insight into how this might pan out in the cold hard reality. But it doesn\u2019t mean the machine can\u2019t be resisted. Or that success will naturally follow for a player who seems to be in a place where he makes perfect sense, is operating at his own outer limits, and is above all happy.",

It is in our interest, as it is for the UK, to not allow new smugglers to operate which would attract new migrants.\u201d\nThe UK\u2019s home secretary, Sajid Javid, has previously faced criticism for denouncing people trying to cross the Channel as \u201cillegal\u201d migrants without offering evidence of their motivation in making the dangerous journey.\nExperts have also said his threat to make it more difficult to successfully gain asylum in the UK, which he said would act as a deterrent to people thinking of attempting the crossing, would be unlawful.\nThe shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has said the comments were part of a Conservative \u201cobsession with maintaining a hostile environment\u201d.\nJavid said: \u201cI wholeheartedly welcome this action from our French colleagues and it is vital we continue to work together to tackle the situation in the English Channel.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s plan will operate in conjunction with the action that the UK is taking to protect our border and prevent the loss of life. We\u2019ve stepped up our law enforcement response through the NCA and other agencies and earlier this week I announced two Border Force cutters would be returning to the UK from abroad \u2013 with a navy vessel helping with our patrols in the interim.\n\u201cThe UK and French authorities continue to work closely through the new 24/7 Anglo-French coordination centre in Calais and we are developing our joint action plan which will further build on this work. I look forward to finalising it when I meet the French interior minister in the coming weeks.\u201d\nFrance said 71 crossing attempts were recorded last year, compared with 12 in 2017. There were 14 crossing attempts in the first 10 months of the year and 57 in November and December alone. Of the 71 attempts, 40 were successful and 31 failed.\nOf the 504 migrants seeking to cross the Channel in 2018, 276 managed to get to British waters and coasts and 228 were intercepted by the French authorities. Most of the people were Iranian.\nThe increase in attempts to cross by boat is believed to be due to increased security at ferry ports and Eurotunnel.\nCastaner and Javid have spoken in recent days about measures to tackle the situation. Castaner said the UK had agreed to continue providing financial support and technology such as drones, radars and video surveillance.\nThe French minister said: \u201cThe perspective of Brexit does not alter the need for our two countries to strengthen our cooperation to bring in concrete and coordinated measures to fight illegal immigration.\n\u201cThe British commitments show the willingness of the UK to continue participating in the security of our common border.\u201d\nThe UK defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, said on Thursday: \u201cI can confirm that HMS Mersey will deploy to the Dover Straits to assist the UK Border Force and French authorities with their response to migrant crossings.\n\u201cThe professionalism of the Royal Navy means the crew have been able to immediately divert from routine operations to help prevent migrants from making the dangerous journey across the Channel.\u201d\nJavid said the use of HMS Mersey was an interim measure until the cutters arrive back in UK waters from the Mediterranean.",

Efforts to contain the disease have been hampered by continued violence and political instability.\nOn Thursday, director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the outbreak was occurring in \u201cthe most difficult context imaginable\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cTo end it [the outbreak], the response needs to be supported and expanded, not further complicated. Ebola is unforgiving, and disruptions give the virus the advantage.\u201d\nTo date, more than 54,000 people in DRC, including frontline responders and those at risk of having contact with the disease, have been vaccinated.\nFatality rates for Ebola have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe virus spreads from human to human through close contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the disease.\nThe incubation period for Ebola \u2013 the gap between an individual being infected and showing symptoms \u2013 is up to 21 days, meaning it is possible for an infected person to travel widely before realising they have the disease.\nHumans are not infectious until they develop symptoms, which at first are fever, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat.\nThe worst Ebola epidemic ended in West Africa two years ago after killing more than 11,300 people and infecting about 28,600 across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nCases outside of Africa have been isolated. Pauline Cafferkey, a Scottish nurse who volunteered in Sierra Leone in December 2014, was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK.\nShe survived but has since been readmitted to hospital on several occasions.",

        "content": "A hat-trick from Fernando Llorente and two goals from Serge Aurier, the first a thumping drive from distance that Harry Kane could hardly have bettered, saw Tottenham into the FA Cup fourth round at the expense of Tranmere Rovers. The League Two side managed to live with their illustrious opponents for most of the first half but were outclassed after the interval, with Son Heung-min pulling the strings. Kane even took the field with the score at 6-0 and managed to add a seventh before the end, taking his tally for the season to 19 and bringing Spurs a 33rd goal in 33 days as well as their biggest away win ever in the FA Cup.\n\u201cMaybe we are different to everyone else, we always like to be positive,\u201d Mauricio Pochettino said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a risk at all to send Harry on for a few minutes. Strikers like to score goals and he got one. We take all the competitions we are in seriously and I also think you need to show respect to the supporters when you are away from home. Some of the people who paid money to see the game probably did so in the hope they might see Harry Kane in action.\u201d\nSon had a great chance to open the scoring after eight minutes when he raced clear through the middle to take advantage of a deflection from a defender that fell into his path. He had only Scott Davies to beat but shot early and unconvincingly, allowing the goalkeeper to save with his legs. Davies made a rather better save a few minutes later when Connor Jennings lingered too long on the ball in his own half, inviting Juan Foyth to dispossess him with a crunching tackle. The ball again broke kindly for Son, who this time slipped Lucas Moura in to his left, only for the goalkeeper to leave his line quickly to smother the low shot.\nSpurs did not have their very best team with Kane joined on the bench by Moussa Sissoko, Christian Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld. They were in control of the game nonetheless and almost took the lead on the half-hour when Llorente volleyed narrowly over from a corner. Manny Monthe rose to meet a Liam Ridehalgh corner at the other end shortly afterwards, obliging Paulo Gazzaniga to make his first save of the game to prevent the header creeping under the crossbar.\nJust when Rovers must have been thinking they might reach half-time unscathed Aurier put Spurs ahead with an unstoppable screamer from 30 yards out. Aurier had merely been standing in the centre of the pitch to provide notional cover at a Tottenham corner when a series of half-clearances by Tranmere sent the ball his way. He was a long way out but his first-time shot had power and accuracy and arrowed unerringly into Davies\u2019 top-left corner.\nThere was very little chance for Tranmere to do anything to save the game as Tottenham increased their lead almost immediately after the break. Son made one of his irresistible charges to the goalline and might well have shot had not the angle been so narrow. Instead he looked up and picked out Llorente perfectly and the Spanish striker tucked away one of the easier goals of his Spurs career from the six-yard line.\nTranmere did have an opportunity to pull a goal back when the ball broke to Harvey Gilmour a few yards out, though with the goal at his mercy the midfielder put his shot over the bar. Lucas nearly added a third for the visitors when he skipped neatly around Stephen McNulty but tripped himself up in the process of rounding the goalkeeper.\nIt hardly mattered \u2013 Spurs were still four goals up before the hour mark. First Son set up Aurier for his second goal of the evening, a less spectacular effort than the first with the ball only just evading the Tranmere defenders\u2019 efforts to stop it on the line, then Son popped up in space on the left and beat Davies with a low shot rolled into the far corner. When the South Korean was substituted a few minutes later he left the field to applause from all sides of the ground.\nTwo close-range finishes in quick succession from Llorente were harsh on Tranmere, as was the sight of Kane taking the field at 6-0 to replace him and lifting a shot over Davies 10 minutes from time. Ollie Banks had a shot saved and Jake Caprice might have done better with a shooting opportunity but Tranmere were rarely far enough upfield to seek consolation. They were too busy trying to keep the score in single figures.",

        "content": "Sale 24-18 Saracens Faf de Klerk outstanding as hosts get under visitors\u2019 skin\nPerhaps something is beginning to stir at Sale after all. On a night when the Saracens forward Billy Vunipola marked his comeback from injury with a well-taken opening try and played the full 80 minutes it was the hosts who were celebrating a famous, third successive Premiership victory.\nOn New Year\u2019s Day Sale\u2019s embattled director of rugby, Steve Diamond, declared his ambition to compete for trophies again. Putting Saracens, the defending champions, to the sword suggested his desire has substance. Not much has gone right for Sale since their memorable 2006 Premiership final win over Leicester at Twickenham. But this hard-earned victory, chiselled on aggression and two delightful first-half tries, was rapturously received by Diamond and his men.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve beaten the best team in the country and you have to bully them into it sometimes,\u201d Diamond said with a mischievous smile after Sale\u2019s mere second win over Saracens in the last eight years. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been playing well and I embrace the challenge of playing in this competition. I think \u2018can we turn them over?\u2019 and with the players we\u2019ve got, believing in what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re doing all right.\u201d\nVunipola was making his first appearance since breaking his left arm during a European Champions Cup win at Glasgow on 14 October. In the seventh minute he opened the scoring when he collected a pass from Alex Goode and evaded four Sale defenders to touch down in the left corner.\nSale responded with two tries in five minutes midway through the first half. First the homegrown centre Sam James broke from midfield and found Denny Solomona on the right flank before gratefully receiving the winger\u2019s inside pass to scamper clear.\nIt got even better for Sale five minutes later when the scrum-half Faf de Klerk, who beavered away frenziedly all night, seized possession from a lineout. His deft pass found the ubiquitous James who had the presence of mind to return the favour to Solomona racing clear on a diagonal run inside the right channel from around 50 metres out.\nA yellow card for Owen Farrell following a high shot on his England teammate Chris Ashton in the 35th minute added to the belief that it could be the hosts\u2019 night. Tempers flared as the hour approached, with Saracens\u2019 lock George Kruis and the Sale captain, Jono Ross, squaring up in a spat which also involved Richard Wigglesworth, the former Sharks man. It underlined how much the game meant to both sides as chances grew scarce and tensions mounted.\nEmphatic proof that Sale really had got under their visitors\u2019 skin came with 20 minutes remaining. Saracens\u2019 replacement hooker Christopher Tolofua became the second visiting player to be sent to the sin-bin when he caught Arron Reed off the ball. After dissent from Farrell saw him concede a penalty moments later, Du Preez\u2019s boot finished off Saracens amid scenes of euphoria, before Nick Tompkins\u2019 last-minute consolation lifted the visitors top.\nSaracens\u2019 director of rugby, Mark McCall, said: \u201cBilly did quite well but we just got the fundamentals wrong tonight.\u201d",

While the conditions for this FA Cup third-round tie will be a new experience for Unai Emery, the match will also provide continuity as the manager looks to maintain the development of the youngsters in his squad.\nThroughout their campaigns in the Carabao Cup and Europa League, Emery has fielded sides that mix senior squad players with raw talent from the youth teams. The Spaniard intends to do the same on Saturday.\nEight academy prospects have featured for Arsenal this season, one more than in the entirety of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s final campaign. The latest, the 17-year-old winger Bukayo Saka, made an impressive Premier League debut when he came on as a substitute against Fulham on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\u201cThe priority is to take the big performance against each team we are playing,\u201d Emery said of his approach to squad rotation, \u201cbut also to develop young players, for example Saka. He made his debut last match and he was playing because at the moment we don\u2019t have many options in winger right or left. He is in the academy, he is growing up and this is the beginning of, I hope, a long career in Arsenal.\n\u201cIt is the same with Emile [Smith Rowe], with [Joe] Willock, with [Eddie] Nketiah. We need to give them chances but in good combination with other things. On Saturday I am going to do that.\u201d\nEmery went on to explain his thinking more broadly regarding those who have come through the Hale End academy. \u201cI usually work with young players and give them the opportunity to work with us,\u201d he said. \u201cI then give them chances to play but only if we can get the victory. My responsibility is to work with them and here I want to do that. But each player is going to earn in his way more or less chances with his performances and his everyday work.\n\u201cWhen they are playing with Freddie [Ljungberg] in the under-23s we are looking at their performances and their attitude, if it\u2019s OK or not \u2026 and at the moment we are going to continue in this way. We know they can train with us and start playing matches. It is very difficult but we need to help them.\u201d\nAlongside Saka, another teenager likely to feature in the Arsenal lineup against Blackpool is Smith Rowe, who scored when the teams met earlier this season in the Carabao Cup. Emery revealed the 18-year-old will be part of his plans for the rest of the season, with the club likely to refuse offers to take him on loan. \u201cIn the summer there was interest,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now it is not our interest.\u201d",

Fernandinho, who was among City\u2019s finest performers at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday, said: \u201cFour points is going to be interesting for the rest of the season for both teams. They are still leaders and they have a lot of games to play as well. It is not easy to stay at the top because the pressure is so high. You have to win every game, so we will see what happens in the end.\u201d\nThe midfielder pointed to the manner of the victory, in which Leroy San\u00e9 scored the winner after Roberto Firmino had cancelled out Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s opener. \u201cI am so glad because the team started so well,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the beginning of the second half we suffered a little bit and after that, even when they had the ball in possession, we defended so well, we didn\u2019t concede many chances.\n\u201cThis is the best way to play. Whoever wants to be champions has to be able to attack and defend. I think all the big games are like this [tense]. You cannot blink. You get punished, so you have to be careful all the time and everyone who was involved had the same feeling. We had to play our football and try to defend as well as we did, not concede goals.\n\u201cWe had a chance to show our quality after a couple of bad results [defeats to Leicester City and Crystal Palace]. We\u2019re back on track and on winning ways.\n\u201cThe team has been playing good games and this is the most important for us. If you play bad you can win the games, but you have to play good and get the three points. It was a nice game for everybody and of course for the fans. They were so excited, and I am happy for them.\u201d\nOf Sunday\u2019s visit of Rotherham United in the FA Cup third round he added: \u201cWe try to play the same intensity as always. Some teams come to Etihad and don\u2019t want to play with the ball like Liverpool did, so we won\u2019t have to defend like we did. But with the ball we try to play with the same intensity always. We try to find the spaces to create the chances and arrive in the box. When we play games like this we have to try and recover the ball as fast as possible.\u201d",

J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s leaders remain calm, the Croatia international said, despite losing their unbeaten record at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday.\nLiverpool players voiced similar messages after the 2-1 loss to City: disappointment at the outcome of a compelling game but confidence in what their performance away at the reigning champions demonstrated. Lovren claimed the Premier League leaders do not feel the pressure of trying to land Liverpool\u2019s first league title for 29 years, only greater determination to respond with another convincing run.\n\u201cPeople will question us for one game? I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d the defender said. \u201cPeople already questioned us even before the season, then they said the City game is for the title already. It doesn\u2019t work like that in football. It is game by game, let us see at the end of the season where we will finish but I don\u2019t think it will change anything. No, we are quite strong in the mentality.\n\u201cThis is Liverpool \u2013 we will always come back when it\u2019s tough. And you know it is tough after the last whistle but it is over, finished, we can\u2019t change it, so we accept that and congratulate City. But the season is long and I believe in this team.\u201d\nLovren described Liverpool\u2019s changing room as calm after the defeat, with Klopp and his players refusing to be too dispirited at the end of their unbeaten league run and their lead being reduced to four points.\n\u201cThe message was to stay calm,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are many games in front of us and we are still first. Like I said, nothing changed. We need to stay calm, keep our focus and do not look back. When we win or lose, we will not look back. Just like when we have been winning through this season, we keep calm now when we lose. We lose, we stick together and we will continue. We again showed our ability to come back against City but it wasn\u2019t enough this time. We are disappointed but we will keep our nerve. Let\u2019s continue to work.\u201d\nLiverpool won nine consecutive league games before Thursday\u2019s setback. Virgil van Dijk echoed his central defensive partner\u2019s conviction that Klopp\u2019s team will not be unnerved by a first defeat.\n\u201cThere is no reason to panic, only to keep going,\u201d said Van Dijk. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at this situation in a negative way. We are still top of the league, with a four-point lead. It is still looking fine for us. We have a great mentality. We have shown that all season. We just have to keep on doing what we have been doing. There is no reason to change anything or panic.\n\u201cWe put them under pressure, we created good chances, if we scored that first one [Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s shot against the post] it is a completely different game.

The style we\u2019re playing \u2013 [if] it reminds us of Sir Alex\u2019s team. It has to start with the way we play, because results you cannot control. You can control how you approach the game and how you play. And of course trophies. If you can get to the final of the FA Cup and get a trophy [that might be a factor]. Let\u2019s see in May if it\u2019s [my tenure is] a success or not.\u201d\nSolskj\u00e6r believes he is the right man for United despite overseeing Cardiff\u2019s City relegation to the Championship in 2013-14.\n\u201cI did whatever I could at Cardiff but it was not the right fit for me or them,\u201d he said, before pointing to Molde, the club he is due to return to in May for the 2019 season in Norway. \u201cThat\u2019s just how football is. Molde fits me very well, Man United fits me very well, because it\u2019s in me. It\u2019s in your personality, it\u2019s ingrained in you. I understand the club. I thought I could go into Cardiff but different clubs have different cultures, different playing styles and philosophies.\u201d\nAfter playing Reading Solskj\u00e6r takes United to Dubai for a week of warm-weather training, before the trip to Tottenham next Sunday.\n\u201cWe can get fitter and we have to do that through the training sessions here but Dubai is a good chance because now is the first time we get a week of work together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones who have not been in the squad have worked on their fitness. I still have pictures in my mind every January the gaffer [Ferguson] with the stopwatch and he\u2019s timing us \u2013 all those runs we did. That stood us in good stead towards the end of the season, so it is a time to work hard even though we\u2019ve got plenty of games, we need to work.\u201d\nSolskj\u00e6r is yet to have any discussions regarding signings in the transfer window. \u201cI\u2019m happy with squad I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anyone to come in but if the club have targeted and identified a few and I think they might fit here I\u2019ll give my thumbs up but it\u2019s not just my decision.\u201d\nPaul Pogba is expected to miss Reading\u2019s visit because of a knock, while Romelu Lukaku and Alexis S\u00e1nchez will start.",

Research has found that a quarter of smartphone users never use them to make a voice call.\n\u201cCalling someone is a bit daunting,\u201d said one 18-year-old respondent in a survey on phone habits conducted by Ofcom. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier and quicker to WhatsApp my friends. If I have to call a company, I\u2019ll always try to use webchat if it\u2019s available.\u201d\nLast year, Ofcom found the average Briton checked their mobile phone every 12 minutes. It also found that, for the first time, the time spent making phone calls from mobiles fell, as users instead used messaging services instead.\nIn 2017, BT said it would scrap half of the UK\u2019s remaining phone boxes \u2013 about 20,000 \u2013 after usage fell by 90% over the previous decade. BT found that while approximately 33,000 calls a day were still being made from phone boxes in 2017, about a third were only used once a month, and many were never used at all. At their peak there were 92,000 pay phones across the UK.",

The filing also cites an article, in which a reporter characterized Banks calling Musk a caveman as \u201cvaguely eugenicist\u201d, as further evidence of her untrustworthiness. \n  Kristy also invoked a tale resurfaced recently by Vanity Fair that Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, once sent Banks hair clippings to make him a protective amulet.\n\u201cThis is simply not the type of witness, or factual record, that could justify the required finding of exceptional circumstances necessary\u201d to allow the subpoenas, the filing argues.\nBanks appears to have taken exception to Kristy\u2019s filing, an excerpt of which she posted as a screenshot in her now-deleted Instagram post.\n\u201cI\u2019m now even more angered by the fact that his lawyer is falsely stating I lied after being vindicated in both incidents with Russell Crowe and Jack Dorsey,\u201d she wrote.\nNeither Banks nor Musk responded immediately to requests for comment.",

He has said his decision to arrange to meet a woman on a sugar baby website was a \u201cdumb mistake\u201d.\nThe Mallee preselection field includes Irymple airconditioning businessman Toby Heil, Birchip farmer Bernadette Hogan, Mildura acting police inspector Paul Mathieson, Mallee Sustainable Farming executive chairman Daniel Linklater and Minyip farmer Shane McGrath. McGrath is the son of the late former Victorian state MP Bill McGrath.\nMildura social worker Anne Webster, who previously ran against Broad in 2013 for preselection, is also in contention.\nWebster, 59, founded a community organisation called Zoe Support, which helps mothers in their teens and early 20s reconnect with studying and training. She has lived in Mildura for 41 years and is married to a local doctor.\nShe recently completed her PhD in sociology on adoption at the Australian National University, and said her six grandchildren were used to her trundling off to Canberra for her studies.\n\u201cI think there is significant distrust in politicians and politics more broadly,\u201d she said.\nWebster spent the last week travelling around Wimmera towns rallying support among National party members. \u201cThere is a feeling of great disappointment,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to understand the difference between a person\u2019s actions and the party\u2019s attitudes, goals and values. The National party continues to be the way forward for regional and rural Australia.\u201d\nShe nominated road upgrades, lack of rail services, water, energy, healthcare, education and immigration as key issues in the seat.\nThe region was hoping to attract more refugees to struggling small towns to help fill unskilled job shortages, she said, highlighting the success of the Burmese Karen who have settled in Nhill.\nHundreds of National party members will make a decision on the Mallee candidate on 19 January.\nSenior party officials are supporting the push for a female candidate.\nThe National party state director, Matthew Harris, acknowledged that while a female candidate would be a good thing, it was not set in stone.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s up to the membership in Mallee,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll vote for whoever they think is the best candidate.\u201d\nWhile Broad holds the seat of Mallee on a margin of about 20%, the Nationals could face a tough battle to retain it.\nIn a surprise upset during the November Victorian election, the independent Ali Cupper wrested the previously safe state seat of Mildura from Nationals MP Peter Crisp.\nCupper believes there is strong local anger about a lack of resources and infrastructure after decades of being taken for granted.\nShe said there could be fertile ground for a strong independent candidate to rise.\nThe former Yarriambiak mayor Ray Kingston has announced a bid to run as an independent.\nThe Liberal party is also likely to run a candidate in the seat of Mallee. One of the names being bandied about is Peta Credlin, Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff turned Sky News presenter, who grew up in the town of Wycheproof.",

        "content": "A scrupulous study of the squabble between Germany and Israel over Kafka\u2019s papers, and the two women caught in the middle\nThe world was Kafkaesque before Franz Kafka; all he did was contribute the adjective. He was certainly not the first literary artist to identify the essential uncanniness of quotidian reality. From Catullus through Jonathan Swift and on to Heinrich von Kleist, ETA Hoffmann and Dostoevsky, the fictions we spin in order that life might be sustainable have been questioned, derided and upended, over and over. All the same, Kafka remains a special case. As George Steiner pointed out, no other great writer, not even Shakespeare, managed to arrogate to himself and make uniquely his own a letter of the alphabet. In the darker realm of literature, at least, K is king.\nThe adjective \u201cKafkaesque\u201d has, of course, become a cliche. Kafka\u2019s name, according to Philip Roth, \u201cis plastered indiscriminately on almost any baffling or unusually opaque event that is not easily translatable into the going simplifications\u201d. Even Max Brod, his friend and the man we must thank for disregarding Kafka\u2019s specific, written instructions that all his unpublished work should be destroyed, protested against the \u201crepulsive expression \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019\u201d, adding that \u201cKafkaesque is that which Kafka was not!\u201d But neither was he what Brod claimed him to be, a \u201csaint of our time\u201d.\nAnd Theodor Adorno was right to insist that he was not \u201ca poet of the Judaic homeland\u201d. Indeed, one of the themes running throughout Benjamin Balint\u2019s fascinating and forensically scrupulous account of the history of Kafka\u2019s papers is the writer\u2019s deeply ambiguous relationship \u2013 if it can even be called that \u2013 with Israel, or, as it still was in his time, Palestine. While Brod, a typical Mitteleuropean man of letters, \u201ccame,\u201d according to the journalist and Zionist Robert Weltsch, \u201cto complete identification with the Jewish people\u201d, Kafka maintained a sceptical attitude on the \u201cJewish question\u201d, both in the personal and the public spheres. \u201cWhat have I in common with the Jews?\u201d he asks in his diary, adding with typically lugubrious humour, \u201cI have hardly anything in common with myself.\u201d\nIt was not until he discovered what Balint describes as \u201can unlikely source of vitality\u201d in the performances of a Yiddish theatre troupe in Prague\u2019s Cafe Savoy that he began to appreciate his Jewish inheritance. \u201cThe caf\u00e9 was tawdry,\u201d Balint writes, \u201cits doorman a part-time pimp,\u201d yet the burlesque performances had the peculiar effect of making Kafka\u2019s \u201ccheeks tremble\u201d.\nKafka filled more than a 100 pages of his diary, Balint tells us, with accounts of the Yiddish players and their plays. \u201cHe was impressed by their authenticity and \u2018vigour\u2019 (Urw\u00fcchsigkeit), and by the ironic idiom itself \u2013 in which high and low, biblical and vernacular rattled against each other.\u201d Samuel Beckett must have undergone the same kind of Damascene moment when he first began to look seriously at the miniature tragicomic epics of Buster Keaton.\nWhether his glimpse of a shared Jewish past turned Kafka into a \u201cJewish\u201d writer is doubtful. True, he did teach himself Hebrew, as his friend Georg Langer, a scholar of the Kabbalah, attested: \u201cHe, who always insisted that he was not a Zionist, learned our language at an advanced age and with great diligence.\u201d Yet as Kafka himself wrote not long before his death: \u201cWhat is Hebrew, but news from far away?\u201d As to Palestine itself, it seems to have been for Kafka not so much the promised as the improbable land. As he scathingly remarked: \u201cMany people prowl around Mt Sinai.\u201d Perhaps the matter is best expressed by the Swiss critic Jean Starobinski: \u201cIn the face of Judaism, Kafka is an exile, albeit one who ceaselessly asks for news of the land he has left.\u201d\nAll these aspects of the extremely vexed Jewish question are pertinent to Balint\u2019s subject, which is the battle between Germany and Israel for possession of Kafka\u2019s literary remains, and the plight of the two women caught in the crossfire \u2013 although it must be acknowledged that Esther Hoffe and her daughter Eva exploded quite a few bombs themselves.\nThe Israeli case was succinctly stated by Meir Heller, the hard-nosed lawyer who through eight years of intricate, sometimes bitter, and \u2013 yes, alas \u2013 Kafkaesque litigation represented the National Library of Israel: \u201cLike many other Jews who contributed to western civilisation, we think, his legacy ... [and] his manuscripts should be placed here in the Jewish state.\u201d\nThe other interested party was the German Literature Archive at Marbach, under the direction of Ulrich Raulff, which, as Balint writes, \u201cwished to add Kafka\u2019s manuscripts to the estates of more than 1,400 writers \u2026 held in storage facilities kept at a constant 18C\u201319C (about 66F) and a relative humidity of 50 percent-55 percent\u201d. So far, so German; one of the less temperate comments came from the publisher and Kafka scholar Klaus Wagenbach: \u201cThe Israelis seem to have become crazed.\u201d\nThe squabble \u2013 and it was a squabble, despite the many high-minded pronouncements that the affair called forth \u2013 centred not on Kafka himself, or his wishes as to the fate of his papers, running to tens of thousands of pages, but to the ambiguities of the will left behind by Brod, the original keeper of the archive. A tireless, prolific and for the most part mediocre writer and journalist, Brod was Kafka\u2019s closest friend and confidant, and regarded him with, as he confessed, \u201cfanatical veneration\u201d, finding even his chronic hypochondria \u201cinventive and entertaining\u201d.\nAfter the second world war, Brod settled in Palestine, not without doubts and difficulties, and with less of an enthusiastic reception than he might justifiably have expected. In Israel\u2019s defence, the new state was more in need of people of action than of another central European intellectual, even one carrying a bulging suitcase of papers left behind by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, indeed of all the centuries.\nKafka had entrusted his archive to Brod with instructions to destroy it, instructions that Brod insisted he assured Kafka he had no intention of carrying out. In Tel Aviv, Brod became friends with another German exile, Otto Hoffe, and his much younger wife, Esther. Brod, whose own wife had recently died and whose lover had left him, latched on to the Hoffes, and in time took on Esther as his secretary, and perhaps more \u2013 although Esther\u2019s daughter Eva insisted that Esther\u2019s relation to Brod \u201cwasn\u2019t carnal, it was spiritual\u201d.\nWhatever the nature of the connection between the two, on his death in 1968 Brod left Esther in possession of the great bulk of Kafka\u2019s papers, including original manuscripts of novels and stories, and a wealth of correspondence. Balint, who is a library fellow at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem, emphasises that for decades the Israeli state showed no interest in securing the papers, and did not even react when Esther put some manuscripts up for auction.\nIn time, Esther left what remained of them \u2013 a substantial haul, despite those auctions \u2013 to Eva, still living in Tel Aviv. At once Israel, in the form of its National Library, moved to contest Esther\u2019s will, provoking the Marbach Literature Archive to weigh in with its own case. Since it had already been in negotiation with Esther to buy Brod\u2019s estate, including the Kafka papers, the archive\u2019s director held that it had the right at least to make a bid against the Israeli claim. There followed no fewer than three trials in Israel, which ended with the supreme court\u2019s decision that Eva must hand over, without recompense, the entire Brod papers, including Kafka\u2019s legacy, to the library.\nWho was in the right, or could there even be a \u201cright\u201d decision in such a case, involving the claims of the Jewish state against a nation that had permitted the murder of 6 million Jews? The real loser was not the Marbach archive, for all the affront it suffered, but Eva, who died in August 2018. Balint, in a passage that Kafka would surely have admired, sums up the matter eloquently and movingly when he writes: \u201cLike the man from the country in Kafka\u2019s parable \u2018Before the Law\u2019, Eva Hoffe remained stranded and confounded outside the door of the law \u2026 Her inheritance was the trial itself. Paradoxically, she had inherited her disinheritance, inherited the impossibility of carrying out her mother\u2019s will. She possessed only her dispossession.\u201d\n Kafka\u2019s Last Trial is published by Picador. To order a copy for \u00a313.19 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

        "content": "All day it felt like the storm was closing in. A clear morning gave way to violent buffets of wind. The flags over the Members Pavilion stood out so stiff they could have been cardboard. The clouds overhead increased layer by layer, until the air itself grew so thick that you felt like dipping a slice of bread in it.\nAll around Sydney, blotches of yellow and orange into deep dried-blood red clustered over the rain radar, from Hornsby to Mosman, over Homebush and Bankstown. Somehow for hours the Sydney Cricket Ground stayed safely in a decreasing dry centre.\nThe morning sun had shone as blithely and brightly as Australia\u2019s hopes of offering meaningful resistance. As briefly, too. This struggling team hasn\u2019t won a lot of sessions this series. Adding 98 runs for the loss of only Usman Khawaja was a win. Marcus Harris was entertaining the crowd, and after a calendar year bereft of Test centuries, it looked like 2019 would start with one.\nAt the other end was Marnus Labuschagne, the highly contentious newcomer to the side who was batting at first drop, producing a couple of classy shots and some solid defence.\nBut this summer the clouds have never been far away. \u201cI thought this would be Australia\u2019s day with the bat,\u201d said former Australia batsman Ed Cowan alter on ABC radio. \u201cIt was the day when they could make the mental breakthrough. Two fast bowlers on a placid pitch. It was on a plate. It was on a plate for the top six today to make a statement.\u201d\nHarris had the best chance. But on 79, having put on 56 with Labuschagne, he cut at a Ravindra Jadeja ball that was far too full, edging back onto his stumps. India\u2019s seamers, meanwhile, had noticed Labuschagne playing across his front pad. Mohammad Shami kept bowling straight. Two midwickets waited for a snaffle. On 38, Labuschagne middled it straight into the leg-side trap.\nThat made three tame dismissals, and two catches at midwicket, after Khawaja had galloped down at the left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav. Not for the first time this summer, he carried through with a lofted shot despite failing to reach the pitch of the ball. Three for 144, responding to India\u2019s declared innings of 622, and the slide was on again.\nTravis Head advanced as well, only to tamely slot a Kuldeep full toss straight back into the bowler\u2019s hands on 20. Shaun Marsh propped forward to edge an innocuous straight ball from Jadeja to slip, notching yet another single-figure score. Tim Paine aimed a booming drive at a spinner who turns the ball sharply into the right-hander, leaving a gate swinging open in the wind for Kuldeep to drive straight through.\nThe string of middling-to-good scores that never became truly substantial is the story of the series. Never before over four Tests has Australia had more batsmen dismissed between facing 30 and 100 balls. You can find the significance in that, with a slight Magic Eye squint: previously batsmen who haven\u2019t been out early have strapped in for a long stay. When captain Paine complained of bowling on flat pitches, his predecessor Ricky Ponting fired back. \u201cIf they\u2019re flat, get some runs on them.\u201d\nAs so often this past year, Patrick Cummins at number eight showed the shortcomings of his top-order colleagues: defending most balls, then nailing the right candidates along the ground through cover, along the ground on the straight drive, along the ground sweeping, and only going aerial when pulling a short ball to an unattended midwicket.\nAs he batted on with Peter Handscomb, floodlights blazed and the storm grew closer. Security guards ringed the boundary, smothered in the ripple of clear plastic ponchos as though angry jellyfish had been roused to leave the sea. The previous evening, Rishabh Pant had smashed the bowling around in the hard bright light of an Australian summer. It\u2019s a light that leaves nowhere to hide. But when the home team batted a day later the weather surrounded them, threatening, suffocating. That\u2019s how it has felt this series. Like the rain that ended play, the fall has only ever been a matter of time.",

One that costs more than a tenner, too. But please stay with me. I\u2019ve long since advocated the use of scrunchies \u2013 awful, Sloaney, fabric-covered hair accessories now worn ironically by hipsters \u2013 to preserve volume without washing and blowdrying from scratch. The pretty failsafe technique is to spray dry shampoo into your roots at bedtime, leave well alone (that is, without massaging in or brushing through), then pile your hair into a ludicrous-looking pineapple formation and secure with a scrunchie overnight. In the morning, simply work through with your fingers or a brush, and boom: bulk and volume.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nExcept there\u2019s one flaw for the fine- or straight-haired: a visible crease where the scrunchie\u2019s elastic indents the hair \u2013 one that cannot be ironed out without undoing the good work. No more. When I first saw Slip\u2019s Pure Silk Scrunchie, at a whopping \u00a339 for three, my eyes rolled into the back of my puny-haired head. A saggy, prissy-looking ring of fabric-covered elastic is a tough enough sell, never mind when it\u2019s marketed as a covetable, luxury lifestyle item. But my word, these are life-changing. So much so that when I lost mine on a trip to Ireland, I went looking for an immediate replacement. These babies (available in several colours and two widths) leave no marks, give superior volume and, being silk, cause zero static. I expected the slippery fabric to affect its stability and security in the hair but, inexplicably, the opposite is true. The Slip scrunchie stays in all day, even wound round only a couple of times, and its thinness makes it easily concealable under cuffs for periods in between.\nIf those life-changing Slips are too dear for you, there\u2019s the Invisibobble \u2018Sprunchie\u2019 (\u00a35.99), which has the considerable bonus of being available in leopardprint. It would work as well on curly or wavy hair, but I\u2019d discount it for very fine strands, because the velvety fabric caused static in my flyaways.\nIn either case, my dry shampoo recommendation is not to bother with any product over a tenner, and stick with brands such as Batiste (\u00a32.99, 200ml), Klorane (\u00a39, 150ml) and Colab (\u00a33.49, 200ml). In my experience, dry shampoo is much like crisps and chocolate: posh is never as good.",

        "content": "A web of rules, motivations and etiquette governs the trade in temporary solutions that will again dominate this month\nIt is a time of year to beg, borrow and steal in the football world, especially in England, where the January transfer window is again expected to be dominated by loan deals. Only 37 of the 178 players leaving Premier League clubs last January moved permanently and close to one in every three of the incoming signings in the top flight \u2013 a ratio that for the second successive year was twice as high as in the summer \u2013 joined on a temporary basis.\nHalfway through the season is normally short-term fix territory rather than a buyer\u2019s market, which partly explains the prevalence of loans. Yet arguably the biggest factor is the sheer number of professionals that Premier League clubs have on their books these days and the need to find regular first-team football for as many as possible while recouping a bit of money at the same time.\nSome players will be high-profile and out of favour \u2013 see Jermain Defoe, who has just joined Rangers on loan from Bournemouth; Liverpool\u2019s Nathaniel Clyne, who has signed for Eddie Howe\u2019s side until the end of the season; and Chelsea\u2019s Gary Cahill. The majority, though, will be younger players who are some way off the first team and are, in the eyes of senior figures at their clubs, neither developing in a competitive environment by playing under-23 football nor increasing their value. Playing in the EFL ticks both boxes, potentially.\nA spotlight shines on Chelsea for good reason when it comes to this sort of story, but a trawl through last January\u2019s loan deals reveals that Brighton, Newcastle and Watford sanctioned more departures \u2013 double figures in each case \u2013 than anyone else. Chelsea, of course, already had plenty of players farmed out from the summer but the bottom line is that more and more top-flight clubs are adopting a proactive approach when it comes to the loan market.\nYet despite loans being so commonplace now, the framework of the deal remains loose, right down to fundamental details such as exactly what \u201cuntil the end of the season\u201d means. That aspect of a loan \u2013 the finishing point \u2013 is an area of negotiation with almost every deal given that player contracts run until 30 June and the last game of the season is usually at least six weeks earlier. At the top end that could equate to another \u00a3500,000, which is a lot of money to pay somebody else\u2019s employee to sit on the beach.\nIt may be surprising to learn that some players not only get their wages covered in full by the club they are joining but also receive a substantial sum on top. In fact, the complaints of one Premier League player about all the time he had spent on loan earlier in his career raised a few eyebrows within his former club, given that at one stage he was happily picking up an additional five-figure sum every week, on top of his basic wage, for playing in the Championship.\nWith more sought-after players the parent club will always expect wages to be paid in their entirety. In some cases there will also be a one-off loan fee \u2013 incredibly, an eight-figure sum was quoted for one out-of-favour former England international in the summer \u2013 as well as add-ons in the event of a player helping a club avoid relegation or win promotion.\nThat extra outlay is a price worth paying if everything comes off \u2013 Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s impact at Fulham last season is a case in point. The key word in that sentence, however, is \u201cif\u201d. This time last year West Brom took Daniel Sturridge on loan in the hope that he would score the goals to keep them up but because of injury they got only 116 minutes of football out of the Liverpool striker in exchange for \u00a33.8m. On that same theme Crystal Palace had some fitness concerns in relation to Dominic Solanke and pulled out of signing the forward this week because Liverpool were against the idea of linking part of the loan fee to appearances.\nWhile Sturridge\u2019s lack of game-time at West Brom was unavoidable, clubs take a dim view of managers who rarely pick a loan player. Arsenal were unimpressed when Serge Gnabry, now at Bayern Munich, played only 12 minutes of Premier League football under Tony Pulis at West Brom a few years ago, and that sort of experience inevitably colours the response when the same club picks up the phone the following season asking for another player. One way that parent clubs try to protect themselves in that scenario is by inserting financial penalties into loan agreements requiring the other party to pay a higher proportion of wages if the player fails to make a certain number of appearances.\nWhile a team\u2019s playing style and the manager\u2019s reputation are important considerations when loaning out younger players, contacts make a big difference too. Frank Lampard, Derby\u2019s manager, has two Chelsea loanees and would take a third \u2013 four from one club is the maximum in the EFL \u2013 if Maurizio Sarri agreed to allow Ethan Ampadu out. That is understood to be unlikely as things stand.\nLoan rules differ in the Premier League, where only one player from the same club is permitted at a time. Clubs are also allowed a maximum of only two domestic loans at a time. Yet there is no limit on international loans, which means a struggling Premier League club can transform its starting XI in January without making a permanent signing. Two years ago Hull brought five players in on loan and almost survived.\nBusiness has already been brisk this time around and, as the days tick by, it will be interesting to see what becomes of players such as Everton\u2019s Morgan Schneiderlin, Vincent Janssen at Spurs, Leicester\u2019s Adrien Silva, Divock Origi at Liverpool and Chelsea\u2019s Danny Drinkwater, all of whom cost a fair few quid and could do with a new home \u2013 temporary or otherwise \u2013 to revive their careers.",

        "content": "Christmas is fading from memory, but credit card bills will not go away so easily\nDid you blow your budget in December? In a few days\u2019 time, the first set of post-Christmas credit card bills will land on doormats \u2013 and for many they will not make pleasant reading.\nThe average Christmas credit card bill is estimated to be \u00a3323 which, when added to existing debt, means a typical Briton has started 2019 owing about \u00a3740 on their credit card, according to price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.\nIf you are in serious financial difficulty, then seek free advice from an organisation such as National Debtline as soon as possible. However, if your situation is not so dire \u2013 perhaps your plastic took a pounding in the run-up to Christmas or you splurged in the sales \u2013 there are things you can do to get your finances on to a better footing.\nMany people with existing credit and store card debt could save hundreds of pounds or more by transferring these balances to another provider offering a better rate.\nNot surprisingly, the start of the year is usually the most popular time for switching card balances. Last January was the busiest in 12 years, with \u00a31.63bn switched in 31 days, according to TotallyMoney.\nThis is traditionally a very competitive market, although providers seem to be reining in their generosity a little. A year ago, you could get balance transfer deals offering 0% interest for up to 38 months, but the longest period available now is 33 months, says the financial research firm Defaqto.\nThe main benefit of a 0% deal is that all of your monthly repayment goes towards clearing the outstanding balance, and therefore the debt can be cleared much more quickly \u2013 but you do need to be disciplined. Also be aware that there will often be a fee to pay, which is typically a small percentage of the amount of debt being moved over.\nMBNA is offering 0% interest for 33 months on balance transfers, where the fee is 1.99% \u2013 that is, \u00a319.90 per \u00a31,000 transferred. Similarly, Post Office Money is offering 0% for up to 32 months, with a 2% fee.\nNot all deals involve paying a balance transfer fee. For example, Santander has a card offering 0% for 27 months with no fee.\nIf you take the average credit card debt of \u00a32,663, someone who transferred this to a 0% balance transfer card with an interest-free period of 27 months and then repaid \u00a3100 a month, so that their debt is paid off within the interest-free period, would typically save \u00a3880 in total, according to the website GoCompare.\nBut woe betide you if you are late with a monthly payment or otherwise breach the terms of the deal. And not everyone who applies will be offered the advertised rate \u2013 some will be offered less favourable terms.\nIf you are not getting a good deal, think about switching. Authorised overdraft costs vary hugely: some banks impose daily fees, some impose monthly charges, some charge interest, and some use a combination of these.\nThe good news is that a radical shake-up of the way banks charge for overdrafts is on its way. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s plan is that the current plethora of fees and costs will be swept away and replaced by a simple, single interest rate. However, the new rules are not due to come into force until December.\nIn the meantime, many banks have overdraft calculators on their websites, so log on and compare what you would be charged at other institutions.\nTake the example of a standard current account-holder who borrows \u00a3500 on an authorised overdraft over seven days. If they are a NatWest customer, they will be charged \u00a37.75 (\u00a36 monthly fee and \u00a31.75 interest). App-based bank Monzo will charge them \u00a33.50 (50p a day). Meanwhile, if they are a Barclays customer, it\u2019s \u00a35.25 (75p a day up to \u00a31,000). However, if they are a Nationwide customer and hold its FlexAccount, it will be a lot less: \u00a31.67 in interest. And a First Direct customer pays just 71p in interest.\nIf you are juggling various costly debts such as store card and credit card borrowing, you may be able to save money by consolidating them into one cheaper personal loan, where the monthly repayments remain unchanged and the debt is guaranteed to be gone by the end of the term. This is not an answer for everyone, but for some people it will work.\nThere are best-buy personal loan deals available at less than 3% from the likes of M&S Bank, Cahoot (a division of Santander), Clydesdale Bank and Zopa. However, only applicants with a clean credit record are likely to get these headline-grabbing rates.\nThis week, HSBC kicked off this year\u2019s battle for bank account customers by offering up to \u00a3150 in cash in an attempt to persuade people to move to it using the free-to-use \u201ccurrent account switch service\u201d. You can pocket \u00a3150 if you sign up for HSBC\u2019s Advance Bank Account, or \u00a375 if you opt for the Bank Account. Meanwhile, First Direct is currently offering switchers \u00a3100 cash and a \u00a3250 interest-free overdraft as standard.\nIf you keep your current account in credit and rarely, or never, dip into the red, you will probably be looking for a good in-credit interest rate.\nNationwide\u2019s FlexDirect pays 5% AER on balances of up to \u00a32,500 for the first 12 months, and 1% after that. TSB\u2019s Classic Plus account pays the same rate on balances up to \u00a31,500, while Tesco Bank\u2019s current account offers 3% AER on balances up to \u00a33,000. In all cases, terms and conditions apply.",

From 25 October 2021, it will expand to an area bounded by the north and south circular roads.\nVehicles, including motorbikes, that don\u2019t meet the tighter exhaust emissions standards will have to pay \u00a312.50 every day that they are used within the ULEZ \u2013 the city centre one from this April, the bigger one from October 2021 \u2013 plus the \u00a311.50 congestion charge if they enter the city centre between Monday and Friday, 7am to 6pm. Failure to pay will result in a fine of \u00a3160. Lorries will be charged \u00a3100 a day, with a \u00a31,000 fine for failing to pay on time.\nBroadly speaking, pre-2015 diesels and pre-2006 petrol cars will fall foul of the new standards. To find out if your car or bike is affected, go to the \u201cCheck your vehicle\u201d page on the TfL website. So far, 1.3 million people have checked to see if they comply with the ULEZ standards.\nYes, to a degree. London\u2019s 21,000 black cabs are among its dirtiest vehicles, diesels that pump out 16% of all transport nitrous oxide (NOx) in central London. Yet this powerful lobby group have been given an exemption, unlike London\u2019s police cars, ambulances and fire engines, many of which will have to be replaced to meet the new standards.\nTfL says that all new taxis must be zero-emission, but existing ones \u2013 even a diesel bought in 2017 \u2013 can run for up to 15 years without being subject to the charge.\nYes. Keepers of vehicles registered with a \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cdisabled passenger vehicles\u201d tax class will benefit from a \u201csunset period\u201d after the ULEZ starts, meaning they won\u2019t have to pay until 26 October 2025.\nTfL has about 1,000 cameras for the congestion charge zone, but the expanded ULEZ will be 18 times bigger. Quite how small hops within the expanded zone will be monitored is not yet clear. TfL has not said how many more cameras will be put in place, but it may use \u201cexisting infrastructure and transportable cameras\u201d. It will be interesting to see if this includes the ANPR cameras that currently exist on many buses to catch cars wrongly using bus lanes.\n7. Will there be a scrappage scheme for older vehicles?\nYes, but only for small businesses using dirty vans. Just before Christmas the mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a \u00a323m scrappage scheme for businesses with 10 or fewer employees to switch to cleaner vehicles. Khan now wants the government to step up and fund an extension of the scrappage scheme to low income households.\nYes \u2013 but for a limited time only. If your vehicle is registered for the residents\u2019 C-charge discount you will get a 100% discount off the ULEZ charge until 24 October 2021.\nThere will be no barriers or toll booths. Cameras will read number plates and check if the vehicle meets the ULEZ standards. TfL is erecting hundreds of road signs warning motorists of the start of the ULEZ at the current congestion charge zone.\nThe ULEZ charges will be enforced based on the declared emissions of the vehicle rather than the age, although a rule of thumb is that it affects diesels made before 2015 and petrol cars before 2006.\nPetrol cars must meet the Euro 4 standard on emissions to drive into the ULEZ, while diesels must meet Euro 6. Motorcycles and mopeds must meet the Euro 3 standard. For diesels, the Euro 6 standard sets a maximum NOx emission at 80mg/km, compared with the 180mg/km level that was required for cars that met the previous Euro 5 emissions standard. This is why so many diesels, even relatively new ones, will fail the ULEZ test.\nNo. TfL says the use of Euro standards will not be affected in the short to medium term by Brexit as manufacturers will still make vehicles to the same standards and with the same classifications.\nTfL is forecasting a cut of 5% in overall car traffic in central London once the ULEZ comes into force. The congestion charge zone, introduced 15 years ago, has resulted in 30% fewer private vehicles entering the city centre. But that has been offset by a rise in Uber and other private hire vehicles, from 4,000 a day to 18,000. They currently don\u2019t have to pay the congestion charge, but will have to do so from 8 April 2019.",

        "content": "London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone launches in April. It will cut pollution, but some argue it could price motorists off the roads\nULEZ: what you need to know\nIs the zone a good or a bad idea?\nThis April will see the start of what the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, proclaims will be the toughest emissions standards for vehicles in any world city. Will it be a historic turning point in the battle against filthy air in our cities \u2013 or will it prompt \u201cyellow vest\u201d style protests from furious drivers?\nMany motorists are unaware of how strict \u2013 and expensive \u2013 the new rules are for the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ), which starts on 8 April this year. Diesel cars manufactured before 2015 are likely to fall foul of the rules, as well as most pre-2006 petrol cars. They will be charged \u00a312.50 to come into central London at any time, on top of the \u00a311.50 congestion charge, which operates from Monday to Friday 7am to 6pm.\nThen from October 2021 the zone will be hugely expanded, with mums and dads on the school run potentially affected, as 3.6 million London residents are brought into the scheme. Any cars failing to meet the standards by then will have to pay \u00a312.50 a day if they are driven anywhere in an area bounded by the city\u2019s north and south circular roads.\nPrecisely how many drivers will be hit with the charge are unknown, as many are likely to sell older vehicles before 2021. Transport for London says there are about 1.15m vehicles currently registered in the expanded ULEZ.\nIt says: \u201cWhen the zone expands to the north and south circular in 2021 we estimate that 80% of car kilometres driven within the zone, on an average day, would be by cars that already meet the ULEZ standard.\u201d It adds that 90% of motorcycles are likely to be compliant by 2021.\nBut that still leaves at least 100,000 cars or more paying the charge \u2013 which critics are calling a new \u201cpoll tax\u201d on Londoners that they claim will rake in as much as \u00a3750m to \u00a31.5bn from hard-pressed motorists. But TfL says the expected impact will be much less \u2013 it projects that in 2019-20, the first year of the ULEZ, revenue will be \u00a3174m and costs \u00a347m, producing a surplus of \u00a3127m.\nIn 2021, when the greatly expanded zone comes into force, TfL is projecting annual revenue to jump to \u00a3222m, but costs will also rise as a new generation of enforcement cameras are installed. It estimates costs in 2021-22 will be \u00a3125m, so the surplus will fall to \u00a397m.\nThe battle to bring healthy air to city residents is not just in London. In 2020 Birmingham is planning to introduce pollution charges on cars driving within the city\u2019s ring road, with a \u00a36 to \u00a310 fee mooted. In Leeds there are radical plans to charge the most polluting vehicles up to \u00a350 a day to enter a new clean air zone from January 2020. Meanwhile, Bath has plans to charge many motorists \u00a39 a day to drive into its Georgian streets, but the proposals have provoked anger and resentment.\nThe idea behind London\u2019s ULEZ is a determination to clean up the city\u2019s filthy air \u2013 widely regarded as the dirtiest of any major city in Europe. At least 360 primary schools in the capital are in areas exceeding safe legal pollution levels, half of which comes from cars, lorries and buses.\nTfL expects that after just the first year of the ULEZ, harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in central London will reduce by 45%, and 40% in the surrounding areas. It says: \u201cThe expansion of the ULEZ to the north and south circulars will deliver a further 20% reduction across London. This is the next step in the mayor of London\u2019s ultimate goal of creating a zero emissions from road transport by 2050.\u201d\nBut expansion of the zone to cover far greater parts of London, and the speed of its implementation, has provoked a fierce backlash from some. An analysis of submissions to the consultation document found that 56% either supported or strongly supported the expansion of the ULEZ, but 40% were opposed or strongly opposed.\nThousands signed an open letter from the Healthy Air campaign, which said: \u201cI strongly welcome the mayor\u2019s commitment to tackling London\u2019s illegal and harmful levels of air pollution. Road transport is a major source of air pollution and we need urgent action to tackle this.\u201d\nFriends of the Earth went further, calling for a bigger ULEZ, and sooner. It said: \u201cThe ULEZ must come into force much sooner than planned \u2013 by the end of 2018 at the latest. Londoners shouldn\u2019t have to wait until 2021 for cleaner air. The zone must cover the whole of London to make a difference, extending beyond the north and south circular roads and including all of outer London too.\u201d\nBut there are numerous opponents, such as the Alliance of British Drivers and motorbike groups \u2013 and even the Musician\u2019s Union. The Motorcycle Action Group said: \u201cWill the mayor compensate the thousands of low-paid workers using small, older motorbikes because it\u2019s all they can afford, and what scheme will he be setting up to pay the difference in cost between cheap, older bikes and expensive public transport?\u201d\nHow will motorists in London react? Many will only be waking up to the charges just weeks before they come into force.\nGuardian journalist Graham Snowdon, who lives in Herne Hill, south London, and was driving a 2006 Ford Focus 1.8 diesel, says that he has been forced to buy a new car as a result of the ULEZ changes. \u201cI drive into what\u2019s currently the congestion charge zone once a week to play football. But it\u2019s in the evening, and I don\u2019t have to pay. The first I knew about ULEZ was an email I got from TfL. I knew it was expanding, but I didn\u2019t know what it entailed. It was going to cost me \u00a312.50 a week from this April \u2013 and then \u00a312.50 every day from 2021, so I had to get rid of the car.\n\u201cBut I suppose that I\u2019m not that annoyed; NOx emissions are really dangerous, and it\u2019s good in a way that I\u2019ve been forced to do this. The Ford Focus could probably have done another 50,000 miles or so. Instead, I\u2019ve paid \u00a38,000 for a second-hand 2014 Ford Focus 1.0 Ecoboost, and the bonus is that my car tax will now only be \u00a330 a year. I thought I better buy a new car now, ahead of April. When other people wake up to this, I think it\u2019s going to have quite an impact on the second-hand car market.\u201d",

        "content": "The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, on Westminster, Brexit dramas and why a sense of humour is vital\nAs I left the family breakfast table one recent Sunday morning to creep upstairs to our little study and flip open the laptop, my four-year-old son groaned: \u201cBrexit is wasting a lot of mummy-time.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not wrong: covering the slow-motion car crash of Britain\u2019s Brexit policy over the two-and-a-half years since the 2016 referendum has taken its toll in missed bedtimes and outings forgone.\nBut for politics freaks like me it has been relentlessly compelling, too. I have sat in more heart-stopping press conferences than I can count \u2013 from Boris Johnson flunking his leadership bid to Theresa May hauling us all to Downing Street to insist she would \u201cdeliver the runs\u201d, like her cricketing hero Geoffrey Boycott.\nI\u2019ve interviewed Jeremy Corbyn on his rain-lashed red battlebus, and at a sunbaked Tolpuddle festival, and stood in the stiflingly hot corridor outside a packed committee room as the prime minister urged her colleagues to spare her political life.\nAnd throughout the past two-and-a-half years, I\u2019ve watched MPs from both major parties wrestle with a political issue that has stretched their loyalties to breaking point and beyond.\nIn normal times (whatever they are) the resignation of a cabinet minister over policy is a rare moment of high drama. We\u2019ve seen four in the past six months over Brexit \u2013 David Davis, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey \u2013 and so many junior resignations that at times it has been hard to remember them for 24 hours, let alone days or weeks later.\nMy relentlessly cheerful and hardworking team are based in a dingy little room with mullioned windows, in the old part of the Palace of Westminster. It\u2019s boiling hot in summer and freezing cold in winter. We\u2019re fuelled by caffeine, political gossip and Tunnock\u2019s caramel wafers (thanks to proud Scot Pippa Crerar, now moved on to higher things at the Mirror).\nThe FT\u2019s political team are next door, with a little connecting corridor in between, lined with wooden doors, behind which (I\u2019m told) there were once little booths with phones for reporters to ring in their copy.\nTwice a day while parliament is sitting, the prime minister\u2019s affable official spokesman, James Slack, or his deputy hold on-the-record briefings with the lobby, as the political journalists who work in Westminster are called.\nThey take place in a tucked-away tower room it took me months to be able to find with confidence. On occasion, the atmosphere can be clubby and insiderish, but at other times incisive and relentless. And it forces Downing Street to be ready to explain the government\u2019s policy, on any conceivable subject, twice a day, every day.\nAs well as lobby briefings, a parliamentary pass brings with it the privilege (though it doesn\u2019t always feel like it) of being able to sit in the press gallery, high up above the green benches in the House of Commons, and watch MPs debate questions great and small.\nWhat always strikes you most \u2013 particularly at the weekly prime minister\u2019s questions session \u2013 is the sheer volume. MPs speaking from the dispatch box confront a wall of noise \u2013 not to mention the derisive hand gestures and relentless under-the-breath barracking, much of which goes undetected by the TV cameras.\nThere\u2019s an extraordinary repertoire of verbal responses I\u2019ve never heard anywhere else \u2013 the exultant \u201cMore!\u201d as MPs cheer on their leader, the fruity \u201cAaah!\u201d that translates as something like \u201cgotcha\u201d, and the sonorous Jim-Hacker-does-Churchill inflections that colour the speech of the most level-headed MPs when matters of national security are at stake.\nIt\u2019s intense, emotionally charged theatre \u2013 and at times, it\u2019s plain silly. But when every vote counts, as it has done at key moments in the Brexit process, it has a hard edge.\nWhen I came to the job in early 2016 \u2013 then with my much-missed jobshare partner and now Guardian podcast heroine Anushka Asthana \u2013 we were keen to highlight the fact that most politics happens far away from Westminster. That\u2019s where policies dreamed up in Whitehall hit millions of people\u2019s real lives, and elections and referendums are fought and won (or lost).\nThe referendum campaign made that point on a seismic scale, with the result confounding the commentariat and chucking out a prime minister who had won a majority a year earlier. And the 2017 general election, too, went against the grain of Westminster wisdom.\nAnd as a team, we still try to escape the daily diet of parliamentary drama when we can \u2013 most recently, for me, to Labour MP Gloria De Piero\u2019s constituency of Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, and for my colleague Peter Walker, to the Clacton, Essex, seat held by the Conservative MP Giles Watling. Both of us received a salutary reminder that Theresa May is regarded with considerably more warmth by voters than many of her own MPs.\nYet the nature of the Brexit negotiations, against the backdrop of a divided cabinet and a hung parliament, has made Westminster politics, in the narrow sense of who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down, and what alliances are being struck, arguably more important in shaping Britain\u2019s future than for decades.\nThat means plenty of time spent listening to MPs and trying to understand their concerns, their motivations and their breaking points \u2013 and thinking through countless possible permutations for the coming crucial weeks.\nA healthy knowledge of parliamentary procedure has proved essential, for which we all rely on the fount of wisdom and liveblog doyen Andy Sparrow. Goodness knows, so has humour, brought by the inestimable John Crace, who is just as funny in the office as on the page. And, of course, even in the thick of it all, family.\nThe day after the confidence vote in Theresa May, the result of which was not announced until 9pm, the indefatigable Dan Sabbagh jumped on the Eurostar to the European council in Brussels bright and early \u2013 and I went off to see my son\u2019s school nativity play. He played a cow, in case you were wondering.",

This week starts with a visit to a house where the occupants have seen and taken a photo of a rat climbing a tree and feeding from a fat ball meant for birds. I tell them it was probably because they were leaving too much food out and that they should stop. I put down some poison and arrange to return next week.\nNext up is a visit to a theatre, where a dead pigeon is squashed in the doors. I dissect it and remove it using shears and a sharp blade before I put it in a bag to make sure it\u2019s disposed of correctly because pigeons can carry disease.\nNowadays, with climate change and people travelling further, bedbugs have become more prolific and I can do two or three callouts a week. We\u2019re always concerned we\u2019ll spread them but we\u2019re vigilant with protective clothing. Sometimes I strip off in the backyard when I get home \u2013 they can hide anywhere. I make a return visit to a house where the owner had complained of an infestation. To their delight I find the bedbugs have gone.\nToday, rat jobs come in thick and fast. There are issues year-round. It can be very emotional because people don\u2019t want to live in their property if there are rats. It can be resolved simply if people call us in time. Some people leave it and try to get rid of them themselves, but others hear a noise and call us straightaway.\nI visit a company that has done its own pigeon proofing work, which is amateurish. Pigeons are getting trapped and it is a risk to the business. We remove the netting and put in some spikes, which doesn\u2019t kill anything but stops birds from landing. We do a full assessment to make sure any protected species, such as buzzards and kites, won\u2019t be harmed. We\u2019re proud that we\u2019re wildlife accredited and put a lot of time and money into it.\nI also visit a home where the discovery of a wasps\u2019 nest has stopped a workman in his tracks while he was tiling the roof. I spray the nest with an insecticide, which allows the tiler to get back to work within an hour.\nStaff from a residential care home have discovered a hole chewed in a door frame. I think it\u2019s probably the work of a mouse attracted by bird feeders in the garden. When we visit places with a pest control problem, we\u2019re seen as saviours because people are so desperate and need help. We get letters and emails of thanks. It\u2019s an interesting job because you meet a broad variety of people. I\u2019ve met people who have fought in wars. I remember one Polish man telling us about rats climbing from the ships when he was in the merchant navy.\nYou\u2019ve got to have a hardy stomach for this job and I am reminded of that today. We drop in at a conference centre to proof some air conditioning units to stop rats getting inside. While we\u2019re there, some staff tell us maggots are dropping from the ceiling in the ladies toilet. We investigate and find them all over the carpets in every room. We get harnessed up and go onto the roof voids. We find seven bird carcasses in the guttering, from which maggots are crawling. We get rid of them, much to the relief of everybody involved.\nIf you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@theguardian.com",

In this instance, however, the name ben ben refers to my friend, the great cook Ben Benton, on whose recipe this is based. Here, shiitake mushrooms rub alongside tahini and roast chilli oil to make an astoundingly good sauce that\u2019s hot enough to put hairs on your chest.\nThere are a few ingredients here that you might need to pop to a Chinese food shop for, such as the Shaoxing wine, Chianking vinegar and chilli oil (Lee Kum Kee does a great one), although some are also available in larger supermarkets and online. If you can\u2019t get hold of the wine, use dry sherry, and swap the Chianking for white-wine vinegar; you could even make your own chilli oil, too.\nPrep 15 min\n Cook 25 min\n Serves 2\n250g shiitake mushrooms1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns1 tbsp oil40g gherkins or pickled cucumber, finely chopped2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal, whites and greens separated1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry)2 tsp light soy sauce200g wholewheat noodles200g baby pak choi or similar greens, shredded\nFor the sauce3 tbsp tahini3 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp Sichuan roasted chilli oil, with sediment, plus an extra drizzle to finish1 tbsp Chianking black-rice vinegar\nBlitz the mushrooms in a food processor to lentil-size pieces \u2013 be careful they don\u2019t turn to soup.\nPut the peppercorns in a dry frying pan on a low heat and toast until fragrant \u2013 about four minutes, but be vigilant because they burn easily \u2013 then remove and grind. In the same pan, heat the oil on a high flame. When hot, fry the chopped mushrooms, pressing them into a single layer to maximise contact with the pan, for eight to 10 minutes, until dark brown and beginning to crisp up. Add the gherkins, spring onion whites and the ground Sichuan pepper, fry for two minutes, then add the wine and soy, and cook for two minutes more, until dry and crunchy.\nMix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. It will look a little split at first, but just keep mixing until it comes together.\nCook the noodles in boiling water according to the packet instructions, stirring to separate them, and add the pak choi for the final two minutes. Just before the noodles are done, remove a mugful of the cooking water, then drain and put the noodles and greens in a large bowl. Mix in the sauce, the mushrooms and the reserved cooking water, tablespoon by tablespoon (I needed six), until the noodles are nice and saucy.\nDivide between two plates, sprinkle with the spring onion greens and a drizzle more oil, and serve.",

In honour of her performances, here we present our definitive list of dancing politicians \u2013 ranked.\nOne of the most divisive figures in recent British political history, we can at least probably all agree that when called upon to dance in public, the Iron Lady danced passably, if in a slightly uninspired fashion. It seems that occasionally the lady was for turning, although a twirl seemed to have been deemed a step too far.\nThe same could not be said of Neil Kinnock. When not falling over on beaches, Labour\u2019s leader during many of the Thatcher years could sometimes be found starring in pop videos. Here he is, inexplicably making a cameo in the video for My Guy by Tracey Ullman, who equally inexplicably managed to rack up three top 10 hit singles in 1983.\nAt the height of the New Labour years, when not throwing punches, John Prescott could frequently be seen having a dance at Labour party conference. Here he is making shapes alongside a brass band and the Blairs \u2013 much, it appears, to the disdain of Gordon Brown lurking in the background.\nNot so much a dance as a sort of baffled nod and slight sway, ultra-Brexiteer John Redwood\u2019s highlight in office was his attempt to sing along to the Welsh national anthem, and the confused physical motion that went with it.\nTrailblazer Ann Widdecombe made a Strictly Come Dancing appearance a viable career option for an ex-politician in 2010. She managed to be the lowest-scoring celebrity in seven of the 10 weeks that she lasted in the competition, but the public kept voting her back for more. Her signature move was to essentially lurk at the back of the stage while Anton du Beke tried to distract the judges by actually dancing.\nThe Tory dream ticket, or your worst nightmare? Either way David and Boris appeared as a dancing double act as they joined forces to bop along enthusiastically to the Spice Girls at the 2012 London Olympic closing ceremony.\nIn between resigning in disgrace and reinventing himself as the Welsh Ukip assembly member who likes to hang around with alt-right internet trolls who\u2019ve taught him phrases such as \u201ctriggered\u201d and \u201ctruly dank memes\u201d, Neil Hamilton had to make a living. And at one point he made that living by dancing on TV in a glass box for Johnny Vegas while someone poured a bucket of fish over him.\nDespite repeated Republican attempts to humiliate her, the youngest ever US congresswoman still has an indefatigable sense of humour, and dance moves! After an anonymous Twitter user posted a video showing Ocasio-Cortez boogying during college, the 29-year-old reprised some old steps outside her office on Capitol Hill, tweeting: \u201cI hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!\u201d Cue further mock horror.\nEd Balls woke up on 7 May 2015 hoping by the end of the night to be chancellor of the exchequer. Instead, by the end of the night he was no longer an MP and just 16 months away from being Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s novelty political contestant. Who can forget the sight of the former shadow chancellor dancing to Gangnam Style on the nation\u2019s television sets? But probably his finest hour was an exquisitely camp salsa, while dressed as The Mask. Dance partner Katya Jones maintained her grace throughout the 10 weeks Ed survived on the show.\nWe have to hand top spot to Theresa. She went to Africa to boost post-Brexit British exports, and exported a whole load of dance memes. Since she first danced at a South African school, the video clip has been posted thousands of times on social media. Post-punk band Killing Joke even made a version soundtracked with their I Am The Virus single, and it has been re-cut by others, in honour of her Maybot reputation, so that she\u2019s dancing to Kraftwerk\u2019s The Robots. Congratulations, Theresa May. And maybe we\u2019ll eventually get to see her on Strictly once she\u2019s had enough of trying to steer the country through Brexit \u2026",

There are a few scant crumbs of mince pie and half a bottle of prosecco left in the fridge to remind you of the season just passed. But before your mind starts to turn to thoughts of a dry January, detoxes or juice cleanses, allow yourself one more little indulgence. It\u2019s going to be cold, damp and dark for a good while yet, so what better way to stave off the winter blues than a piping hot bowl of ginger pudding and caramel sauce?\nPrep 15 min\n Cook 15 min\n Makes 4 puds\nFor the sponge40g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing75g light brown sugar2 eggs50g plain flour1 tsp baking powder1 tsp ground ginger\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon2 pinches ground cloves2 balls stem ginger, cut into 2-3mm dice\nFor the caramel sauce100g light brown sugar35g unsalted butter150g creme fraiche1 tsp ground ginger\u00bc tsp salt\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

The Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, is an admirer of the 24-year-old central midfielder, having worked with him at Sevilla during the 2014-15 season.\nSu\u00e1rez, who spent two years at Manchester City as an academy player between 2011 and 2013, has played 46 league matches for Barcelona in two and a half seasons but never been able to hold down a regular starting place.\nThe Spaniard, who has one international cap, won in 2016, is under contract with Barcelona until 2020 and would cost around \u00a320m. He has played 221 minutes this season but only 17 of them in the league. The two clubs have opened talks and there is a keenness on both sides to get the deal over the line this month.\nArsenal are set to lose Aaron Ramsey on a free transfer in the summer with Juventus favourites to sign the 28-year-old.\nSouthampton are in talks with Sampdoria regarding the potential sale of Manolo Gabbiadini. The two clubs are discussing a loan until the end of the season with an obligation to buy the striker in the summer for a fee in the region of \u00a39m. However, Sampdoria first need to offload another forward, probably Gr\u00e9goire Defrel or Gianluca Caprari.\nGabbiadini, who joined from Napoli for \u00a315m in January 2017, has had an uneven spell at St Mary\u2019s. The striker started his career with a bang, scoring six goals in his first four games, including one against Manchester United in the League Cup final, but his form dipped and has been in and out of the team for the past 18 months.\nGabbiadini has one goal in 15 appearances this season and the new Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, has not included the 27-year-old in his past five matchday squads.",

I want to have a debate about how we are going to spend all the money we are going to have by not paying the \u00a339bn-plus of this agreement, and the continuing large contributions each year,\u201d he said.\nHe claimed that leaving the EU would allow the UK to look again at \u201crather penal\u201d import tariffs set by Brussels, encourage more domestic food production, to rebuild the fishing industry, and to control its own laws and borders.\n\u201cThere are huge agendas of opportunity, which are being crowded out by endless remain propaganda from people who tell us falsehoods about what might happen if we just left.\u201d\nSpeaking later on the same programme, Ken Clarke, a veteran Tory remain supporter, agreed it was unlikely that May would succeed in gaining parliament\u2019s backing for her deal. But politicians should not stop looking for ways to minimise the damage Brexit could cause to the country, he said.\nDespite claiming \u201cthe greatest respect\u201d for Redwood, Clarke rubbished the assertion that the economy could enjoy a boost in the event of a no-deal Brexit, arguing that any attempt to renege on the country\u2019s bills to Europe would deeply damage international relations.\n\u201cIf we were to repudiate all the financial obligations that we have had from the past then that will merely mean the tariffs and everything else will come in more quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Brexit dividend was always a complete myth. It was known to be a myth by the people who painted it on the bus.\u201d",

        "content": "It seems perverse yet unavoidably sensible to suggest that, of the six British players entered in the 2019 Australian Open, Andy Murray is by no means the most likely to reach the second week of a tournament he has been a finalist at five times.\nHe will do his best to get there, but recent history suggests the former world No 1 has less chance of making a memorable impact than Britain\u2019s best woman, Johanna Konta, or even the world No 14 Kyle Edmund, cut down by a knee injury in Brisbane and forced to withdraw from the Sydney Open.\nEdmund\u2019s declaration that he would \u201cdo everything I can to be fit for the first grand slam of the year\u201d did not inspire confidence that he will be able to replicate his run to the semi-finals a year ago, although his team insist his injury is not serious.\nMurray\u2019s fitness remains an ongoing puzzle. He confessed after a good win and a bad loss in his comeback in Brisbane this week that he had no idea how long he would stay in the game, but the angst in his voice suggested he will not go meekly. His hip still hinders his lateral movement, although his all-court speed is more convincing than during any of his 12 matches last year, when he beat two top-20 players in five wins.\nCertainly, he looked the part in beating James Duckworth in the opening round, but was disturbingly off the pace in two quick sets the following day when Daniil Medvedev put him out of a tournament he has won twice and in which he had been unbeaten.\nKatie Boulter and Heather Watson, who are warming up in Hobart, and Cam Norrie, who plays Beno\u00eet Paire in Auckland \u2013 where he grew up \u2013 complete the British sextet for the first grand slam of the season, which starts on 14 January . Still, for all their best ambitions, any of them would be pleased get past the first round. Which leaves Konta, 37 in the world and determined to put a nightmare 2018 behind her, as the standard bearer.\nMuch has changed for Konta since she went out in straight sets to Agnieszka Radwanska in the first round here a year ago: her coach, her management and, more importantly, her strategy. She was candid over lunch in London a few weeks ago when she spoke about the reason for her dramatic slide in the rankings after a season when she had announced her arrival at the summit of her sport with three breakthrough titles and a run to the Wimbledon semi-finals. \u201cI basically just ran out of steam,\u201d she said.\nTo fix that, she will play more selectively, she said, organising quality time to breath life back into her game and her enthusiasm for a sport she began in this city more than two decades ago. \u201cI\u2019m going to have cycles of tournaments, rest, train, tournaments, rest, train,\u201d she said.\nThe plan began brilliantly in Brisbane, when she played the former US Open champion Sloane Stephens off the court, then dipped alarmingly by losing in straight sets to world No 46, Ajla Tomljanovic. It was a worrying echo of her struggles last summer but Konta\u2019s self-belief has rarely been anything less than 100%, despite serial losses to players a long way below her in the rankings.\nKonta\u2019s mood will have improved after beating the Czech Miriam Kolodziejova 6-3, 6-2 in 71 minutes in Sydney yesterday.\nShe acknowledged change was needed. So out went her American coach, Michael Joyce, after less than a full season, and in came the Frenchman Dimitri Zavialoff. She and Joyce had a frank discussion in Wuhan that both acknowledged, \u201cWe\u2019d kind of come to the end of our road,\u201d as Konta put it \u2013 and it was all done a week later in Beijing.\nKonta says of Zavialoff, her fifth coach in 10 years: \u201cIt is much more of a partnership than I have had in previous coaching relationships. He encourages me to have a lot more input. There has to be a certain amount of compatibility. The personalities start to evolve and then, when you spend more time together in stressful situations, it becomes more apparent how well the two work together. But that takes time.\u201d\nElsewhere, there is calm for one man seemingly immune to stress. Roger Federer\u2019s 22nd successive win in Australia \u2013 since losing in the Hopman Cup two years ago \u2013 saw off Alexander Zverev for Switzerland against Germany in Perth on Saturday. Federer looked sharp, relaxed and happy.\n\u201cIt puts me in a good position [for Melbourne] which is wonderful,\u201d he said to an adoring audience of more than 14,000.\nWonderful for Federer . Not so great for opponents waiting for him to grow old more disgracefully. Novak Djokovic\u2019s surprise loss to Roberto Bautista Agut in Doha the previous evening will have put a spring in the 37-year-old\u2019s step and it is not beyond him to win his 21st slam in Melbourne, scene of his remarkable comeback after seven months out with a knee injury in 2017.",

        "content": "The food writer, journalist and campaigner opens up about how alcohol took over her life once fame struck. This is her mea culpa \nMy name is Jack Monroe, and I am an alcoholic. I said those words out loud to myself 10 days ago, waking up after yet another binge with a friend, watching Richard Curtis films until 4am, mixing cocktails and bitching about work until we passed out on the sofa.\nMy life can be defined by a kind of alcoholic bulimia. I either binged on it, or deprived myself of it out of misplaced puritanism and later, unaffordability. My parents did not drink in front of me as a child. I had no fake ID and looked 14 until my first grey hairs came in a couple of years ago.\nI had my first taste of alcohol at a friend\u2019s house party, aged 14 or 15, drinking alcopops in their living room while their parents were away, with some other kids from our church youth group. I enjoyed the feeling it gave me. I was shy, I stammered, I didn\u2019t have many close friends. At the next party I was drinking neat vodka from the bottle until I was sick.\nAt the next, a barbecue with some friends from my local karate club, I was carried to a cab by a burly, furious male driver with my trousers falling down, covered in my own vomit, having downed an entire litre bottle of Southern Comfort. I was 16. I was also lucky that the cabbie dropped me back to my nan\u2019s \u2013 I was too frightened to present myself at home in such a state at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon \u2013 and saw me safely inside. My nan cleaned me up and put me to bed.\nI spent my late teens working in a nightclub, back in the good old days when club nights ran from Wednesdays through to Mondays and the drug of choice was WKD rather than today\u2019s MDMA and GHB.\nWorking behind the cocktail bar was a different kind of escapism, a creative outlet with a newfound respect for alcohol. I didn\u2019t drink as I was also working day shifts in a coffee shop and, later, the fire service, and needed my wits about me to pull off my 60-hour working weeks.\nI left the nightclub when I was pregnant (needless to say, I was sober throughout), and the fire service two years later. I was on the dole, which led to a period of extreme poverty. Needless to say, I did not drink when I could not afford to feed myself and my son. I used the odd can of Sainsbury\u2019s Basics lager in a stew or casserole, but I didn\u2019t drink it. I want to be absolutely clear about that.\nI fell into a permanent habit of problematic drinking when I moved to London in 2014. I had my first book out, my second on the way, and had been uncomfortably catapulted into the public eye. It started with a glass of wine in the evenings. Every evening. Then two. Then a bottle. Then I started at lunchtime. I had a drink before I did any public talks, to calm my nerves.\nI joked with a runner at the Observer Festival of Ideas when he asked if I needed anything, \u201ca whisky would be great\u201d. He returned with two doubles. I laughed it off at the time, but it became a habit. I turned up on the BBC\u2019s This Week with Michael Portillo, after a Pride party at the US ambassador\u2019s residence. It was 11pm. I needed six double espressos before I could go in front of a camera. My friends waited for me in a car outside to take me back to the party. I was unhappy, but smiling for the cameras. I was drinking slugs of whisky before going on breakfast television.\nI was a disaster, screaming at the top of my lungs in plain sight, surrounded by enablers and bad choices, and I was going wrong. But I was functional, and so it didn\u2019t look like a problem. Not to me.\nI moved back home to Southend in 2015 for a quieter life. I didn\u2019t want to be having boozy lunch interviews with journalists any more. I couldn\u2019t stand the parties I needed to get smashed at to feel like I fitted in. I longed for my simple life back, standing at the stove, scrawling recipes in notebooks, blogging, reading, going for walks.\nI moved to a house a few roads away from my parents, back into my childhood neighbourhood, and started to request that journalists come to me, rather than meet me in a pub in the City. I started turning down party invitations. I lost a lot of friends. But the one that never left my side, stuck by me unwaveringly, came in a 40% abv bottle. It took a long time for me to recognise the extent of my problem, and longer still to do something about it.\nI would love to say I had a great awakening, one last bender, some voice from the heavens but, in truth, I am just tired of being tired. I have a chronic illness that is in the process of diagnosis, and sobriety won\u2019t cure me, but alcoholism certainly fogs the waters when it comes to separating what can be treated and what I\u2019m making worse.\nI\u2019m furious with myself about the jobs I\u2019ve turned down, the potential opportunities I\u2019ve lost, the deadlines I\u2019ve missed. I hope that this year the bridges I soaked in whisky and watched burn down will begin to be rebuilt.\nThis is my mea culpa. I\u2019m sorry I was unreliable. I\u2019m sorry I swore on television. I\u2019m sorry I missed so many of my son\u2019s class assemblies. I\u2019m sorry my manuscript was late. I\u2019m sorry to my ever-patient agent and her assistants for having to pick up the pieces every time I disappear on a three-day binge. I\u2019m sorry to every editor I ghosted, every friend I\u2019ve flaked out on, every person I\u2019ve verbally lashed out at in a paranoid and depressive comedown.\nI\u2019ve been a fucking atrocious, ghastly mess for a very long time, but I\u2019m out of excuses. Yes, I\u2019ve had a difficult road to here. Violence, sexual abuse, trauma, PTSD, poverty, low self-esteem. But I know that trying to black out my past with oblivion will just damage my future. I made the decision to stop running from my fears, and to walk slowly and deliberately towards self-nurture, self-respect, and better mental and physical health.\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy. At the time of writing this, I have been sober for exactly a week. The change has been remarkable. My house is tidier than it has ever been. I have reclaimed my evenings, and my early mornings, free from mental fog and headaches and grumps. My creativity has kicked back into action: in a bid to keep busy, I wrote, created, tested and photographed 50 new recipes last week \u2013 that\u2019s half a book!\nI spent new year at two parties: one with my friends Vix and Rhys and their friends, who filled their fridge with iced coffees and flavoured waters; and the other with my partner and her friends, who had got cinnamon Coca-Cola in and didn\u2019t comment once on my not drinking. I found a little new self-confidence, standing in rooms of old and new friends, making conversations I would remember, cracking jokes, not being too loud or boorish or inappropriate.\nThis, incidentally, is how to be a friend to a newly sober person. Get options in. Put the booze out of their sight and reach. Make them feel included. Don\u2019t offer them a drink, not even jokingly.\nI almost failed last week, a hundred times. Walking past the pub on the way to the supermarket, I felt as though a hook had landed in my breastbone and an invisible fishing line was reeling me towards the door. The pain was physical. I was shaking. My back was sweating. I put my shopping down. \u201cJust one,\u201d it whispered. \u201cNobody would know.\u201d\nI must have stood there for 10 minutes before, with an almighty heave of resolve, I picked my shopping up and marched home. I didn\u2019t look back. My shoulders and my arms and my heart were aching, but I didn\u2019t look back.\nLast Thursday evening, my son, eight years old, crawled into bed with me at 3am. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe, Mama,\u201d he wheezed. He was having a severe asthma attack. I bolted upright, grabbed Vaporub and an inhaler, sat him up, folded his arms across his chest the way paramedics had taught me, leaned him forward to open his airways, and listened to his breathing. I was wide awake, lucid, and this was an emergency. I know from my own childhood that asthma attacks can be fatal. I was poised to call 999 if there was even the slightest worsening in his chest.\nI lay awake beside him for the rest of the night, listening intently. I whispered to my partner on the other side of the bed, again and again, \u201cThank fuck I\u2019m sober\u201d. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ll stick at it. Because this week, I\u2019m a better writer, a better cook, a better girlfriend, a better mother, than I have been in the last five years.\nI have been tracking what I spent on alcohol last year by going through old receipts and bank statements. I will be moving the equivalent amount to a savings account for every week I stay sober. By the end of the year I should have a lump sum, a gift of security for my future, and forgiveness for my past.\nThis is my mea culpa. This is a new beginning. My name is Jack Monroe. I\u2019m an alcoholic. And I am recovering, one day at a time.",

It happened all around me during the time I was photographing.\u201d\nKillip was intrigued by the contrast between the epic scale of the ships that loomed over the streets of Wallsend and South Shields and the working-class communities that lived in their shadow. Here, children play on a quiet terraced street beneath the towering outline of the Tyne Pride, the biggest ship ever built on the Tyne and, as it turned out, one of the last. The red-brick houses, the stone wall, the fog lend the scene an almost Victorian feel. Within a few years, though, that way of life came to an end with a brutal finality. Just two years after this photograph was taken, Killip made another in the same place: the street was demolished, the community scattered.\nIn 1988, Killip condensed the work he had made in the north-east into the now classic book In Flagrante. Those bleak, desolate images were taken, photography writer Gerry Badger later wrote, \u201cfrom a point of view that opposed everything [Margaret Thatcher] stood for\u201d. Many of Killip\u2019s shipbuilding photographs, though, remained unseen until recently. Now, alongside three other series he made in the north-east \u2013 The Station (1985), Skinningrove (1981-84) and Portraits (1970-89) \u2013 The Last Ships (1975-1977) has been published as a large format zine. The scale suits the subject matter perfectly. The images, which move from the epic to the intimate, evoke another England in which the terms \u201cworking class\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d were still synonymous. It seems an eternity ago.\nThe Last Ships (\u00a320) can be purchased from ponybox.co.uk. Chris Killip: The Last Ships is at the Laing Gallery, Newcastle until 4 May 2020",

        "content": "As the shutdown\u2019s toll becomes clearer, the president aims to keep his pledge \u2013 but Democrats have reason to resist\nThere are two chants that everyone remembers from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. One is \u201cLock her up!\u201d, aimed at Hillary Clinton, a demand not likely to be met unless America becomes a banana republic. The other is \u201cbuild that wall!\u201d\nIt is now crunch time for this central, defining promise of the Trump candidacy and \u201cmake America great again\u201d movement. The US president says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures $5.6bn for a wall on the US-Mexico border.\nSo quarter of the US government has been shut down for two weeks, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without pay. After Friday\u2019s talks with congressional Democrats at the White House, there is still no end in sight.\nIndeed, no one should assume Trump was bluffing when he said he was willing to keep the government closed for months or even years, or that he would consider using emergency powers \u2013 an ominous phrase in any democracy under strain - to bypass Congress and get the wall built.\nIt has come to this because there is no political incentive for Trump or his nemesis, the newly re-elected House speaker Nancy Pelosi, to blink first. Both are under intense pressure from their respective bases to hold firm and resist concessions. The system has delivered divided government with no common ground.\nOn Thursday, Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News: \u201cBottom line, if there\u2019s no wall, there\u2019s no deal.\u201d Pelosi, meanwhile, told reporters on Capitol Hill: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\u201d\nA foreign visitor to the US might not immediately spot the signs of malaise. In grey and chilly Washington, traffic still rolls, trains still run, the shows goes on. The current shutdown has not affected three quarters of the government, including the Pentagon and the postal service, which have secure funding.\nBut there is a gradual sense of things grinding to a standstill, small but telling harbingers of imperial decline. The Smithsonian Institution\u2019s 17 museums and zoo are closed (although the animals are still getting fed). Couples in Washington cannot get marriage licences.\nNationally, 800,000 employees from the departments of homeland security and transportation and other agencies have been furloughed or are working without pay. Even as China lands a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, most employees at Nasa are on furlough, with the small percentage who remain working without pay.\nWith bitter irony given the issue at hand, the shutdown has reached America\u2019s 62 immigration courts. Hundreds of judges are on furlough, and only cases of immigrants in detention are being heard.\nThe National Park Service is operating with a skeleton staff. Some parks may be accessible, others closed completely. The National Park Service is providing no visitor services such as toilets, facility and road maintenance and trash collection. Campgrounds have begun closing due to sanitation concerns.\nAs the shutdown drags on, there will be a creeping paralysis, affecting everything from the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to pay out tax refunds to rental assistance payments in public housing to whether the interior department can pay out treaty rights obligations to Indian tribes.\nThe fact it is a partial, not total, government shutdown has perhaps tempted Trump to make a political calculation that the pain is preferable to giving in \u2013 or being seen to give in \u2013 on his promise to build the wall. It is worth remembering how fundamental this was to his campaign, his political identity, perhaps even his psyche.\nOn the day he launched his unlikely run for president, descending an escalator at Trump Tower in New York, Trump declared: \u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d\nMexico rejected the idea but Trump repeated the promise in almost every speech and interview, insisting the estimated $23bn barrier is necessary to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the US. For supporters and detractors alike, it became the ultimate symbol of his xenophobic vision of America.\nDemocrats\u2019 victory in the House in the midterms election means the dream has probably slipped away, but Trump cannot afford to admit it. When, last month, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a stopgap measure to keep the government open, he was poised to sign it until rightwing talking heads complained that he was capitulating.\nIn that sense, it is not a Trump shutdown or Pelosi shutdown. It is a Rush Limbaugh shutdown, an Ann Coulter shutdown. Rightwing minority rule is now holding the country to ransom.\nFor their part, Pelosi and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, see no reason to impose a medieval solution on a 21st century problem. They are also aware that Democrats were elected in 2018 by voters eager to resist Trump in general and the wall in particular. To give an inch would be seen as a betrayal. Pelosi declared this week: \u201cHow many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall.\u201d\nOn Friday, Trump and the Democratic leaders could not even agree whether their talks had gone well. Trump insisted the meeting had been \u201cvery productive\u201d, whereas Pelosi described the conversation as \u201csometimes contentious\u201d.\nAnd where, in all this, is Mitch McConnell? The Senate majority leader has been lurking on the sidelines, saying little other than that measures approved by the House are non-starters in the Senate without the president\u2019s support. The New York Times noted: \u201cBy absenting himself, Mr McConnell had hoped to push the blame for a prolonged shutdown on to Democrats while protecting Republicans running for re-election in 2020 \u2013 including himself.\u201d But with some Republicans becoming restless, it is not clear whether the strategy is sustainable.\nFor now, Trump has designated a working group led by Pence, and including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to conduct more negotiations. But the stalemate looks set to overtake the longest shutdown on record: 21 days under Bill Clinton in 1996.\nThe president\u2019s best hope now is to turn the dispute to his advantage by using Democrats as a foil in the 2020 presidential election. The line of argument will be along the lines of: I wanted to give you a wall, but the Democrats denied me \u2013 and you. That is why, in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, he reiterated: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",

        "content": "Christopher Raeburn has a lot to celebrate in his 10th anniversary show at London fashion week\nWhen the lights go up at Christopher Raeburn\u2019s 10th anniversary show at London fashion week men\u2019s on Sunday, the world can expect to be presented not just with a clothing collection but \u2013 as the designer puts it \u2013 \u201ca manifesto for change\u201d.\nIn the decade since he started his fashion label, the Royal College of Art graduate has become to the menswear fashion industry what Stella McCartney is to womenswear \u2013 the leading advocate of sustainability and responsibly sourced style. His brand\u2019s \u201cremade, reduced, recycled\u201d ethos permeates everything that comes out of his design studio in Hackney Central and has done from the start.\nUtilising used fabrics \u2013 including kites and vintage parachutes and other military stock \u2013 his designs have taken on a utilitarian-meets streetwear aesthetic. He is now looking to see how he can \u201cpush things further than ever before\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our opportunity to say, \u2018hey, that\u2019s been an amazing first chapter for the business and now we\u2019re building on our learning from the last 10 years\u2019,\u201d says Raeburn. His team has been \u201cmulching, shredding and making our own insulation from the off-cuts of materials that are being made in our atelier in east London and then making them into Puffa jackets\u201d for today\u2019s collection.\nThere\u2019s never been a better time to be leading the charge. Last year the United Nations launched a fashion industry charter for climate action and the Commons environmental audit committee announced it was investigating the sustainability of the fashion industry. Burberry pledged to reuse, repair or recycle products after the shocking revelation that it had destroyed \u00a328.6m of stock in 2017.\nBut 36-year-old Raeburn has been driving fashion in a responsible direction since he was discovered by the industry expert Susanne Tide-Frater in 2009. Asked by the British Fashion Council to mentor a new ecological brand, she chose Raeburn, having identified his \u201cradically different vision from what was then considered recycled\u201d.\n\u201cWhen I first met Christopher, his vision immediately exceeded other designers in his segment,\u201d says Tide-Frater, currently board director of Browns Fashion. \u201cIn fact, I have always considered him a creative entrepreneur rather than a fashion designer predicting or chasing the next trend. It was really just at the start of a very personal journey [for him], which at times has been challenging.\u201d\nOne of the main challenges facing sustainable design is dispelling the scepticism surrounding the \u201chomespun\u201d aesthetic. A major part of Raeburn\u2019s success has been his belief that covetable design and responsible infrastructure are not necessarily incompatible.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always approached my business from a design-led perspective first,\u201d he says. \u201cOur obligation as a company and for me as a designer is to make sure I\u2019m embedding good design with really considered choices around the way the materials are made, who\u2019s making them, where that item is made and what happens to it afterwards. If you\u2019ve ticked those boxes and something is fully recycled and recyclable, it becomes unquestionable.\u201d\nAnother challenge is keeping financially afloat while retaining creative control. \u201cWhere other designers expanded and took on major investment, Christopher self-financed and was always independent,\u201d says Tide-Frater.\nCollaborations with brands including Eastpak, Umbro and most recently Timberland (where he has since taken on global creative director duties) must be mutually beneficial in this respect, as well as pushing the brand\u2019s message into the mainstream. \u201cNot connecting with him would have been a big miss as he cares passionately about the overall \u2018making it better\u2019 concept which motivates Timberland\u2019s world, environment, design and products,\u201d said a spokesperson for the US brand.\nRecognition came in 2016 when Raeburn was named breakthrough designer at the GQ Men of The Year awards and the appetite for his designs and approach is picking up pace. His recent pop-up in London\u2019s new Coal Drops Yard development proved so successful that he is hoping to open a larger permanent space there in the spring, while the #buynothing campaign he launched on Black Friday \u201cas a challenge to the industry\u201d went viral.\n\u201cWith this race to the bottom of selling products at increasingly discounted rates, you have to really question where that\u2019s going to end up and we, within the industry, have an obligation to question ourselves,\u201d says Raeburn, who refused to sell anything that day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important for designers like Christopher to make a stand against over-consumption and to lead the way for a more responsible fashion industry,\u201d says Tamsin Blanchard, who works closely with the not-for-profit reform movement Fashion Revolution. \u201cBy disabling his online shop for Black Friday it was a way for him to protest against the insidious culture that is constantly nagging away at us to buy more, buy cheaper and buy it now.\u201d\nA decade in, Tide-Frater predicts a happy birthday for the designer. \u201cHis time may have finally come,\u201d says Tide-Frater. \u201cI strongly believe that only authentic designers and personalities like Christopher will give weight and credibility to the topic of sustainability which now has to be all our top priority.\u201d",

        "content": "There is a tendency for institutions that missed the warning signs before the last financial crisis to over-cook their doomsayer\u2019s warnings as they consider the potential for another one.\nThe International Monetary Fund leads a group of gloomy forecasters that worry about the stability of the global economy amid rising debt levels and slowing GDP growth. How long, they ask, can the expansion seen since the last crash go on before another recession hits?\nAnd if a global recession is pushed further into the future by even larger dollops of borrowed money from the financial system, will the next recession quickly become a crash of similar or even larger proportions than the one seen in 2008?\nSome analysts argue that such gloomy warnings ignore the precedent seen in recent years that major economies tend to start the year slowly before getting into gear later on. That was especially true in 2016, when most of the developed world saw only a small lift in GDP in the first quarter before growth took off.\nHowever, the three years from 2014 were characterised by falling oil and commodity prices, which moderated inflation. This gave the global economy a boost it desperately needed, albeit at the expense of oil- and commodity-exporting nations \u2013 and the environment. The boost faded in 2017 and left 2018 as a particularly unspectacular year \u2013 except in the US, where Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts more than made up for lacklustre global trade and fed a consumption boom.\nAs 2019 gets under way, things look very different. Consumer debt has risen back to pre-crisis levels in many countries. Corporate borrowing has soared and governments, while they have reduced annual deficits, continue to sit on mountains of debt that dwarf the borrowing seen before the crisis.\nAnother similarity with the pre-2008 period is the determination of central banks to increase borrowing costs. The speeches of central bank officials are littered with references to the need for higher rates, both to bring discipline back to borrowing and, in case another credit squeeze grips the banking sector, to have the tools to prevent a full-blown economic collapse. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said as much, though his remarks are tempered by threats of a no-deal Brexit. He has been echoed by Jerome Powell, his counterpart at the US Federal Reserve.\nThe Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, recently increased interest rates and signalled that it planned to continue on that path now that companies were reporting the largest labour shortages since 1996. Threadneedle Street has already raised its base rate from 0.25% in 2016 to 0.75%. The Fed is even further ahead, having pushed rates to a level of 2.25%-2.5% at its December meeting.\nJacking up rates to calm soaring economic growth \u2013 at least the kind of growth that can lead to inflation \u2013 is straight out of the textbooks. The trouble with doing it now is that growth is slowing: and while the UK and other countries may have full employment by traditional standards, it isn\u2019t the kind of full employment that leads to wage rises.\nThere are few detailed studies of today\u2019s labour market, but the situation seems to be that it was the 2008 crash \u2013 as much as the demise of collective bargaining and the growth of flexible contracts \u2013 that has knocked the stuffing out of the average worker, who feels unable to bargain up their wages.\nLabour-market economists like David Blanchflower and David Bell of Stirling University argue that unemployment needs to fall towards 2% before wages start to soar, rather than the 4%-4.5% that was considered the more traditional benchmark by central banks.\nWith only small or non-existent increases in wages above inflation, households might opt for more borrowing, or dip further into their savings to maintain consumption. Recent evidence shows they are doing neither. From the UK to China, consumers are viewing the coming year as a difficult period and not the moment to buy much, apart from life\u2019s basics. They did the same in the years before 2008, when property prices began to stagnate as buyers reached their borrowing limits and car sales slowed.\nThat turns the spotlight onto the IMF, which is concerned that higher loan costs and lower levels of consumer spending will mean that more corporations go bust. Its remedy has been for governments to pass reforms that allow more jobs to be created. However, the growth of flexible working has singularly failed to increase wage rates.\nLondon-based forecasters Fathom Consulting have pencilled in a global bust for 2020. Nouriel Roubini, who can claim to be one of the few economists to forecast the last crash, also nominates 2020. That\u2019s not much time to prepare.",

        "content": "App stores, Facebook, smartphone photography, even USB cables \u2013 they are all facing disruption this year\nAt the beginning of 2019, as at the start of 2018, Margrethe Vestager remains the most powerful woman in tech. The EU competition commissioner has the world\u2019s biggest companies walking on tiptoe, afraid of her habit of enforcing competition law where the US authorities have refused to do so.\nIn 2018, Google was the subject of Vestager\u2019s cold gaze, receiving multibillion fines for its anti-competitive practices around its Android operating system, its shopping service and Chrome browser. But in 2019, it\u2019s likely to be someone else\u2019s turn. The only question is who.\nIn the US, Amazon has been the odds-on favourite, thanks to a combination of a hostile president, a direct negative effect on commercial competitors and the rise of the doctrine of \u201chipster antitrust\u201d (broadly arguing that monopolies can be harmful even if consumer welfare appears to be boosted). But in the EU, with a greater focus on privacy and data protection issues, Facebook looks vulnerable.\nThe release by the UK parliament of internal Facebook emails appearing to show, among other things, Mark Zuckerberg authorising a hostile move to shut down access by Twitter\u2019s video app Vine won\u2019t endear the company to the competition commission. And, for many, Facebook still represents the great failure of competition commissions over the past 20 years, for rubber-stamping its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp \u2013 two of its greatest potential competitors still in their infancy.\nThe powers of the EU are limited \u2013 it would take the US to break up Facebook \u2013 but another multibillion fine won\u2019t go down well at the already troubled company.\nIt isn\u2019t just Facebook that might be feeling the hot breath of a regulator on its neck. The EU\u2019s ruling against Google\u2019s dominance of the Android app store could be the first domino to fall in a sweeping change that will reshape the consumer technology industry.\nSince the birth of the iPhone, a huge amount of digital commerce has been filtered through a few platforms, which have taken a hefty chunk of the revenue they handle. Apple takes 30% of app revenue, whether it be the purchase price of the software or the digital goods bought through it. Google, on Android, and Valve, for PC games, does similar. Each earns huge profits through being, essentially, the single point of entry for an industry.\nNow that\u2019s starting to wobble. Regulators are chipping away at one corner: Google\u2019s aforementioned fine in the EU and a court case in the US accusing Apple of abusing its monopoly over the iOS app store show the unease governments have over that centralisation of power. At the other end, slowly, power is shifting through external causes. Epic Games, maker of Fortnite, has become one of the few publishers to rival the power of the platform owners themselves and it is wielding it effectively: launching a new app store for Android devices and another for PCs and offering to take a substantially lower cut of game revenues on both.\nNot many brands have the following to pull off such a shift, but as many a parent will attest, Fortnite can move children where few others can.\nThere are two schools of thought surrounding driverless cars. One is that the technology is 99.9% complete and that soon \u201clevel five\u201d autonomy will be reached, meaning that cars can safely drive themselves in any situation. When that happens, the world will undergo rapid change, as driving jobs begin to disappear, urban spaces are reshaped and road travel becomes safer by the day.\nThe other is that the final 0.1% is harder than all of the previous progress put together. And so we\u2019ll remain, for years, with cars that work well enough to demonstrate, to put on the streets with safety drivers and continue being tested, funded and improved \u2013 but not quite well enough to actually build a business around.\nBoth views may be true. In the meantime, however, a 99.9% good enough car is good enough to run a taxi service \u2013 as Google is showing in Phoenix, where Waymo One, the company\u2019s Uber competitor, is launching. What\u2019s most interesting about the service is how\u2026 uninteresting it is. The taxis aren\u2019t significantly cheaper than the competition; the journeys have the occasional glitch, as overcautious algorithms get stuck at T-junctions.\nMaybe one day driverless cars will change the world, but not yet.\nOnly a fool would predict the death of bitcoin, let alone the wider industry it has spawned. The community has repeatedly shown an impressive capacity for survival against gigantic crashes, crippling hacks and severe legal roadblocks, and the nature of the blockchain is such that, if even one diehard is still mining bitcoin in an attic somewhere, it can never be said to be truly over.\nBut the price of bitcoin has been falling for months and now stands at a fifth of its all-time high. Ethereum, an even techier alternative, has fallen almost three times that. These prices are not only a vague reflection of the interest the wider world has in cryptocurrencies \u2013 at least in so far as they can be used as a speculative asset \u2013 but also a very real reduction in the amount of money knocking around the ecosystem, funding startups, paying salaries and subsidising customer acquisition.\nThat means that the number of actually useful creations (as opposed to white papers, test networks, experimental trials or proofs of concept) to come out of the sector \u2013 a number already hovering somewhere in the region of zero \u2013 is likely to stay low for a while.\nMaybe this will be the year that the industry puts its head down, starts putting substance over hype, and emerges in 2020 with something to show for more than a decade of speculation; or maybe this will be the year it slowly suffocates, deprived of the attention it needs to live. Either way, at least we can take a break.\nSmartphone innovation has stagnated in recent years; screens have got as good as they\u2019re going to get, battery life is hitting the limits of physics and processors have become so fast that developers are already struggling to use all the power at their fingertips.\nBut one of the last areas of competition is in the camera on the back of the phones. For Apple, that has meant moving to two lenses on the back of its top-end phones, investing in sapphire glass to minimise scratching and putting a hardware \u201cneural engine\u201d inside the phone to handle some of the more complicated elements of \u201ccomputational photography\u201d \u2013 using machine learning to manipulate images.\nFor Google, the approach has been entirely about software. Like Apple, it has focused heavily on computational photography, but it has taken it further than anyone else. Nowhere is this more evident than the stunning \u201cnight sight\u201d feature released towards the end of 2018, which uses a neural network to brighten low-light shots, turning grainy, grey stills into stunningly bright and clear images.\nBut what\u2019s most interesting about night sight is that the feature doesn\u2019t just brighten images and reduce grain. It adds in detail that was never captured by the sensor in the first place, effectively \u201cguessing\u201d what the image would have looked like if it were better lit. It\u2019s less photography and more computer-aided illustration, creating an artificial image based on reality that is more real than real. And that\u2019s only going to intensify as other companies attempt to copy Google and Apple, or surpass them with their own features.\nIn theory, the USB-C connector is better than its predecessor. The standard has some obvious physical benefits: a smaller plug that works in any orientation; the ability to transmit more power, more data and more standards; cables that can be used in either direction, across domains.\nIn practice, however, the transition has been exhausting. For one, there\u2019s been the standard pain of chucking out cables, chargers and accessories built for a now obsolete format and replacing them slowly \u2013 and expensively \u2013 with new versions.\nAlso, USB-C\u2019s flexibility has been a weakness, not a strength. Take Apple\u2019s laptop line, for instance. If you have a MacBook with one USB-C port, that port can transmit data using the USB 3.0 protocol. If you have the latest MacBook Pro with four USB-C ports, those identical sockets can also transmit data using the Thunderbolt 3 protocol, a significantly higher-bandwidth system that can be used to power high-resolution external monitors and graphics cards. But if that MacBook Pro was bought in 2016 or 2017, only the two ports on the left side of the computer actually had full Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth. The two ports on the righthand side \u2013 again, visually identical \u2013 didn\u2019t deliver full bandwidth.\nEven the cables are baffling. Just because a piece of wire has a USB-C plug at each end doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it can charge a device at full speed, let alone transfer data at maximum bandwidth.\nOver 2019, these ridiculous situations will hopefully even out a bit, allowing the promise of \u201cone cable to rule them all\u201d finally to be met.\nIt\u2019s rare for world-changing technological events to come completely by surprise. In 2017, the WannaCry cyber-attack that shut down the NHS was largely foreseeable: it exploited a vulnerability that had been patched by Microsoft months earlier to combine an example of crypto-ransomware, first seen years earlier, with so-called \u201cworm\u201d mechanics that allowed it to self-propagate, first seen decades earlier.\nBut despite that, WannaCry changed the landscape permanently. Before, we all knew that a major malware attack could cause real-world harm; but Wannacry revealed that the \u201cwe\u201d was a smaller group than it had thought, and what it \u201cknew\u201d was less useful than it had hoped.\nJust last month, we saw another example of the same sort of unsurprising surprise, as a drone was used to shut down Gatwick airport for 24 hours. Again, the ingredients had been in place for years before \u2013 as had some of the tools necessary to prevent such an attack \u2013 but the chaos that ensued proved the difference between knowing a threat exists and internalising that threat to the degree that you build useful plans to tackle it.\nThis year will be the same. Some of the big events that subtly alter our understanding of how the world works won\u2019t involve megadeaths and cataclysmic destruction. But they can still be horribly disruptive anyway.\nPerhaps a massive botnet is used to overwhelm the servers of a supermarket\u2019s logistics division.

He was an honourable man and would always help somebody who was in trouble. He was a loving husband and father, he will be deeply missed by all his family.\n\u201cLee would have had his birthday today but did not get to see his presents. He was an honest, bright person who loved music very much, he knew history and art and he was a bachelor of science in Maths.\u201d\nHis family said the trip with his son was planned so they could spend some quality time together. They described the attack as \u201chorrific and pointless\u201d.\nThe statement came hours after police hunting the man who killed Pomeroy announced they had arrested a suspect.\nThe 35-year-old was detained at an address in the Farnham area at about 6am on Saturday on suspicion of murder. A 27-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.\nDCI Sam Blackburn from BTP said: \u201cThis is a fast-moving investigation and I am pleased that overnight we were able to arrest a man following a huge amount of police inquiries.\n\u201cThe investigation is moving with good progress and we are now confident to say that this is not believed to be a random assault.\n\u201cIn the moments leading to the violent killing, both men appeared to be involved in an altercation lasting three minutes. Nothing justified the extraordinary violence that followed and we are concentrating our efforts on the ongoing investigation.\u201d\nPomeroy\u2019s son and other family members are being supported by family liaison officers.\n\u201cWe are continuing our appeal for information and I would urge anyone who was onboard the train to contact us as soon as possible,\u201d Blackburn added.\n This article was amended on 7 January 2019 to correct the spelling of Lee Pomeroy\u2019s name in the text, subheading and picture caption, which an earlier version spelled as Pomery.",

        "content": "For Lincoln City there will be no new shockwave to follow the one they caused in 2017 by becoming the first non-league club for 103 years to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals but they certainly gave it a good go. On a chilly Merseyside afternoon Danny Cowley\u2019s men, now leaders of League Two, pushed Everton all the way in a third-round tie during which it was tough at times to tell the favourites from the underdogs.\nHaving gone 2-0 up in the space of two first-half minutes, Everton ultimately did enough to seal their place in the fourth round but this was another largely unconvincing display from Marco Silva\u2019s side.\nEverton toiled against opponents who sit 58 places below them and all but closed that gap with a display brimming with togetherness and defiance. Indeed, it was telling that, having been roared on throughout from the 5,000 or so spectators who travelled here from the east Midlands, Lincoln\u2019s players also received a standing ovation from sections of the home support on the final whistle \u2013 a nice touch and one that was richly deserved.\n\u201cWe can be really proud of our efforts,\u201d said Cowley. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 2-0 down after 15 minutes at a Premier League club you fear the worst. But we\u2019ve got a really resilient, gritty group and we showed all of those qualities.\u201d\nThat they did, most notably Michael O\u2019Connor and the captain Lee Frecklington in central midfield, while Tom Pett, operating just behind the combative lone striker, John Akinde, also caught the eye with his work-rate and determination. It was not pretty but it was absorbing and on 82 minutes a replay looked on the cards after Jason Shackell rose to meet Bruno Andrade\u2019s left-sided corner. The ball appeared to be heading in only for Richarlison, having just come on as a substitute, to clear the effort from underneath his crossbar.\nIt was via Shackell\u2019s head that Lincoln got back into the game. On 28 minutes the centre-half met O\u2019Connor\u2019s free-kick and, though Jordan Pickford was able to keep his effort out with an excellent reaction save, he could do nothing to stop Lincoln\u2019s other centre-half, Michael Bostwick, from smashing in the rebound.\nIt was a bolt from the blue \u2013 or rather from the red and white \u2013 and, as Silva conceded, his players subsequently lost their focus having started this game in commanding manner. A side containing five changes from that which lost to Leicester here on New Year\u2019s Day moved the ball with composure and confidence and struck after 12 minutes when Ademola Lookman glanced in Leighton Baines\u2019 cross. Bernard quickly doubled the hosts\u2019 lead with a lovely lifted finish following Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s deft pass. It was the Brazil international\u2019s first goal for Everton since joining from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer.\nLookman and Bernard were two of the players brought into the home team\u2019s lineup by Silva and they generally impressed but many others in blue failed to make an impact. While this was a much-needed result for Everton following a run of one victory in eight games, it did little to suggest all is going to plan under their latest manager.\n\u201cIt looked in some moments that we didn\u2019t want to have a quiet afternoon,\u201d said Silva. \u201cBut we achieve the main thing to play the next round. That was our obligation.\u201d",

Riot police forced demonstrators back using teargas after coming under a hail of projectiles.\nA restaurant boat on the Seine was set alight along with dozens of scooters and motorbikes.\nOn the Boulevard Saint Germain in the centre of Paris, tourists looked on as a group of protesters, most of whom were not wearing the eponymous yellow vests, blocked the street with a barricade made of rubbish bins, barriers and Christmas trees from a nearby market, which they set alight.\nPolice said there were about 4,000 protesters in the city and a total of 25,000 across France. The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, called for \u201cresponsibility\u201d and for protesters to respect the law.\nOutside the French capital there were demonstrations in other cities including Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Rouen, Montpellier and Marseille. Several thousands gilets jaunes blocked the A7 motorway at Lyon causing traffic jams for people returning from their Christmas holidays.\nGilets jaunes protests began in November to oppose proposed hikes in fuel taxes. The movement has since enlarged to encompass wider grievances against President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist government.\nProtesters have rejected concessions announced by Macron aimed at responding to public anger, prompting the government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, to accuse them of insurrection.\n\u201cThe gilets jaunes movement for those who are still mobilised have become agitators who want insurrection and, basically, to overthrow the government,\u201d Griveaux said.\n\u201cThey have engaged in a political battle to contest the legitimacy of the government and president. These people who call for debate don\u2019t want to take part in our national debate. I call on them to participate.\u201d\nHe said Macron had called on ministers to be \u201cmore radical\u201d in their attempt to reform the country.\nGriveaux was evacuated from his office on Saturday afternoon after \u201cseveral individuals\u201d used a mechanical digger to break down the door. The government spokesman was taken out of a back door after the intruders reportedly smashed through a grille into the courtyard of an annex to the finance and economy ministry where he has his office.\nAfterwards Griveaux said it was not a personal attack, but one on the republic. It is not known if the intruders are linked to the gilets jaunes movement.\nThe group has turned down the president\u2019s invitation to take part in a national debate, due to begin this month, describing it as a \u201cpolitical trap\u201d. In an open letter read outside Paris city hall on Saturday, they warned Macron: \u201cAnger will turn into hate if from your pedestal, you and your like treat ordinary people like beggars, the toothless, those who are nothing.\u201d\nThis is a direct reference to Macron\u2019s televised new year message in which he targeted those who \u201cclaim to speak in the name of the people\u201d but who are \u201cnothing but the voice of a hate-crowd\u201d.\nThe letter demanded a \u201csignificant reduction in all taxes on essential goods\u201d and a reduction of the privileges enjoyed by high-ranking civil servants and elected representatives.\nThe gilets jaunes are also demanding the president name a \u201crespectable person\u201d to act as mediator.\n\u201cWe come together, we can do better and we will do better. And, yes, we will go further,\u201d the letter concluded.",

A recent report commissioned by the Cheshire police commissioner urged the government to reform foxhunting laws after MPs raised concerns over allegations of illegal hunting this year.\nIt follows an incident in Macclesfield in 2017 where a fox was allegedly killed when a hunt spilled on to a residential street.\nCheshire police have never successfully prosecuted anyone for illegal hunting \u2013 and have passed only one file to the Crown Prosecution Service in three years.\nLabour has said that it would strengthen the 2004 Hunting Act and remove legal loopholes that make prosecutions hard to achieve.

Which books best show how and why this happens?Calum Michael, 22, engineering student, Glasgow\nA: Lisa Appignanesi, author, visiting professor in literature at King\u2019s College London and chair of the Royal Society of Literature:\nThere are some gripping novels about how groups, even idealistic ones, coalesce, move through power struggles and then degenerate, engaging in moral and sometimes murderous excesses. In George Orwell\u2019s magnificent parable about Stalinism, Animal Farm, the disparate animals come together as a group around the naming of a common enemy \u2013 man. But when their leaders \u2013 pigs who champion rebellion \u2013 fall out, they provide a new, scapegoated enemy.\nScapegoats are an inevitable feature of group life. They become the instrument of togetherness. In William Golding\u2019s allegorical Lord of the Flies a group of young boys stranded on an island descends into leadership battles and ultimate depravity. Margaret Atwood\u2019s Cat\u2019s Eye provides a more realist optic, brilliantly illuminating how her heroine, something of an outsider, is victimised by a group of girls and its seductive leader, a best friend who is adept at power plays and attracts by her cruelty.\nThe famous psychoanalyst DW Winnicott, who worked with the young and wrote a great deal about adolescence, a time of emotional excess and lability (eg Deprivation and Delinquency), talks of the group as a way of providing the identifications, and the needs for defiance and dependence, that seem essential to that time of life.\nAnd Sigmund Freud\u2019s Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921) still provides some of the most interesting formulations as to why groups are needed, and go wrong \u2013 and how leaders, with whom we identify in various ways, work on our emotions.\nSubmit your question for Book Clinic below or email bookclinic@observer.co.uk",

        "content": "When Serena Guthrie left Team Bath in 2015, relocating to the netball strongholds of New Zealand and Australia for the peak years of her career, it was difficult to entertain serious thoughts that England could decisively shift the sport\u2019s dial. The flow of talent was going one way, the national team was consistently a step behind the antipodeans and the domestic game\u2019s growth was not rapid enough to provide a credible platform for players at the very top level.\nOn the day she turned 29, Guthrie returned to a stage that could hardly have appeared more different. These days English netball is confident, vibrant, comfortable in its own skin. Guthrie, the influential centre in the Commonwealth Games-winning national team, was back in her old team\u2019s colours for the 2019 Netball Superleague opener and the sense of momentum was unmistakable.\n\u201cTen years ago this just wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d she said of a healthy 5,351 crowd at Arena Birmingham, many of whom stayed for all five games of an intensive \u201cSuper 10\u201d matchday designed to put all the domestic big hitters in the limelight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really cool time to be a netballer in this country. I want whatever I experienced [in Australia] to happen in England. If I can help to be a part of that, then amazing.\u201d\nEngland Netball\u2019s unofficial target is for the Superleague to be able to compete with the world\u2019s biggest by 2022. That Guthrie is back to help out constitutes a significant feather in the cap and the return of the England captain, Ama Agbeze, who is recovering from knee surgery and sat out of London Pulse\u2019s thrilling last-gasp defeat to Severn Stars on Saturday afternoon, adds further weight to a product whose audience is widening appreciably.\n\u201cWhen you walk into an event like this, there\u2019s a different feeling around the sport,\u201d said Joanne Adams, the chief executive of England Netball. \u201cI feel incredibly proud.\n\u201cEngland\u2019s success has given netball players pride in their sport. Previously, they didn\u2019t exactly hide the fact they were netballers but they didn\u2019t openly talk about it. Now the perception has changed and people know this is a fantastic women\u2019s sport.\u201d\nThe crowd\u2019s demographic was subtly different from the norm. Previously, matches would be attended by a predominantly young, female base. Here, there were plenty of older faces \u2013 an impression perhaps confirmed when the Tina Turner tribute act commissioned to entertain between matches drew far wilder applause than similar impressions of Ariana Grande and Kylie Minogue \u2013 and the male representation was notable, too. \u201cThere are general sports fans here as well as just netball fans,\u201d Adams said, and those on a learning curve have joined at the right time.\nThey saw Guthrie put on a mini-masterclass in Team Bath\u2019s 58-41 win over the Cardiff-based side Celtic Dragons, who finished bottom of the league last season. She drew gasps with one reverse pass from next to her own semi-circle, another slick turn and release causing a supporter to exclaim: \u201cShe\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nIn a sport where space is at a premium, and the real art comes in mustering the extra half-second to find some, it was the kind of elite perpetual-motion performance that justified the decision to set ticket prices at a typical \u00a335.\nAdams and her colleagues did not want to offer this event for peanuts. \u201cFor netball to actually hold commercial value it has to have a credibility,\u201d she says. \u201cSome sports offer tickets for a fiver \u2013 we don\u2019t want to take advantage of anybody but this can\u2019t be a giveaway sport.\u201d\nThe intensity and tempo, for anybody who has not attended a live game, are eyecatching. \u201cI think people are starting to understand just how fierce and fast this sport is, and just how hard we athletes work out there\u201a\u201c said Natalie Panagarry, a recent call-up to the England squad whose Loughborough Lightning side were thrashed 72-42 by the champions, Wasps, in the second game. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice that people are recognising it, but we\u2019ve always been here, always been doing that.\u201d\nThe task now, in a year that will bring a World Cup to England in July and a keenly awaited Quad Series against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa next weekend, is to make use of the springboard. The strength of the league and of the national team are, to an extent, symbiotic: if England are performing well, the local game will attract more attention and the talent pool is only likely to increase, particularly with an estimated 1.4 million women playing netball every week. \u201cIf young girls don\u2019t get to see their role models play live then it\u2019s much harder to get them to play the sport,\u201d Adams said.\nTheir attention was held on Saturday, and not only by Guthrie. Not everything about the occasion was note perfect \u2013 a request for fans to come in fancy dress as \u201cfemale icons\u201d was almost entirely ignored and perhaps netball\u2019s status these days merits a keener focus on sporting entertainment \u2013 but British netball\u2019s journey into uncharted territory as popular spectator sport is in its early stages.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to riding the wave, riding the hype,\u201d Guthrie said.\nOn this evidence she has no shortage of people to take with her.",

        "content": "With less than two minutes on the clock Michael Jolley looked up at the heavens and shook his head in disbelief. The Grimsby manager had just seen his defender Andrew Fox dismissed \u2013 with a little help from the video assistant referee \u2013 for a poor tackle on Andros Townsend and faced the prospect of playing almost the entire match against Premier League opposition with 10 men.\nBut having been to the wilderness of the National League and back since they last visited Selhurst Park in 2003, Grimsby are made of stern stuff and it took until the 86th minute for their resolve finally to be broken, by the substitute Jordan Ayew\u2019s header from Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s free-kick.\nFor Jolley, the former investment banker who began his coaching career at Palace\u2019s academy, it was a cruel way to lose but he will be extremely proud of the way his side stuck to their task after such an early setback, with James McKeown making a string of excellent saves to frustrate the hosts.\n\u201cThe result is incredibly disappointing but we were applauded off the pitch by the Palace supporters which says everything about our performance,\u201d said Jolley. \u201cIt was a mammoth task with 10 men and we almost got there. The players delivered a performance that Grimsby can be proud of.\u201d\nThis was the first time these sides had met in the FA Cup since Grimsby beat a non-league Palace team 1-0 in 1908 and the presence of almost 6,000 visiting supporters who had made the trip from Lincolnshire certainly gave the tie extra spice.\nThe home manager, Roy Hodgson,, who embraced warmly with his opposite number before kick-off, to his credit, kept his word by naming a strong side \u2013 albeit with nine changes from their win at Wolves on Wednesday \u2013 including Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha in attack.\nGrimsby, who came into the match having seen their four-match winning streak end at home against Mansfield on New Year\u2019s Day, were looking to reach the fourth round for the first time in 19 years but saw their chances seemingly evaporate inside the opening 100 seconds. Townsend was going nowhere when he received the ball just inside the opposition\u2019s half but an over-exuberant lunge by Fox caught the forward on the shin. At first the referee, Martin Atkinson, allowed play to continue before booking the transgressor when the ball went out of play.\nIt was only then that he received the signal from the VAR and upgraded the punishment to a red card, with one Grimsby fan showing his frustration by throwing something on to the pitch as Fox departed. Suddenly the size of their task had increased exponentially. Yet despite Alexander S\u00f8rloth spurning two golden opportunities as Palace piled on the pressure, Grimsby somehow navigated their way to the half-hour mark and even had a sniff of goal when their top scorer, Wes Thomas, almost found a way through from Elliot Embleton\u2019s pass.\nThey had McKeown to thank, after he reacted brilliantly to tip Martin Kelly\u2019s drive on to the post before Palace\u2019s left-back Pape Souar\u00e9 limped off following a heavy challenge. And, despite Palace mustering 14 shots in total, the visitors made it to the break unscathed, if not at full strength.\nThe theme was no different in the second half as the hosts continued to press forward but their struggles highlighted the recurring issues for Hodgson\u2019s side in front of goal. After Kelly was once again denied by McKeown, and Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 hit the post with a header, the ineffective S\u00f8rloth was replaced by Connor Wickham, while Ayew, who scored his first goal for the club in the victory over Wolves, was introduced soon afterwards.\nEven then Grimsby could have snatched the win as they took advantage of Palace\u2019s lack of cutting edge to push forward in the last 10 minutes, although Wayne Hennessey was never really seriously tested on his return to the side. But then came the second sucker punch for Jolley and his brave team.\n\u201cIt was attritional,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cWe\u2019d had a few chances before we finally scored the goal but you have to give a lot of credit to Grimsby, having lost a player so early on.\u201d",

        "content": "With a devastating ACL injury, the 2018 AFLW season was cruel to Hickey, but she\u2019s back and raring to go with Geelong Cats\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got my new diary for the year and it draws out your goals. It\u2019s a pretty cool time of year to reflect on the year that\u2019s been. It becomes a launching pad of what\u2019s to come.\u201d\nOver coffee in a Brunswick cafe, AFLW player Melissa Hickey shows me the pages of her 2019 diary.\n\u201cThis is a really cool diary, I had the same one last year. It gives you each week to plan. You\u2019ve got your priorities, your weekly goals, gratitude and your habits you\u2019re trying to bring in for the week. It kind of gets you to check yourself. It\u2019s a values based thing, it makes me think about what I prioritise. Footy is always number one.\u201d\nThe 2018 AFLW season was cruel to Hickey. She suffered a devastating ACL injury and was forced to watch her Melbourne Demons narrowly miss the opportunity to play in the AFLW grand final from the sidelines.\nAs she sets her goals for 2019, her year couldn\u2019t look more promising. A new club, coming back strong from injury and as she prepares to take the reins in her new role as the inaugural captain of the Geelong Cats AFLW team, and she\u2019s already ticking off some of her goals in her diary.\n\u201cI really wanted to be the captain or vice-captain at Geelong, that was almost like a goal I set for myself, so in some ways I was doing it from just being me from day one at the club. I just hoped that resonated with the playing group.\u201d\nAs Hickey enters her tenth year of playing the game, she\u2019s self-aware and astute to the role she wants to play at Geelong from the lessons she\u2019s learned in her football journey.\n\u201cI hope my style of leadership is to really try to empower people. I think I was a lot more individually focussed in the past about my goals, a premiership was always number one, but then I wanted to get All Australian and Best and Fairest and stuff like that. That doesn\u2019t drive me so much anymore, it would be amazing, but it\u2019s not really my focus.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an extra sense of pressure there now because the captain has to perform. First and foremost you have to be playing well and I\u2019m probably someone who leads by example in that regard. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be my pre-game speeches that get us over the line!\u201d\nThe last 12 months have also been a time of personal transition and growth for Hickey whose challenges were not just restricted to the field. In some tough times, she\u2019s been able to develop her resilience as she focusses on the next stage in her football career and her life. She\u2019s also learnt that no matter how many goals and plans you can write down in your diary, you can\u2019t control everything.\n\u201cWhen my long-term partner and I broke up, before that I thought I had everything planned out. Everything was pretty set and it was almost like, someone used this analogy with me, that you\u2019ve got your jigsaw puzzle and you\u2019re starting to put all the pieces together and then someone\u2019s come along and whacked it and so all the pieces kind of fell out.\u201d\nHickey is excited to be looking forward to the possibilities a new year can bring.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s kind of cool to think, well I\u2019ve almost got a blank canvas again and think, what do I want to do? What actually feels right for me and what fulfils me which sometimes you can lose in a long-term relationship.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had so much growth because I\u2019ve had so many challenges and been uncomfortable and then I did my knee. So it\u2019s been a year of learning, sometimes you just can\u2019t control things, shit just happens and then you have to have the ability to bounce back from that or find the meaning in that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a yin and yang pull, it\u2019s chaos and order. You can\u2019t always have order, sometimes you need to be in chaos.\u201d\nIt is this perspective and emotional intelligence that will serve Geelong well by having Hickey as captain. Her experience in overcoming adversity has given her many tools to lead and inspire but it has also allowed her to identify how things that many might see as small or innocuous can contribute to someone else\u2019s resilience toolkit.\n\u201cI\u2019m working with one of the girls at the club to try to get her to accept compliments, just to say, \u2018thank you\u2019 if you get a compliment rather than deflecting it. Because there are stepping stones from that, self-belief comes from that. I look at her and think she\u2019s already a good footballer, just wait until she believes she is.\u201d\nThese small moments, these interactions come from someone who was a leader long before they were given a captaincy title and despite having the captaincy as one of her goals, she\u2019s aware of her reasons for wanting it and why that\u2019s so important.\n\u201cI read and listen to a lot of stuff on leadership and they say that if you\u2019re leading for the purpose to be the leader then you\u2019re missing the point. You lead to help out your mates or because it\u2019s the right thing to do and if you\u2019re expecting anything back, you\u2019re not in it for the right reasons.\u201d\nAs we finish up our coffee and I begin to make my way home, Hickey says she is going to stay at the cafe and take some time plan her week and reflect on what\u2019s been and what\u2019s to come.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just kind of my learnings from a full on twelve months. I can quite honestly say that something I thought at the time was one of the worst things to happen to me is now probably almost the best thing to ever happen to me because I\u2019ve gone back to being more who I am, back to my real self. I\u2019ve prioritised friendships and I\u2019ve got a lot more love in my life from that now and that freedom to be like, well, what do I want to do with my life? And you could meet someone next month who is the most incredible person in the world and that\u2019s exciting, and then footy is just there tracking along.\u201d\nI ask just as I\u2019m about to leave: \u201cDoes footy make everything better?\u201d\nShe smiles. \u201cYeah it does. It\u2019s so cool like that.\u201d",

Hence the term[s] Fake News, Enemy of the People, and Opposition Party!\u201d\nAbramson was the first woman to be executive editor of the Times, filling the role from 2011 to 2014.

In her book, discussion of Baquet\u2019s choices in steering the paper includes the words: \u201cHis news pages were unmistakably anti-Trump.\u201d\nIn an emailed statement, a Times spokeswoman said: \u201cEvery political administration complains about the scrutiny and coverage it receives from the free press. But our job is to seek the truth and hold power to account, regardless of who occupies the Oval Office.\n\u201cThat is what we have done during the Trump administration, just as we did in the Obama, Bush and Clinton administrations.

        "content": "Success of pro-Corbyn candidates marks clear shift to the left as party prepares in key marginals for possible snap election\nNew evidence of Labour\u2019s shift to the left has emerged as candidates backed by Unite and Momentum are set to dominate the battle for marginal seats in the next election.\nMore than a third of the candidates selected to fight marginals for Labour were backed by, or closely aligned with, the leftwing pressure group Momentum, while nearly half were backed by Unite, the union closest to Corbyn.\nLabour has chosen its candidates for 96 marginals \u2013 held by opposition-party MPs with majorities smaller than 10,000 \u2013 in preparation for a snap election. Should it win all of them, it would have a majority of 28 in parliament.\nThe figures, analysed by the Observer, show that the next raft of Labour MPs is set to be considerably more supportive of Corbyn and his wing of the party, as candidates further to the right are struggling to win selection contests. In total, Momentum endorsed 67 candidates in the 96 selections, winning with 37 of them, while Unite endorsed 73 candidates and won with 47.\nIn many cases, Momentum, Unite and other trade unions have rallied behind the same candidate \u2013 such as Greg Marshall in Broxtowe, the seat held by Anna Soubry with a majority of just 863, and Hannah O\u2019Neill in Milton Keynes South.\nBut in other areas they have thrown their weight behind opposing figures. In Truro and Falmouth, Unite-backed Jen Forbes beat Momentum\u2019s pick, Anna Gillett, for the selection.\nMomentum-backed candidates have won selections in several seats where Unite did not put forward a nomination. They include Tina McKay in Colchester, Laura McAlpine in Harlow and Jackie Schneider in Wimbledon.\nUnite runs a well-coordinated campaign to get its preferred candidates selected in target seats; nearly two-thirds of sitting Labour MPs are linked to the union. Momentum\u2019s operations, on the other hand, are patchy, with its head office and local branches sometimes endorsing different people. In Scarborough and Whitby, Steve Howley \u2013 who had the support of Unite and Momentum\u2019s head office \u2013 was defeated by Hugo Fearnley, who was backed by the local Momentum branch.\nCorbyn critics not backed by Momentum or Unite have won a handful of selection battles, including Peter Lamb in Crawley and Sally Keeble in Northampton North.\nAnalysis of the selections in 96 marginals reveals regional differences in Momentum\u2019s reach. Half the selected candidates in the east Midlands, the east of England, London, and Yorkshire and the Humber are closely linked to Momentum. The proportion falls to one-third in the south-west, south-east, north-west and West Midlands.\nIn Wales, just five selections for 12 marginal seats have been made, three of them backed by Unite and one by Momentum. In Scotland, where 18 selections have been made, nine were backed by Unite. Momentum and its affiliate the Campaign for Socialism are linked to several winning candidates in Scotland, including Matt Kerr in Glasgow South West, Rhea Wolfson in Livingston, and Cara Hilton in Dunfermline and West Fife.\nNationally, Momentum\u2019s campaigning is focused on the constituencies of leading Tories with narrow majorities. The most vulnerable targets are Justine Greening, Amber Rudd and Soubry, while others such as Iain Duncan Smith, Nicky Morgan and Boris Johnson will require larger swings.\nTwo-thirds of the candidates selected so far to contest marginals for Labour are women.\nA spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that Momentum-backed candidates have won in more than half of the selections we\u2019ve contested. We\u2019re proud to back a new generation of up-and-coming Labour MPs, including 24-year-old Ali Milani, campaigning to unseat Boris Johnson, and Faiza Shaheen, the working-class east Londoner running against Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green.\u201d",

It reported on one school which found that particulate pollution exceeded WHO guidelines in every classroom, with two more than three times over the limit.\nThe new nursery audits will target sources of indoor and outdoor pollution, with five of the 20 nurseries trialling new air filtration systems to test their effectiveness at reducing indoor pollution.\nThe audits will focus on reducing NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 \u2013 the most dangerous particulate \u2013 as research shows children exposed to these smaller pollution particles and gases are more likely to grow up with lung problems and develop asthma.\nThe UK has the worst level of asthma in Europe and there were a record number of deaths from the condition last year.\nAir pollution, which is linked to 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, can also cause a range of debilitating lifelong conditions from heart disease and strokes to dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s.\nDr Simon Lenton, a representative of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the very young were particularly at risk.\n\u201cInfants and children are more vulnerable as their lungs and brains are still developing,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren and infants spend many hours in nursery or at school and it is imperative we know what air pollutants they are exposed to and then take action to ensure the air they breathe is as pure as possible.\u201d\nThe new nursery audits follow similar schemes for primary schools in London earlier this year, which led to some schools taking action to close roads, upgrade their boilers, tackle engine idling and promote car sharing.\nKhan said: \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing measures to reduce pollution being introduced at the primary schools where we\u2019ve delivered audits. I\u2019m confident that by expanding this approach to nurseries we can move forward in our fight against London\u2019s filthy air and protect thousands of young children.\u201d",

        "content": "Thousands of Labour members have demanded their party oppose Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and back a second referendum over EU membership. The call comes before a key party gathering which will be held amid warnings that some are already ending their membership over the issue.\nThe pressure emerges as the biggest Brexit poll conducted since the referendum suggests support for Labour would fall significantly should it back or allow its MPs to back a Brexit agreement. More than 5,000 Labour members and supporters have contacted the party before its policy meeting of senior figures this week.\nLabour\u2019s national policy forum, which includes trade union bosses, senior party officials and shadow cabinet ministers, meets on Wednesday. Officials will offer testimony that local members are quitting over the party\u2019s refusal to oppose Brexit.\nOne submission, from the chair of Devizes Labour party, warns that members are resigning and threatening to resign \u201cbecause of Labour\u2019s reluctance to take a more proactive role in the campaign to force a people\u2019s vote on this issue\u201d. She warns: \u201cIf Labour now fails us on this there is likely to be a mass exodus of the activists we need to fight for Labour in nearby winnable constituencies.\u201d\nActivists point to the biggest ever Brexit poll, which shows that Labour\u2019s support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal or handed its MPs freedom to vote on such a deal. The YouGov poll of 25,000 voters for the People\u2019s Vote campaign found that Labour\u2019s support would then slump to 26% of the vote \u2013 lower than the 27.6% secured by Michael Foot in the party\u2019s disastrous 1983 election. Labour is currently committed to voting against May\u2019s deal, but has stopped short of opposing Brexit under different terms.\nThe poll, conducted over the Christmas break, suggested there was a majority in favour of a second referendum and against Brexit. Voters would prefer that they, rather than MPs, are given the final say by 53% to 47%, excluding those who said they did not know. It found that 54% back staying in the EU, while 46% back leaving, excluding those who did not know.\nA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cAs unanimously agreed at conference, if Theresa May\u2019s botched Brexit deal is voted down in parliament then a general election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference, if the Conservatives block a general election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.\u201d\nThere is huge pressure on Jeremy Corbyn and the PM as MPs prepare to return after the Christmas break, with the crucial vote on May\u2019s deal scheduled for a week on Tuesday. Some insiders are already expecting a further delay to the vote. Under one plan, MPs would pass an amendment suggesting the deal will only pass with further legal guarantees from the EU about the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d \u2013 which would keep the Irish border open but could tether Britain to the EU\u2019s customs union. It comes after a concerted push from some cabinet ministers to show Brussels what sort of compromise would be required to secure parliamentary support. Downing Street sources insisted last night that the vote on the Brexit deal would go ahead next week.\nIt has also emerged that Tory party members are favouring leading Brexiters as their preferred candidates to replace May. Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis are top of the party\u2019s grassroots list. The next leader is likely to take the lead role in negotiating Britain\u2019s long-term trading relationship with the EU.\nThe cluster of Brexiters at the top of members\u2019 wishlist is the latest sign of pressure May faces from the right. After May pledged not to fight the next election as leader, Tory members were asked to name their preferred successor by the Party Members Project, run by Queen Mary University, London, and Sussex University.\nJohnson, who has been a leading critic of May\u2019s deal since quitting as foreign secretary, topped the poll with 20%. Rees-Mogg, the leader of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, trailed in second on 15%, while Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary last year, scored 8%. However, 12% said they did not know who should be the next leader, so the field could yet open up should May manage to hold on for some time and new figures emerge as contenders.\nWorryingly for Remain supporters, home secretary Sajid Javid was the only figure who originally backed staying in the EU, among the top five names in the members\u2019 wishlist.\nMeanwhile, May has warned MPs of the risks they are taking with democracy and the livelihoods of their constituents by seeking either a second referendum or \u201ctheir particular vision\u201d of Brexit.\nWriting in the Mail on Sunday, the PM was also critical of Labour\u2019s approach under Corbyn, saying it was based on a \u201ccynical tissue of incoherence, designed to avoid difficult decisions\u201d.\nIn a message that appeared aimed at winning opposition support for her deal, she said that \u201cMPs of every party will face the same question when the division bell rings. It is a question of profound significance for our democracy and for our constituents.\n\u201cThe only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table.\u201d",

        "content": "The roll-out of the government\u2019s flagship welfare programme is to be overhauled amid dire warnings about its impact on the vulnerable, the Observer understands.\nAmber Rudd, work and pensions secretary, is to scrap plans for an imminent parliamentary vote allowing 3 million existing welfare claimants to be transferred to the controversial universal credit system. The move is expected to be part of a major rethink designed to quell concerns about the programme\u2019s roll-out and avoid a damaging Tory rebellion.\nRudd will now seek approval from MPs only for a pilot scheme that transfers just 10,000 people from the old to the new system \u2013 a system that has been blamed for pushing some to the brink of destitution. Only after the pilot has been assessed will MPs be asked to approve the full roll-out.\nA Whitehall source said that Rudd wanted \u201cuniversal credit to receive a fresh parliamentary mandate and be personally sure the system is working in the interests of every claimant\u201d.\nThe shift comes after a stream of concerns from charities, MPs and campaigners about the impact universal credit has had on claimants new to the benefits system, with claims that it has fuelled debt, homelessness and the use of food banks.\nFrank Field, chairman of the work and pensions select committee, which has raised a series of concerns about universal credit, said: \u201cThe government seems finally to have woken up to the human catastrophe that was waiting to happen under its ill-formed plans for moving people on to universal credit.\u201d\nThe proposed pilot scheme, which is expected to be announced in a speech this week, follows a new tone from Rudd since she took her post in November. She has signalled that she wants to make changes to universal credit and battle the Treasury for more resources, to ensure that it works properly and claimants do not have to wait weeks for their money. She has also indicated concerns about the impact of the system on women.\nHowever, the concession is unlikely to appease Labour, and some Tories said that Rudd had simply acknowledged she would never win a vote approving the \u201cmanaged migration\u201d of all existing welfare claimants. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party is calling for the entire universal credit programme, which rolls six working-age benefits into one monthly payment, to be paused and reviewed.\nThe limited pilot paves the way for the process to be further slowed should problems emerge. She has already told MPs that she will not rush to meet arbitrary timetables. The process, which is already six and a half years behind its original schedule, is due to be completed by the end of 2023.\nAll current universal credit claimants are people making new claims or those who have had a change in circumstances. The Whitehall source said: \u201cAmber has taken a no-holds-barred approach to reform \u2026. So she will move 10,000 claimants, and carefully monitor this, before returning to parliament to report on her findings and seek that fresh mandate for the full roll-out.\u201d\nThe source added: \u201cWe hope that all sides of the house will back her endeavours. The old system was not some golden age of welfare.\u201d\nField said: \u201cThe secretary of state deserves credit for revisiting these plans. As a next step, and in keeping with this new approach, it is essential for the government to proceed with \u2018managed migration\u2019 of people to universal credit only once it has proved to parliament that it will not push more vulnerable people to the brink of destitution.\u201d\nTorsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: \u201cThe final phase of the roll-out of universal credit is a huge challenge \u2026. It is sensible for Amber Rudd to pilot an approach and then make further improvements before pressing ahead. In the current political climate, delaying the final vote also removes a big headache for a government with quite enough difficult votes to try and win.\u201d\nPaul Farmer, head of the mental health charity Mind, said the move represented an important shift: \u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of people with mental health problems yet to move across to universal credit and we have been clear that pushing ahead with these plans would be catastrophic for people who are too unwell to navigate the complex and often bewildering process of making a new claim,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know what this pilot will look like, but we hope this signals that the government is finally listening and is willing to take disabled people\u2019s fears seriously \u2013 giving people who receive support from the benefits system the financial security they need to live full and independent lives. The only way to ensure people are moved over to universal credit safely is by ensuring they won\u2019t be left without income because they weren\u2019t able to make a new claim for a benefit which they\u2019ve already been found to be entitled to.\u201d",

He said there has been no official confirmation of a Russian press report claiming Paul Whelan was given a USB drive containing the names of people employed at a top secret state organisation.\nHe also said the Whelan family have not been given any new information about Paul since the US ambassador visited him in Lefortovo prison in Moscow, where he has been held since his arrest on 28 December.\nThe lawyer assigned to the prisoner does not speak English and Paul Whelan, who runs security for a Michigan auto parts firm and who was in Moscow to attend a wedding, only speaks a few words of Russian, his brother said.\nThere has been speculation that Whelan was arrested with the intention of exchanging him for Russians in prison in the US, such as Maria Butina, who pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to infiltrate Republican political circles. She is cooperating with federal prosecutors.\nOn Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry said a Russian had been detained the day after Whelan\u2019s arrest in the US Pacific territory of the Northern Mariana Islands and transferred to Florida.\nThe Russian man, Dmitry Makarenko, had been accused in federal court in June 2017 of conspiring to export defence articles, including night-vision scopes, from the US to Russia without approval.\nThe Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, dismissed suggestions that Whelan may be part of a prisoner swap. \u201cI see no reasons to raise this issue in context of exchanges,\u201d Ryabkov said, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cWe should undergo all the procedures needed in this situation.\u201d\nDavid Whelan said no official had mentioned the possibility of an exchange to him. \u201cThe family\u2019s focus is getting Paul home and whatever means we can use to do that I would support,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Toronto.\nPaul Whelan holds four passports \u2013 US, UK, Canadian and Irish \u2013 as he was born in Canada to British parents, moved to the US and served in the marines, and has an Irish grandfather. The four governments will coordinate how to handle the case over the next few days, David Whelan said. The US has so far taken the lead as his brother entered Russia on his US passport.\nDavid Whelan welcomed remarks in support of his brother by the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Friday, particularly his warning to Russia not to use its prisoner as a geopolitical pawn.\n\u201cI think Paul is perhaps a pawn in some larger scheme,\u201d David Whelan said. \u201cI think he was definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I think the question then becomes whether it is worth trying to dig into what the rationale is for why he was picked up.\u201d\nHe pointed to the coincidence that a domain name his brother once used, paulnwhelan.com, was purchased in November by an anonymous buyer using a Hong Kong IP address.\n\u201cWho would be buying paulnwhelan.com right out of the blue in the middle of November 2018, six weeks before the Russians pick Paul up for spying,\u201d David Whelan said. \u201cSo you have so many dots you can\u2019t possibly connect without more details.\u201d\nHe said he did not know what to make of allegations published in the Russian media outlet, Rosbalt, that his brother had cultivated contacts from the Russian defence and security services for a decade, and had been arrested in his hotel room with a USB drive containing classified information.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s difficult to know whether it\u2019s accurate or not,\u201d he said. \u201cI would feel more confident if it had come from the Russian government in an official statement. I don\u2019t understand why, over a week since he was detained, there is no rudimentary information on what happened, why he was picked up, what he was found with. Surely if that was available that would be relatively easy to release.\u201d\nHe said the family have had no contact with Vladimir Zherebenkov, the lawyer assigned to represent his brother, and is unsure how he came to be hired, as the US embassy only recommends English-speaking lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that he doesn\u2019t speak English, which is a little bit of surprise,\u201d he said.\nPaul Whelan speaks so little Russian that when US diplomats visited him on Wednesday he did not have his glasses, his brother said. He had not known how to ask for them in Russian and guards were not allowed to talk to him in English.\nThe family have set up an account which will allow Whelan to buy basics like toilet roll and razors in prison but, because of the Orthodox Christmas holiday, they have not been able to transfer funds.\nDavid Whelan said he had been unaware of his brother\u2019s interest in Russia. \u201cWhen we meet at my folks\u2019 house or when we email, Russia never comes up, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s banging on about it all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know I would have called him a Russophile.\u201d\nPaul Whelan had been in contact with Russians with military backgrounds through the social media website Vkontakte, but his brother said he saw nothing unusual in that.\n\u201cWithout the context of him sitting in a Russian jail, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s really that odd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he is on social media in touch with people with similar backgrounds, I don\u2019t find particularly surprising.\u201d",

        "content": "A Royal Academician has followed in the footsteps of JMW Turner and John Ruskin to capture in photographs the breathtaking sites in the French Alps that 19th-century artists caught so strikingly. The resulting images reveal a stark depiction of how climate change has taken its toll on the glaciated landscape.\nFor a forthcoming exhibition on Ruskin and Turner, Emma Stibbon was commissioned to go to Chamonix and record the glaciers around Mont Blanc where, in the early 1800s, Turner painted sublime watercolours that inspired Ruskin to embark on his Alpine tours decades later, photographing and drawing awe-inspiring glaciers such as the Mer de Glace.\nIn June, the same month in which Ruskin produced his daguerreotypes (early photographs) of the Mer de Glace more than 160 years ago, Stibbon found his viewpoint for her own images, using another early photographic process, cyanotype. While Turner and Ruskin observed the drama of a sea of ice almost at the level they stood, Stibbon looked down into an exposed deep valley with \u201ca dark moraine-covered floor, almost completely devoid of ice\u201d. She saID: \u201cIt\u2019s unrecognisable.\u201d\nHer commission forms part of the Ruskin, Turner & the Storm Cloud, exhibition opening at the York Art Gallery in March and Abbot Hall, Kendal, in July. It is part of a worldwide programme of exhibitions, conferences and publications to mark the 200th birthday of Ruskin, a writer, artist and social reformer whose achievements are sometimes eclipsed by scandals, including his ill-fated, unconsummated marriage to Effie Gray and a libel action brought by painter James McNeill Whistler. \u201cWhen we think of the Alps,\u201d said Stibbon, \u201cwe think of iconic white peaks. By the end of this century, there probably won\u2019t be any snow.\u201d\nShe added that Ruskin was ahead of his time in realising \u201cthe Industrial Revolution was affecting air quality and that air pollution was linked to the use of coal. He could see that glaciers move and I think he suspected that there was some [ice] recession, which would have been starting around that period in the 1850s.\u201d\nSuzanne Fagence Cooper, research curator at York Art Gallery and author of a new book, To See Clearly: Why Ruskin Matters, said Stibbon\u2019s images show the glacier retreat \u201cvery clearly\u201d, and capture a \u201csense of real loss\u201d.\nWhile Ruskin events extend to Japan and America, in the UK there is a cinema screening, from 22 February, of Effie Gray \u2013 the 2014 film written by Emma Thompson \u2013 and the exhibition, John Ruskin: The Power of Seeing, from 26 January at Two Temple Place, London. It features more than 190 exhibits revealing how Ruskin\u2019s influence is still felt.\nRobert Hewison, author of the recently published Ruskin and His Contemporaries, said: \u201cRuskin was, by the end of his life, treated as a kind of prophet \u2013 although not in his own country \u2013 for predicting both economic and ecological deterioration.

        "content": "Utah senator\u2019s criticisms raise prospect of a challenge in a party that has all but reshaped itself in Trump\u2019s image\nAt this week\u2019s solemn swearing in of the Senate, Vice-President Mike Pence worked his way along a line that included Mitt Romney, a Republican stalwart, Bernie Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist, and Kyrsten Sinema, the first openly bisexual senator. Just this once, Pence may have felt more at ease with Sanders or Sinema than with his fellow conservative.\nA day earlier, Romney had fired a broadside at the boss to whom Pence remains unswervingly loyal.\n\u201cThe Trump presidency made a deep descent in December,\u201d the incoming Utah senator wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cHis conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d\nRomney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, added: \u201cThe world is also watching. America has long been looked to for leadership \u2026 Trump\u2019s words and actions have caused dismay around the world.\u201d\nMuch was striking about the column, not least the way in which Romney bluntly made reference to \u201cTrump\u201d rather than \u201cPresident Trump\u201d. It was a rare stirring of rebellion in a party that has all but reshaped itself in Trump\u2019s image. The voice of dissent raised the question of whether the president will face a challenge in the Republican primaries ahead of the 2020 election.\nRomney\u2019s timing was a surprise, said strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to and spokesman for his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\n\u201cThe big question is, is this part of larger plan he has to build a broader coalition of voices that are going to confront the president on policies and rhetoric?\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the backlash was a testament to the fact that there is a fight in the party, but right now Trump is winning it.\u201d\nThe party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan is now the party of Trump. A former Democrat with few ideological positions, Trump hijacked the primaries in 2016 as the ultimate outsider, tearing into the Bush family, House speaker Paul Ryan, Senator John McCain and Romney himself. Trump defeated 16 more conventional candidates with a mix of nationalism, populism, xenophobia and celebrity, then repeated the trick to beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency.\nHe has arguably given Republicans bangs for their buck: two conservative justices on the supreme court, huge tax cuts for the rich, business regulations slashed. In return, many have turned a blind eye to his contempt for the free market, his willingness to run up the national debt and his embrace of foreign despots at the expense of allies.\nThis week, for example, Trump randomly declared: \u201cThe reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there.\u201d The statement would have shaken Reagan to the core but there was barely a murmur from a party that has something approaching Stockholm syndrome.\nMichael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cDonald Trump is the manifestation of this era of Republicanism and, by and large, Republicans have bought into that narrative, that storyline, that style of leadership. They just have to await the fate of the voting gods, otherwise known as citizens, who will cast the final judgment.\u201d\nEver fearful of the noisy Trump base, Republican opposition in the Senate has withered. McCain, a keeper of the flame of America\u2019s postwar global leadership, died from brain cancer in August. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both scathing critics who nevertheless generally voted for Trump\u2019s legislation, have retired. That leaves only Romney and Ben Sasse, a young senator from Nebraska who has proved willing to call out the president.\nThere is then a second tier of senators, such as Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado and James Lankford of Oklahoma, who have been known to make their displeasure clear, though none appears likely to lead an uprising.\nTed Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once bitter opponents of Trump, are now among his most ardent cheerleaders, although Graham savaged the recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Majority leader Mitch McConnell expressed dismay at the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, yet was careful to avoid directly rebuking the president.\nHenry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center think tank in Washington, said: \u201cA lot of people do the game of \u2018I disapprove of his tweets\u2019 but, when push comes to shove, they don\u2019t openly disagree with him. Mitt Romney has now put himself in the Ben Sasse camp rather than the Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz camp.\u201d\nIn the House of Representatives, Republicans are now in the minority but probably even more conservative and pro-Trump than before. Many moderates from suburban-heavy districts lost their seats in the midterms. Minority leader Kevin McCarthy has positioned himself as one of the president\u2019s closest lieutenants.\nThe Trump virus has spread to conservative media. Fox News not only lionises him and asks him soft questions but, in football terms, has become a feeder club for the White House. Rightwing broadcasters such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter have been influential in persuading Trump to keep the government partially shut down unless he gets money for a border wall. Conversely, the Weekly Standard, a neoconservative magazine that was a rallying point for Never Trumpers, closed down last month.\nThat is why Romney\u2019s column in the Post was seen by some as a candle flickering in the dark. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio and arch Trump critic, tweeted: \u201cWelcome to the fray, Mitt Romney.\u201d Bill Kristol, former editor of the Weekly Standard, wrote: \u201cFor now at least Mitt Romney has become the leader of the Republican Resistance to Trump.\u201d\nSteele said: \u201cI thought it was more than just a shot across the president\u2019s political bow. Essentially it created a crack in the wall that many inside the party have been creating around Trump that prevented members who would like to sidestep some of his crazy from doing it. He\u2019s provided a possible way forward in drawing some clear line distinctions between the character of the man and the policies of the administration.\u201d\nBut Steele cautioned against unrealistic expectations that Romney\u2019s conscience will spearhead a Republican rebellion any time soon.\n\u201cI think Ben Sasse will probably hold down that space largely by himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate Mitt Romney really being that vocal out of the box against the president. His problem, because he led off with this op-ed, is going to be when the president says something and \u2013 God help us \u2013 tweets something he\u2019s going to be the first one the press goes to for response. That\u2019s going to get old for him very quickly. He\u2019ll be mobbed in the corridors.\u201d\nOthers suggest that Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and business executive, is a flawed messenger. He launched a memorably stinging attack on Trump during the 2016 election but was subsequently photographed dining with him when in contention for the job of secretary of state. He was also content to accept Trump\u2019s support for his recent Senate run.\nOlsen said: \u201cIt damages his credibility among people he would need to persuade. He\u2019s moved back and forth. When he was up for secretary of state, Trump\u2019s character didn\u2019t seem to matter so much.\u201d\nRomney is also out of touch with Republican voters, Olsen argued. \u201cThe Republican party on policy is largely behind or significantly open to the kind of innovations Trump has proposed. Mitt Romney tried to put himself on the broad Trump-suspicious track, but anyone who wants to lead the Republican party can\u2019t pretend we live in 2005. Romney fell into that trap.\u201d\nTrump claimed this week that he is \u201cthe most popular president in the history of the Republican party\u201d. Eighty-nine percent of Republicans approve of his job performance, according to a Gallup survey last month, although just 39% of all Americans do, which is lower than any president in either party at this point in his presidency since at least 1954.\nTrump\u2019s grip on the 164-year-old party could be loosened in the coming year as a partial government shutdown drags on and he faces investigations and possible impeachment from a Democratic-controlled House, turbulence in the markets and the likely conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged collusion with Russia.\nThe president might face a challenge in the 2020 primaries, potentially from Flake, Kasich, Sasse or even Romney. Flake told CNN last week: \u201cSomebody does need to challenge the president. I\u2019m a long way from there, but somebody needs to and I think that the country needs to be reminded of what it means to be conservative, certainly on the Republican side, and what it means to be decent as well.\u201d\nOlsen said: \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if the president didn\u2019t have a primary challenge; he\u2019s too controversial. The only question is, is it moderately serious or purely quixotic?\n\u201cIf Trump were to die today, Republicans would still want a candidate who says many of the things he does and is willing to fight. The majority of the Republican party is broadly nationalistic and moderately populist. If Trump says, \u2018I\u2019ve achieved everything and I\u2019m not going to run again,\u2019 Republicans would want someone with the same positions, not a Sasse or a Romney.\u201d\nAs things stand, Trump would almost certainly win the primaries but could be mortally wounded. Primary challengers in 1980 and 1992 helped weaken incumbent presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush, both of whom went on to lose.\nCharlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cRight now it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s party but it would not be surprising if he did face a challenge from Republicans who are not drinking the Kool-Aid. It would be a tremendously difficult uphill climb. Trump would be overwhelmingly the favourite for the nomination. But that does not mean the case should not be made.\u201d",

        "content": "A tale of an unlikely pair of female people-traffickers in Morocco is gripping and intense\nIt was supposed to be a great adventure. But for the two young women, born in the Netherlands of African parents, and considered Dutch, their badly planned trip to Morocco, home of their forefathers, begins with some expensive minor bother with a rented car. It ends in a ghastly tragedy, which leaves at least one of the girls questioning her humanity.\nThe gifted Dutch writer Tommy Wieringa is a bold, intelligent stylist, unafraid of exposing the ugliness of society juxtaposed with the vagaries of human nature. In this taut, intense contemporary thriller of multiple exploitations, he initially appears to be studying the dynamics of a young female friendship set against the broader theme of cultural assimilation.\nTough, sexually confident \u2013 and liberated \u2013 Thouraya, a beautician, considers herself to be an independent European woman. She is streetwise, sort of. Her sidekick, Ilham, is a good deal more tentative; she worries about her body shape and fears that although living in Holland, she will still end up as a traditional Moroccan wife. Either way, these girls each have two passports: \u201cThey were the children of two kingdoms, they carried the green passport of the Royaume du Maroc and the red-lead one of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but in both countries they were, above all, foreigners.\u201d\nSoon after their arrival in Morocco, besieged by flies, filth and poverty, they discover, even as tourists, the difficulty of ordinary existence for unaccompanied women. They are overcharged at the garage for poor-quality repairs and are annoyed. Then help appears to be at hand in Saleh, a wheeler-dealer with a jail record back in Holland. But he knows how to navigate life between Africa and Europe.\nA saviour, they think, particularly as Thouraya\u2019s Moroccan-based carpet dealer uncle resents giving the girls money and they need help to get home. \u201cHe was a dripping faucet that refused to open all the way; they didn\u2019t dare ask for more.\u201d Saleh takes charge of the girls. He has a plan; and, he claims, it always works.\nWithin a few minutes of Saleh bringing the girls to a shabby neighbourhood where they visit a poor family and are served refreshments, the proposal is outlined while a child, oblivious to the discussion, watches a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The old woman of the house, who probably isn\u2019t that old, begs the girls to take her 19-year-old son Murat back with them. He had previously worked in France but had been deported. In Morocco there is nothing for him. The girls are horrified as it dawns on them that slick, fixer Saleh, with the winning smile, is a con man trafficking in migrants desperate to get to Europe.\nBrilliantly well paced and edgy, the book is translated with characteristic astuteness by Sam Garrett, the narrative interspersed with sharp dialogue \u2013 mainly exchanges between the two girls \u2013 which always convinces as a shorthand between old friends. The story unfolds like a movie with the pair bending under pressure; the worldly Thouraya is the first to break. Once she realises that this is a business transaction, not a favour, she agrees. It is a two-hour crossing back to Europe by ferry, docking at a Spanish port. Two hours in the boot of their car. Nothing can go wrong, says Saleh. Ilham continues to object, while Saleh counters nastily, until, finally, \u201cIlham gave in\u201d.\nThis heartstopping novella is a darker variation of Wieringa\u2019s equally superb novel These Are the Names (2012), also translated by Garrett, and again about migrants. But the full mercilessness of the migrant dilemma is confronted here to devastating effect. A mid-sequence shift to the continuous present tense sustains the tension. \u201cThe ship\u2019s deep heartbeat slows.\u201d It proves ominous. Murat\u2019s agony is revealed. Saleh immediately abandons the girls.\nFrom this point the writing acquires a surreal intensity. Wieringa continues to explore the essential differences between the two girls. They bicker and panic. All the while, Murat remains a deathly presence as the rented car races across the arid Spanish landscape, in the heat, while the odour of decay intensifies. The powerful language proves equal to the story\u2019s chilling moral profundity and all involved appear that bit smaller and meaner.\n Eileen Battersby, author and former chief literary critic of the Irish Times, died on 23 December, aged 60, following a car crash in County Meath the previous day. Richard Ford, Michael Ondaatje and Edmund White are among the writers who have paid tribute to the hugely influential critic, a four-time winner of the National Arts Journalist of the Year award.\n The Death of Murat Idrissi by Tommy Wieringa is published by Scribe (\u00a312.99).

        "content": "Why do we really get fat? And what can we do about it? Known for his attacks on the diet industry, \u2018Angry Chef\u2019 Anthony Warner is now shattering some of the myths about obesity\nSometimes, journalists have been heard to wonder if the moniker under which the so-called Angry Chef has blogged since 2015 is ironic. Before they meet Anthony Warner, they expect the character they encounter online: a choleric type whose white apron, metaphorically speaking, is liberally splattered with the blood of the charlatans and pseudo-scientists he spends his time so furiously pulling apart. But then in he walks, a quietly spoken, dorky-looking bloke with a neatly trimmed beard and distinctly non-architectural glasses, and disappointment rises inside them like a pan coming to the boil. Is he about to yell the F-word in their faces? No, he is not. He is just going to go on \u2013 and on \u2013 about such things as genes and hormones and the difference between a simple problem and a complex one.\nIs his temperament really so placid? I\u2019m not at all sure it is. Warner, a former chef who went on to work as a development cook at Premier Foods, owner of brands such as Oxo and Mr Kipling, certainly has a careful, almost pedantic way of talking; his determination to avoid generalisations when it comes to talking about diet means he can be both somewhat verbose and a little humourless. He doesn\u2019t swear anything like as a much as his alter-ego. Nevertheless, it\u2019s pretty easy to wind him up. All sorts of things seem to make him irritated, including me. On the quiet \u2013 actually, not even on the quiet \u2013 he\u2019s a massive inverted snob, always on the look-out for perceived slights against processed food and takeaways. When, for instance, I tell a funny (ish) story about how Marco Pierre White became furious when I revealed to him in an interview that I often make my own stock \u2013 White, the original angry chef, was then the face of Knorr cubes \u2013 Warner seems to grow just a little taller in his seat. \u201cWell, I get equally upset when people demean others for using products,\u201d he says. Hang on! I didn\u2019t demean anyone. \u201cNo, but to have a society where people are made to feel guilty for making a pasta bake from a jar\u2026\u201d He picks up his knife and fork, and silently sets about attacking the food on his plate.\nWarner, who lives in Nottinghamshire, meets me for lunch at a restaurant in London where he has schnitzel with pommes aligot \u2013 a dish that is surely anathema to many, if not most, of the exasperatingly wrong-headed dietary \u201cexperts\u201d who first induced him to begin writing his blog, given that it combines mashed potato with cheese to such powerfully alluring effect. But alas, once his order arrives, he all but ignores it for 20 minutes or so. The trouble is that his new book, which we are here to discuss, is on such tricky, nuanced territory, talking about it demands his full attention. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-bogglingly complex,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started my research, even I wasn\u2019t sure where I was going. The only thing I knew for certain was people were over-simplifying, and this is a subject that completely defies simple explanation.\u201d\nWarner\u2019s first book, The Angry Chef: Bad Science and the Truth about Healthy Eating, took apart every diet and food fad it\u2019s possible to imagine; on the receiving end of his rage were, among other things, detoxing and the kind of nutritional nonsense purveyed by the likes of the Hemsley sisters, \u201cDeliciously Ella\u201d Mills and others who worship at the shrine of coconut oil. But these were, as he readily admits, pretty easy targets. His new book, The Truth About Fat, is altogether less focused in the sense that it is impossible to say, precisely, why levels of obesity may be rising, or what, if anything, can and should be done about this. Having waded through a lot of scientific papers and spoken to some of the world\u2019s leading experts in this field, all Warner knows for sure is that body weight should not be defined, as it is now, as a behaviour \u2013 like smoking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the outcome of an enormously complicated set of circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cThis idea that willpower plays a part, that the overweight have some kind of personality deficit\u2026 Look at the evidence: that\u2019s a ridiculous position to take. It\u2019s just not true, and yet we\u2019re conditioned to believe it is.\u201d If his book has a message, then, it is that fat shaming, in all its various guises, must end. Calorie-reduction diets for weight loss do not, he writes in his book, work for the majority of people. Carbohydrates are not the enemy, and nor is sugar. Yet still we continue to regard those who are overweight as lazy and greedy (visibly overweight people are, among other things, less likely to be promoted at work, and more likely to be convicted of a crime by a jury) \u2013 cue even more misery for them as they embark on yet another regime that will inevitably fail. Why, he asks, are we not kinder? If we knew the facts, we surely would be. \u201cThe most shocking statistic I learned while I was writing the book was about binge-eating disorder in bariatric surgery populations,\u201d he says. \u201cFifty per cent of those who have this surgery [a procedure that tackles obesity by reducing the size of the stomach] suffer from it, a condition that is very strongly associated with childhood trauma. It\u2019s an expression of complex mental health problems.\u201d Bariatric surgery, he believes, does help a great many people. But it still amazes him that the case against it isn\u2019t made more often:.\u201cIf this was a drug, one that killed one in 200 people who took it, it wouldn\u2019t get anywhere near being prescribed.\u201d\nWarner has trouble with current definitions of obesity. He thinks body mass index, a number calculated by dividing a person\u2019s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres, is too blunt a tool to be helpful (you tip from being overweight to being obese if your BMI is between 30 and 35). When, in 1997, the World Health Organisation moved the BMI of a person of normal weight from 27 to 25, millions of people woke up to find they had a health problem; he believes this change was based on questionable data. More significantly, he questions the notion of an \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d. Such language is unhelpful, not least because it suggests the race is on for a single \u201ccure\u201d when no such thing exists. Moreover, while populations may well be putting on weight, there is evidence to suggest that obesity, far from being an epidemic, has mostly affected only a small number of vulnerable individuals.\nThe factors involved in weight gain are so multifarious, and interconnected in such complex and still elusive ways, it\u2019s all but impossible to summarise them (for all Warner\u2019s efforts to be as clear as possible for the lay reader, the 330 pages of his book are probably best described as chewy). Over lunch, I have a go at getting him to talk about some of these in a single sentence or so. Sometimes, he\u2019s able to do it. Sometimes, he simply can\u2019t. On the subject of genes, for instance, the evidence is (relatively) straightforward: \u201cBody weight is one of the most inherited characteristics ever studied,\u201d he says. \u201cGenetics accounts for around 70% of the reasons why someone might become fat.\u201d But when we move to hormones things get radically more complicated. \u201cHistorically, the biggest threat to human beings has been starvation. We have a system in place, and when our body thinks it\u2019s not getting enough food, that hormonal system kicks in. It is almost impossible to override. It\u2019s as powerful as the desire to breathe.\u201d If he talked me through this system now, we\u2019d probably still be here at dinnertime.\nOn exercise, he notes that even if people are more sedentary than in the past \u2013 he\u2019s not sure that we are \u2013 it is nevertheless quite difficult to expend more calories than you consume. \u201cWe\u2019d have to run for an hour and a half to burn off the meal we\u2019re eating now,\u201d he says, eyeing my steak and chips. If we exercised more, it would, he thinks, make a huge difference to our health \u2013 to our mental health, and to the composition of our bodies in terms of muscle \u2013 but not necessarily to our weight. Nor is he into the idea of, say, banning takeaways from operating in the vicinity of schools. \u201cIt would be better if we could work with businesses to improve their food. Lots of fried chicken joints are still using hydrogenated vegetable oil. It would be easy to ban that, without any impact on the quality of their food.\u201d His hunch is that those who are keen on takeaway bans simply find it \u201cdistasteful that young people like to hang out in them\u2026 It\u2019s a culturally driven thing.\u201d\nWarner, the son of a Hertfordshire accountant who fell into working as a chef having enjoyed the kitchen jobs he did as a biochemistry student in Manchester, famously believes that processed food can have the same value as any other kind of food; that we\u2019re wrong to think something made from scratch is \u201cbetter\u201d or healthier. So does he cook from scratch at home? (He and his partner have a young daughter.) \u201cSometimes. But I worry about talking about how I cook. What works in my life might not fit into someone else\u2019s.\u201d When, after 20 years as a chef, he began working at Premier Foods (now he\u2019s a writer, he still consults), it was fascinating to learn what \u201cchallenges\u201d people faced when cooking at home. \u201cI spent a lot of time doing focus groups and going to people\u2019s houses, and most people know more than we give them credit for. They do know how to roast a chicken \u2013 and even if they don\u2019t, the reasons for that won\u2019t change unless their socio-economic conditions change. The number of times I\u2019ve heard celebrity chefs tell people to buy a cheap cut of meat and slow cook it! Those recipes are written by someone who has no idea what it\u2019s like to have to watch your electricity.\u201d I have the impression he believes a special place in hell is reserved for those people \u2013 I\u2019m not sure who they are, but he certainly seems to think they do exist \u2013 who believe the problem of obesity would be solved virtually overnight if only everyone knew how \u201cto make their own hummus\u201d.\nStill, all this surely leaves us with a problem. If the message does eventually get through that diets and exercise don\u2019t work, and that a lot of our trouble lies with our genes, then why would anyone bother to do anything at all to change their lifestyle? Warner doesn\u2019t exactly have an answer to this, beyond telling me he hopes only to help people accept complexity in the matter of weight gain, that we need better information and fewer false prophets, and to insist that, no, he really doesn\u2019t wish to downplay the notion we do have a problem with obesity. \u201cI know this will be framed as: \u2018You don\u2019t care about the health of the nation, you only care about your pay masters at big food.\u2019 But I do think there are serious problems, even if they\u2019re not necessarily the ones people think.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not sure the message will ever get through. Just look at me: I\u2019ve read his book, yet still I\u2019m asking my naughty Protestant questions about self-control (not to mention telling him how I like to get off the bus a stop earlier, the better to try and shrink my bum). And he\u2019s just as bad, in a way. As he\u2019s perfectly willing to admit, if he ever began to get fat, he would almost certainly embark on a diet himself. (Warner has, incidentally, always been slim \u2013 something that, thanks to his genes, has never involved any effort on his part.) It is, he says, part of the human condition that we cling to ideas we know in our hearts to be worthless; to narratives that are little more than the result of a certain kind of brainwashing. In this sense, he\u2019s every bit as human as some of those he is apt to attack. \u201cWe want short cuts,\u201d he says. \u201cWe look at a diet, and we think: that looks OK. I only have to cut out this or that. And so we try it.\u201d He eats the last morsel of schnitzel. Unsurprisingly, given the turn of our conversation, it seems to give him no pleasure at all.\nThe Truth About Fat (Oneworld, \u00a314.99) is published on 10 January.

        "content": "Question: when will the City witness the revival of Marks & Spencer? Answer: in about five years\u2019 time.\nThis is not a scoop. \u201cAbout five years\u201d tends to be the answer every time the question about the Resurrection of St Michael is asked, and it gets refreshed almost as often as the retailer\u2019s fashion lines.\nMarc Bolland (chief executive, May 2010 to April 2016) started his tenure by announcing a three-year turnaround strategy. That worked out so well that (a) he had to keep extending the deadline and (b) when Steve Rowe took his place in 2016, the new boss was greeted by the headline: \u201cHow can new M&S boss Steve Rowe end five years of clothing decline?\u201d\nRowe\u2019s answer was a fresh scheme designed for 2016, which seemed to involve sticking the word \u201cnew\u201d in front of the words \u201cfive-year plan\u201d. Still, Rowe\u2019s version had swifter results than Bolland\u2019s, with its timeframe needing to be revised even more quickly.\nJust 19 months after Rowe\u2019s appointment and two months after the arrival of new chairman Archie Norman, the 2016 five-year plan was deemed fashionable enough to be launched as the 2017 five-year plan.\n\u201cThe business still has many structural issues to tackle as we embark on the next five years of our transformation, in the context of a very challenging retail and consumer environment,\u201d Rowe said in November 2017, before adding a punchline: \u201cToday we are accelerating our plans to build a business with sustainable, profitable growth, making M&S special again.\u201d Very droll, Mr Rowe.\nStill, this week sees a rather important moment for retailer\u2019s current boss and its rolling five-year recovery. The company will report its Christmas trading figures on Thursday amid a retailing environment even more austere than a pair of Marks & Spencer underpants.\nHigh streets have had a desperate Christmas, and even the retailers who actually know what they are doing seemed only to have been saved by a late surge in online sales.\nLast week M&S\u2019s great rival, Next, unveiled a high-street performance that was weaker than expected, with sales down 9.2%. Its online figures, however, jumped 15.2%. Worryingly for M&S, the company has rarely shown itself to be in the vanguard of new things \u2013 online included.\nAll of which suggests that there is something fundamentally wrong with the M&S business model that might go beyond the odd chief executive and revolving senior management teams, although inevitably personalities will be the focus again this time.\nLast week Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, remarked: \u201cThe vultures are clearly gathering outside M&S headquarters and poor Steve [Rowe] is the obvious guy to blame for the disastrous Christmas trading\u201d. If that sounds brutal, then M&S does not exactly appear to be working overtime to dispel such sentiments.\nThere seems to have been a mini-takeover of M&S by Asda alumni. Obviously there is chairman Norman, whose stellar reputation was secured by saving the grocer and selling it to US giant Walmart in the 1990s.\nHe added former Sainsbury\u2019s boss (and erstwhile Asda and M&S exec) Justin King to the board last month, while another ex-Asda exec, Stuart Machin, joined as M&S\u2019s managing director of food last spring.\nThere is open speculation that King could step in as interim boss if Rowe were ousted \u2013 albeit in a move that would breach corporate governance guidelines. Still, such a move would only be temporary. Much like one of the retailer\u2019s recovery formulas.",

Officials take to the airwaves each day to wax lyrical about Socialist party support schemes for expectant mothers and the poor.\nOne recent propaganda video boasted: \u201cIf there is one area where you feel and live the achievements of the Bolivarian revolution, it\u2019s precisely in the field of healthcare, from which Venezuelan men and women were excluded for so many decades.\u201d\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed earlier this year: \u201cThe people\u2019s health is our priority.\u201d\nA visit to the hospital where Victoria Mart\u00ednez spent her final days suggests otherwise.\nThe burns unit is filled with bandaged toddlers who have stumbled into wood fires or been burned by kerosene lamps \u2013 increasingly common sources of fuel and light.\nIn the paediatric ward upstairs, mothers nurse emaciated babies \u2013 socks dangling from their tiny ankles, bones protruding through their flesh \u2013 who cannot be hydrated because the hospital cannot even provide a catheter.\nOne doctor asked: \u201cWhat blame do these children have for having been born into the wrong era?\u201d\nMisael Mart\u00ednez said he did not fault the hospital\u2019s overstretched doctors for his daughter\u2019s premature death: they had treated her \u201clike a princess\u201d.\nBut he described hospital conditions so precarious that his family had been asked to provide not only their own medicines, latex gloves and syringes, but also the cleaning products and water used to scrub down Victoria\u2019s ward.\nExperts say Venezuela\u2019s health service improved in the first decade of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Bolivarian revolution, which started 20 years ago this month. Life expectancy rose and infant mortality rates fell as high oil prices allowed the country with the world\u2019s greatest crude reserves to hurl resources at public healthcare, the Lancet medical journal noted earlier this year. Tens of thousands of Cuban doctors arrived to staff community \u201cmissions\u201d that the government said were bringing free healthcare to the masses.\nBut that flagship programme has reportedly been brought to its knees by Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse, placing even greater strain on the country\u2019s already buckling hospital network. In November Human Rights Watch warned of Venezuela\u2019s \u201cdevastating health crisis\u201d, pointing to increasing rates of maternal and infant mortality and a spike in cases of measles, diphtheria, tuberculosis and malaria.\nAnother recent report noted that 53% of Venezuelan operating theatres were now closed, 71% of emergency rooms could not provide regular services and 79% of hospitals lacked a reliable water supply.\nMeanwhile, medical professionals were joining a historic exodus overseas: at least 22,000 Venezuelan doctors \u2013 55% of the total \u2013 reportedly abandoned the country between 2012 and 2017.\nLesbia Cortez, a healthcare worker at the Catholic charity C\u00e1ritas, said: \u201cThere are virtually no specialists left.\u201d She estimated that 70% of those she studied with at medical school now practised in Colombia, Argentina or Chile.\nShe said: \u201cYou can\u2019t find a endocrinologist because they\u2019ve gone; a dermatologist because they\u2019ve gone; an oncologist because they\u2019ve gone. The people who work in the dialysis units aren\u2019t there because they\u2019ve left the country too.\u201d\nAlberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor who recently returned to Venezuela from the United States to form a research group that studies the resurgence of vaccine-preventable and endemic diseases caused by the crisis, said: \u201cI predict there is a moment when you are just going to be left without healthcare personnel in this country.\n\u201cIf a medical school faculty member earns $20 a month, what can you expect?\u201d\nPadilla, the campaigner for chronic patients, said she believed Venezuela\u2019s leaders should be jailed \u201cfor the crimes against humanity being committed\u201d because of a breakdown critics blame partly on the chavista \u201cmissions\u201d that channeled resources away from public hospitals.\nPadilla, 45, whose kidneys failed from hypertension, said she had spent three years on a transplant list but was now waiting to die since a lack of doctors and equipment meant operations were not possible: \u201cMy life is in danger in Venezuela.\u201d\nSusana M\u00fajica, who also suffers from kidney disease, grew angry as she considered Maduro\u2019s cheery depiction of Venezuelan health.\nShe said: \u201cHe says in his broadcasts that nothing\u2019s going on: that everything\u2019s fine; that there is medicine; that there are doctors; that I-don\u2019t-know-how-many-millions are being invested in healthcare. That this is [the result of] an economic war.\n\u201cWe know the reality. It is crystal clear to us because we are the ones living this reality every day \u2026 Whether we live or die isn\u2019t important to them. Their priority is staying in power.\u201d\nMart\u00ednez, Victoria\u2019s grieving father, said he was still struggling to accept his daughter\u2019s death but was determined to speak out in the hope of avoiding more needless deaths. He said: \u201cI know that no one can bring back my daughter. But I know I have neighbours in this hospital, and cousins. I have friends who go to this hospital because they have nowhere else to go and so this is my struggle.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m going to fight because I believe justice will come. And because I still believe that something will happen, that Venezuela will change, and that all this will pass.\u201d\nAdditional reporting Patricia Torres and Clavel Rangel",

        "content": "The award-winning atmospheric scientist on the urgency of the climate crisis and why people are her biggest hope\nKatharine Hayhoe is an atmospheric scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. She has contributed to more than 125 scientific papers and won numerous prizes for her science communication work. In 2018 she was a contributor to the US National Climate Assessment and was awarded the Stephen H Schneider award for outstanding climate science communication.\nIn 2018, we have seen forest fires in the Arctic circle; record high temperatures in parts of Australia, Africa and the US; floods in India; and devastating droughts in South Africa and Argentina. Is this a turning point? \n  This year has hit home how climate change loads the dice against us by taking naturally occurring weather events and amplifying them. We now have attribution studies that show how much more likely or stronger extreme weather events have become as a result of human emissions. For example, wildfires in the western US now burn nearly twice the area they would without climate change, and almost 40% more rain fell during Hurricane Harvey than would have otherwise. So we are really feeling the impacts and know how much humanity is responsible.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its 1.5C report in October. A month later, the US federal government\u2019s climate assessment \u2013 to which you contributed \u2013 came out. How did these two massive studies move our understanding along? \n  These assessments are important because there is a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat element to studying climate impacts. The act of observing affects the outcome. If people aren\u2019t aware of what is happening, why would anyone change? Assessments like these provide us with a vision of the future if we continue on our current pathway, and by doing so they address the most widespread and dangerous myth that the largest number of us have bought into: not that the science isn\u2019t real, but rather that climate change doesn\u2019t matter to me personally.\nCompared to past studies, how much media attention did these reports receive?\n There was significant coverage but a lot of media survive by generating controversy so they bring on opposing voices rather than explaining the scientific facts. Climate change shouldn\u2019t be fodder for commentators who represent the interests of the fossil fuel industry by muddying the science. As a human and a scientist, this focus on controversy is frustrating. A thermometer is not liberal or conservative.\nAre there any signs that public opinion is shifting in the US and elsewhere? \n  We haven\u2019t yet reached the tipping point to motivate sufficient action. But there has been a change. Ten years ago, few people felt personally affected by climate change. It seemed very distant. Today, most people can point to a specific way climate affects their daily lives. This is important because the three key steps to action are accepting that climate change is real, recognising it affects us, and being motivated to do something to fix it. Opinion polls in the US show 70% of people agree the climate is changing, but a majority still say it won\u2019t affect them.\nTrump was dismissive of these reports and has repeatedly tried to deny any link between climate change and extreme weather. What are the politics behind this denial? \n It\u2019s a vicious cycle. The more doom-filled reports the scientists release, the stronger the pushback from politicians whose power, ideology and funding depends on maintaining the status quo, and who are supported by those who fear the solutions to climate change more than they fear its impacts. Opposition to climate change is a symptom of a society that is politically polarised between those who cling to the past and those who recognise the need for a better future. Fossil fuels have brought us many benefits \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful for their contribution to my life \u2013 but the solution to our current crisis is to stop using them. That change can be scary, especially for those with most to lose financially from this shift. If you feel threatened, the instinctive reaction is to push back.\nProgress of sorts was made at the UN climate talks in Poland, though many scientists say global society is not moving fast enough. What is your take? \n  Progress was made in Poland as the world agreed on a rule book to implement the Paris agreement. The agreement is like a global pot luck in which every nation brings something different to the party. For some it\u2019s soil conservation, for another wind power or carbon pricing. Poland gave us an agreed common standard on how to measure these contributions. That was progress. As scientists, we are like physicians for the planet who have been monitoring its rising fever for 80 years. We know that our lifestyle, specifically our dependence on fossil fuels is the cause of a problem that is rapidly becoming serious and in some cases even dangerous. So when we see the world dragging its heels and carbon emissions continuing to grow, we become concerned, anxious, and even frustrated. We know we aren\u2019t changing fast enough.\nOn current trends, if you had to give a percentage breakdown of the likelihood of the following three outcomes by 2100, what would you give: a) keeping to 1.5C; b) keeping to 2C; c) rising above 3C; and d) overshooting 4C?\n I\u2019d put my money on a gradual bend away from a higher scenario, which is where we are now, until accumulating and worsening climate disasters eventually lead to a collective \u201coh shit!\u201d moment, when people finally realise climate impacts do pose a far greater threat than the solutions. At that point, I would hope the world would suddenly ramp up its carbon reduction to the scale of a Manhattan Project or a moon race and we would finally be able to make serious progress. The multitrillion-dollar question is simply when that tipping point in opinion will come, and whether it will be too late for civilisation as we know it. I hope with all my heart that we stay under 1.5C, but my cynical brain says 3C. Perhaps the reality will be somewhere between my head and my heart at 2C.\nWhat is the best way out of the climate crisis? What policies would make a difference? \n The most important thing is to accelerate the realisation that we have to act. This means connecting the dots to show that the impacts are not distant any more: they are here and they affect our lives. It also means talking about solutions. The technology and knowledge are there. The economics already make sense. In Texas, where I live, the biggest military base, Fort Hood, switched last year to renewables because they were cheaper than natural gas. And finally, it means weaning ourselves off fossil fuels, which is challenged by the fact that the majority of the world\u2019s richest companies have made their money from the fossil fuel economy \u2013 so the majority of the wealth and power remains in their hands.\nAre there any climate engineering schemes or trials that have potential? \n  One solution being discussed is the idea of deliberately geoengineering the planet to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and/or cool the planet. I believe it is important to discuss and study these technologies very thoroughly, because implementing some of them, like solar radiation management [spraying particles into the air to simulate a volcanic eruption and block some of the sunlight reaching Earth], is extremely risky. It would be like giving an experimental drug to every human on the planet before it had been tested. I\u2019m more hopeful about smaller scale, less risky geoengineering projects that suck carbon dioxide out of the air, such as those being trialled by Climeworks to turn carbon into stone or fuel: or even massive tree-planting efforts, as in Bhutan.\nWhat\u2019s the role of global finance? Can money managers, shareholders and multinationals exert pressure and take positive action in ways that short-termist, vote-hungry politicians seem unable to do? \n Yes! In the world we live in, money speaks loudly. Thanks to the growing divestment movement, we have seen cities, universities and entire countries, in the case of Ireland, withdrawing investments from fossil fuel assets. This isn\u2019t only happening for ethical reasons but for practical ones as well. As clean energy continues to expand, those assets could become stranded. When money talks the world listens.\nWhat are the most positive developments you have seen in the past year in the climate field? \n  I\u2019m asked what gives me hope on a daily basis, and my answer is, I don\u2019t find hope in my science, I find it in people. Over the last few years, the number of people who want to talk about and do something about climate has increased exponentially. Then, there is the unexpected leadership of organisations such as Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, RepublicEN, the Iron and Earth group \u2013 young professionals in the oil and construction industries who want to be part of the move from fossil fuels; and the take-up of renewables even in conservative states like Texas, which now gets 20% of its energy from wind and solar power.\nFinally, there\u2019s the encouraging news such as solar being the fastest-growing power source around the world, clean energy jobs growing from India to the US, and new technology being developed every year that drops the price and increases the accessibility of fossil fuel alternatives.\nThis year has also seen the rise of disruptive campaigning, for example Extinction Rebellion in the UK; the student strikes led by Greta Thunberg; and direct action in the US and Canada against oil pipelines. Is there a point when scientists also have to speak out more forcefully? \n  We are moving in that direction. Scientists are not just disembodied brains floating in a glass jar, we are humans who want the same thing every other human wants, a safe place to live on this planet we call home. So while our work must continue to be unbiased and objective, increasingly we are raising our voices, adding to the clear message that climate change is real and humans are responsible, the impacts are serious and we must act now, if we want to avoid the worst of them.\n\nWhat are the key political moments in 2019 for climate policy in the US and the world? \n International talks are important but we should be looking at subnational actors because there is a lot going on at the city and corporate level. Across the US a hundred cities have committed to going 100% clean energy. Companies like Apple have already achieved that goal. In the US there\u2019s a new climate bill with bipartisan sponsors, which is essential for legislation to succeed long-term.\nAre we likely to get any respite from climate change? \n (Sighs.) Climate change is a long-term trend superimposed over natural variability. There\u2019ll be good and bad years, just like there are for a patient with a long-term illness, but it isn\u2019t going away. To stabilise climate change, we have to eliminate our carbon emissions. And we\u2019re still a long way away from that.",

        "content": "After years of boom, Apple looks set for a rockier road in 2019 \u2013 partly through faults of its own and partly through social and economic factors that are affecting all the big smartphone manufacturers.\nThe company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, laid the blame for a shock cut in sales forecasts \u2013 and the subsequent share price tumble \u2013 on the economic downturn in China. A convenient excuse, but far from the whole picture.\nThe root of Apple\u2019s troubles is that its key developed markets, including the US, EU and South Korea, have all hit smartphone saturation point. With few first-time buyers left, sales rely on persuading those with often perfectly usable phones to upgrade, which is a much harder task.\nUsers are now holding on to their phones for as long as three or four years, meaning something has to change. While maintaining competitive products to keep rivals at bay, you either have to launch something radically different (an incredibly hard task), push the price of your phones up, seek out still-growing markets or shift to a services-based revenue stream to wring more money out of existing users (think the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud storage, Apple Music and the like).\nApple is doing all of the above. The trouble is that two of these strategies clash. By jacking up the cost of its best handsets to \u00a31,000 or more, it has effectively priced itself out of the mass market in India, leaving China as its only hope of significant growth in sales volume and users. But China is different from Apple\u2019s tried-and-tested markets.\nWhen your lives are run through an app that is device- and platform-agnostic, then the brand and operating system of the phone does not matter. The playing field is levelled, and there is no customer lock-in provided by exclusive services such as iMessage or Apple Pay. That is Apple\u2019s problem in China, where WeChat serves as the app not only for chat, but also for access to the government and news, conducting business, hiring cabs and purchasing goods.\nWhen rivals are releasing phones of similar quality and at significantly cheaper prices, then Apple asking as much as \u00a31,000 or more for its top products is hard to swallow in the west, let alone in China.\nFurthermore, Apple is doing the right thing by its customers by offering cost-effective battery replacements and software support that lasts up to five years. That, combined with high prices, risks encouraging buyers to hang on to their old handsets for longer.\nThat\u2019s not to say Apple isn\u2019t in a good position. Its services push is providing meaningful revenue that almost matched that from Mac desktop and iPad sales combined in 2018. However, services revenue does need to become a priority sooner than the company might have anticipated: it faces stiff competition from Google, Spotify and others even on its own phones. Selling accessories such as the Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods \u2013 meaning it can earn money outside the iPhone upgrade cycle \u2013 is also a smart move.\nThe trouble is that the recorded 59% of Apple revenue driven directly by iPhone sales hides the fact that its services revenue also overwhelmingly relies on the iPhone as the conduit. So while Apple must seek to extend sales as much as possible, it\u2019s critical for it to maintain its current 1.3-billion-plus user base if services are to become the main driver of revenue.\nThe road will certainly be rocky for Apple over the next few years, with choices to be made over strategy and pricing for developing markets that seem to be at odds with its approach in developed markets. And all bets are off if we sink into a US-China trade war.\nBut away from direct sales, it stands in a stronger position than its rivals, including Samsung and Huawei. None of the major manufacturers have as many lines of service revenue as Apple; the lion\u2019s share of the money from digital goods on Android smartphones outside of China goes to Google, not the phone makers.\nFat Cat Friday was an attempt by the High Pay Centre to publicise the shocking gap between the pay of the average chief executive and the average worker.\nTop bosses, it found, earn 133 times more than their staff. To achieve this, the average FTSE 100 chief executive is paid \u00a31,020 per hour, or \u00a33.9m a year \u2013 and needs only three working days to reach the average annual worker\u2019s pay of \u00a329,574.\nThe TUC was naturally enraged by the findings, but the free-market thinktank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, was among a small band to cry foul.\nMark Littlewood, the IEA\u2019s boss, argued that FTSE 100 bosses added hundreds of millions of pounds worth of value, making them cheap at the price. The example he gave, Terry Leahy, is flawed though. The former Tesco boss certainly expanded the supermarket hugely, but at the end of his tenure he took his eye off the ball in the crucial UK market and he also left the company nursing a \u00a31bn loss from a failed expansion into the US.\nThe Adam Smith Institute also weighed in to the argument, arguing that pay campaigners would be better off focusing on improving productivity \u2013 or the amount of output generated per worker \u2013 as a driving force for raising workers\u2019 wages and thus reducing the pay disparity between the factory floor and the boardroom.\nHowever, there are no signs that giving chief executives an increase in pay of 11% last year \u2013 compared with 3% for the average worker \u2013 has resulted in bosses improving the productivity of their businesses.\nIndeed, such glaring pay inequality could be viewed as demotivating for staff and thus damaging to worker output. A culture of teamwork brings more sustainable profits, not a maverick boss riding the waves of economic boom and bust.\nThe Christmas trading news from John Lewis and Next last week showed that a final dash for presents by shoppers helped deliver a festive season that was not as bad as feared for two of the high street\u2019s biggest names.\nThe relatively good news for those two high street stalwarts and the absence of a profit warning from Debenhams or other under-pressure chains like M&S have lifted hopes as more than 20 retailers prepare to report on festive trading in the coming week.\nBut hold the party poppers. Next\u2019s high-street stores had a dismal time and the group\u2019s profitability is being gradually squeezed by the shift to servicing online shoppers.\nJohn Lewis\u2019s profits are similarly under pressure as it battles to maintain its service culture and its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price promise amid huge discounting by ailing rivals and rising costs.\nInvestment in web operations has never been so crucial to the survival of clothing, homewares and beauty retailers, where the shift from the high street has stepped up. Nearly a quarter of all fashion is now bought online.\nBrexit uncertainty will keep a dampener on non-essential spending so traditional retailers face a high-wire walk between investing to survive and finding cost savings that will protect profits.\nBut even new online brands are not finding life easy.\nAccording to accounts filed on Friday, young fashion website Missguided crashed to a \u00a346m pretax loss in the year to last April \u2013 up from just \u00a31.6m a year before \u2013 as it admitted it had got products wrong. Trendy web-slipper seller Mahabis called in administrators last week. Even Asos, the banner carrier of the new retail economy, shocked the City with a profits warning before Christmas.\nSelling online is only part of the answer. These tough times will weed out sloppy retailers not offering value in terms of service, price or creative, differentiated products.",

        "content": "The country has given a warm welcome to thousands fleeing Assad\u2019s regime \u2013 but can they weather its bitter winters?\nWhen Ziad Ammar arrived in Canada, he had been out of jail for only three months. Tortured and starved in one of the prisons of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, he was weak and malnourished. It was not the best state in which to face a Canadian winter. \u201cI bought everything that I needed for a whole month and then never left the house,\u201d he said, laughing.\nAmmar, whose name has been changed to protect family members still in Syria, arrived in Montreal in the autumn of 2014. A native of Latakia, a coastal city on the glittering Mediterranean, he had never faced harsh winters, certainly nothing close to the blanket of snow that often adorns his new home city.\nHaving to get used to the Canadian cold, and quickly, he took to developing his culinary skills, cooking Syrian dishes after work. Now he regularly makes kibbeh labanieh, meatballs made with bulgur and cooked in a yoghurt stew, the quintessential comfort food, and a lentil soup that reminds him of the version he used to order at a specific restaurant every time he drove from Latakia to Aleppo. He also serves up traditional knafeh pastry, served warm with piping-hot sugar syrup, alongside a glass of salep, a creamy Ottoman drink made with orchid flour, milk and cinnamon.\n\u201cSitting around a table of food with family in the cold makes you feel warm,\u201d said Ammar, who has been reunited with his wife in Montreal. \u201cHere, you can have that same feeling of warmth because of the memories.\u201d\nOver the past three years, Canada has accepted more than 50,000 Syrian refugees as part of government- and privately-sponsored resettlement programmes. In an initiative that ran counter to the global mood of growing xenophobia and rightwing populism, its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, welcomed the first group of Syrians arriving as part of the government\u2019s campaign in late 2015. Many who came after enduring war and displacement, and the misery of refugee camps in the Middle East, set about rebuilding their lives in Canada.\nAdded to the usual challenges of integration \u2013 finding work, accommodation and acquiring the language \u2013 learning to love the Canadian winter has proved a formidable task.\nIn Montreal this weekend temperatures are expected to plunge to -20C with occasional snow flurries. The city launched a partial snow-clearing effort on Friday morning but freezing temperatures have made it extremely difficult for municipal workers to de-ice pavements. Horror stories \u2013 such as one from 1 January in which a couple driving on a highway in Quebec had their windshield shattered by flying ice \u2013 make it tempting to stay at home.\nYesterday the weather in Damascus, by contrast, was bright and sunny, with a high temperature of 14C.\nSyrians in Canada have countless stories about their first winter in the country \u2013 hibernating for weeks on end; the first few times they slipped on ice and broke a limb; miscalculating how long they would have to wait in -20C for the bus; shopping for proper winter coats and boots; or splashing hands with hot water after a walk in freezing weather.\nFor many new arrivals, the shock of the whole thing can drive them indoors.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a tiny bit of snow, they won\u2019t come,\u201d said Joulnar El Husseini-McCormick, an estate agent who volunteers to translate for newly arrived refugees at government departments, and who is originally from Homs herself.\n\u201cYou call them and they say, \u2018It\u2019s cold\u2019. I remember one of them asked to postpone the appointment until March. I told her that in March there is snow,\u201d she laughed.\n\u201cThey\u2019d ask us if they can keep the kids at home when it snows,\u201d she added. \u201cWe told them, \u2018You can\u2019t keep them at home for six months!\u2019\u201d\nIn Montreal the shopping districts, cafes and restaurants were bustling and alive ahead of the holidays. The city also boasts an extensive underground network of pedestrian tunnels to avoid the worst of the weather. But as the Christmas lights came down and local markets with mulled wine and were dismantled, winter really began to set in. Charming festive vistas are giving way to brutal icy streets and freezing rain.\nRather than conjuring up scenes of familial gatherings and comforting childhood memories, winter, for some new arrivals, symbolises a greater estrangement: a reminder of the warmth of communities they left behind, however torn apart by war they may have become. It can become a powerful sign of how different their new home is from the one they fled.\n\u201cI was alone when I arrived in Canada in January and had no idea how cold it was,\u201d said Dina Haddad, who is also from Latakia and arrived in Canada a year ago.\n\u201cWhen I would take the bus, I didn\u2019t know it arrived at specific times, so I\u2019d freeze and my hands would turn white from the cold until they were numb, and I would cry and say, \u2018I wish I never came to this cold\u2019. People would gather around me and ask me, \u2018Are you OK, ma\u2019am?\u2019 because of how much I was crying. Eventually, things worked out.\u201d\nFor those who remain inconsolable, there is always the promise of spring. \u201cI do regret it when I\u2019m waiting for a bus, it\u2019s -20C, windy, and the bus is late,\u201d said El Husseini-McCormick, who moved to Montreal in 2014 with her Canadian husband. \u201cThat\u2019s the peak of regret. I think to myself, what brought me here?\u201d\n\u201cBut when it\u2019s 10 degrees and people are smiling, and you realise it\u2019s spring, you\u2019ll see it,\u201d she added. \u201cSpring is the best feeling in the world.\u201d",

Even a murderer can be released early with good behaviour. I didn\u2019t kill anyone or hurt anyone, I didn\u2019t want my business to collapse \u2013 but I will not be free until the end of my life.\u201d\nRenata\u2019s harrowing experience mirrors a mounting personal debt crisis in the Czech Republic that is undermining one of Europe\u2019s most flourishing economies by driving workers into the shadow economy to evade aggressive debt collectors.\nNow Czech MPs are under pressure to enact emergency legislation that could provide an escape route for the country\u2019s vast army of debtors. They will vote on a radical new bankruptcy law this month after the Czech senate rejected an earlier proposal as too weak to tackle a crisis that critics say has left a trail of blighted lives and broken marriages.\nRenata, 54, is typical. Withholding her last name to shield her family and her five-year-old daughter, she described losing her home and possessions and enduring marital separation after the small building company she ran with her husband in a village near Prague went bust following the 2008 global financial crash, saddling her with bills she could not pay and allowing debt agencies to seize her property.\n\u201cIt has completely ruined my life,\u201d she said, sitting in a cafe in the industrial city of Kladno, 18 miles north-west of Prague. \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019d like to repay some of the debt, but I\u2019ve no money or property. And I need to care for my daughter.\u201d\nRenata owes around 7m Czech koruna (\u00a3245,000) according to 34 separate debt recovery notices tabled by different private bailiff companies, some of which have repeatedly harassed her parents for money. Compounding her problems is what experts say is one of Europe\u2019s most stringent insolvency laws, restricting bankruptcy to those able to prove they can pay 30% of their debts \u2013 impossible on her meagre income as a part-time bookkeeper. It is this law that MPs are being urged to reform.\nRenata is just one of 863,000 Czechs \u2013 out of a population of 10.6 million \u2013 facing paralysing demands after debt collectors ordered their bank accounts frozen and their incomes slashed on behalf of creditors determined to pursue outstanding dues regardless of ability to pay. Some 150,000 people have 10 or more outstanding debts for amounts they can never hope to pay. Many face inflated fines for not having valid tickets on public transport, often when they were children. Around 6,000 Czechs face debts from fines incurred when they were minors, mostly for being caught on trams or metro trains without tickets.\nCritics say lives are being scarred by a punitive debt-collecting system that has no parallel in western Europe \u2013 with local transport authorities and public utilities selling small unpaid debts to private collecting agencies at a huge mark-up. That often leads to modest sums being multiplied to thousands of pounds once late-payment sanctions and fees for lawyers and bailiffs are added. Some debtors borrow money to pay off the demands and fall into secondary debt.\n\u201cMy girlfriend and I were each fined 800 koruna (\u00a328) when we were caught on the tram without a ticket in 2006,\u201d said Sam Kahakzad, 32, a television producer from Prague. \u201cWe had no money, so couldn\u2019t pay on the spot. We didn\u2019t hear anything else until 2011, when we got letters demanding 28,000 koruna (\u00a3977) and warning we would be fined 10,000 koruna (\u00a3349) if we didn\u2019t pay within a month. I had to make two emergency payments from my salary.\u201d\nIn one instance, a debt officially quoted at 3.5p for the electricity company Bohemia Energy soared to more than \u00a3733 after costs.\nThe inflating of unpaid accounts with fees and penalties became commonplace after a 2001 reform ushering in a system of private bailiffs, who collected debts that had proliferated during a credit boom after the downfall of the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia in 1989.\nDebt recovery rates duly increased. But anti-debt campaigners point to abuses exacerbated by competition among the 150 private bailiffs \u2013 some of whom are notorious for entering homes and seizing property, including children\u2019s toys \u2013 and their close relationship with politicians, who have turned a blind eye to excesses.\nThey warn that rising indebtedness is feeding inequality and social exclusion that threatens the country\u2019s democratic gains after the fall of communism and joining the EU. \u201cExperience with indebtedness and collection is associated with lower trust in institutions, lower trust in democracy,\u201d said Daniel Prokop, a sociologist at Prague Charles University. \u201cThese people may not be authoritarian in the sense of supporting Vladimir Putin, but they say for people like them it doesn\u2019t matter whether there is democracy. It is the people around them who are driven to extreme parties.\u201d\nJan \u010cul\u00edk, Czech studies specialist at Glasgow University, called the issue \u201cone of the main factors destabilising the country\u201d. He said: \u201cNo wonder people distrust the democratic regime and vote for populists and the new oligarchs. Would you vote for \u2018democratic establishment\u2019 politicians who condemned you to perpetual debt slavery? Under communism, nothing like this ever happened.\u201d\nMeanwhile, debtors have become convenient scapegoats amid the rising populist mood. The Czech president, Milo\u0161 Zeman, who was prime minister when the current debt recovery law was passed, has repeatedly blamed them for their own predicament.\nRadek H\u00e1bl, a debt relief campaigner, compiled an interactive map showing that areas with the highest personal debt levels also displayed the greatest voter support for populist parties, and for Zeman, who was re-elected in last January\u2019s presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because Zeman says he hates debtors,\u201d said H\u00e1bl.",

        "content": "Knightley plays a woman reclaiming her voice in Wash Westmoreland\u2019s beautiful biopic of the French author\nKeira Knightley delivers a playfully sly, subtly nuanced performance in director and co-writer Wash Westmoreland\u2019s biographical drama about the titular French writer and performer. Focusing on Colette\u2019s early power struggles with her egotistical husband (Dominic West) and her challenging of traditional gender boundaries, it\u2019s an empowering and entertaining tale of a woman finding her own voice in a society in flux. Beautifully shot by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens, with production designs inspired by the French films of German director Max Oph\u00fcls, Colette convincingly conjures a late-19th/early-20th century milieu, to which it adds a thoroughly modern sensibility.\nIn late-1880s rural Burgundy, vagabond spirit and self-proclaimed \u201ccountry girl\u201d Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette is courted by literary entrepreneur Henri Gauthier-Villars, marriage to whom opens the door to an exciting new world in Paris. Initially dazzled by his cosmopolitan lifestyle, our heroine soon becomes aware that her husband\u2019s expenditure exceeds both his talent and his fidelity. Fortunes change, however, when her semi-autobiographical tales of a young girl\u2019s journey to maturity (penned at her husband\u2019s instruction, sometimes under lock and key) become a popular sensation.\nPublished under Gauthier-Villars\u2019 popular nom-de-plume \u201cWilly\u201d (he calls it \u201ca brand\u201d), the ghost-written Claudine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9cole strikes a chord, particularly with young female readers. A series of novels, stage productions, and trend-setting \u201cClaudine\u201d haircuts and accoutrements follow, making Willy and Colette (as she is now known) the toast of the town, while still maintaining the pretence of his authorship. But Colette\u2019s burgeoning relationships with socialite belle Georgie (a theatrically accented Eleanor Tomlinson) and later with the stereotype-defying Missy (Denise Gough, owning the role) encourage her to redefine herself, taking back control of \u2013 and credit for \u2013 her life and work.\nLeeds-born Westmoreland began working on Colette nearly 20 years ago with Richard Glatzer, the longtime partner with whom he made a string of movies including the wonderful coming-of-age gem Quincea\u00f1era and the moving drama Still Alice, for which Julianne Moore won a best actress Oscar. After Glatzer died in 2015, Westmoreland continued work on the script with Rebecca Lenkiewicz, the British playwright whose impressive screenwriting credits include Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s Ida and Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio\u2019s Disobedience. Between them, the trio have concocted a screenplay that gives each key character a distinctive register; from the hilariously pompous witticisms of Willy, a role West attacks with tangible relish, to the proud impertinence of Missy, a trailblazer who proves that women can wear the trousers, even when the law says otherwise.\nAt the centre of it all is Colette, whose charismatic personality we watch grow from wide-eyed wonder to defiant self-determination. \u201cOn my bad days, I feel like I can\u2019t find myself,\u201d explained Moore\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s-afflicted linguistics professor in Still Alice, and that line came back to me as I watched Knightley\u2019s writer trying to find her place in a world in which her own identity has been effectively stolen from her. \u201cNo one can take away who you are,\u201d Colette\u2019s mother (Fiona Shaw, excellent) reassures her distraught daughter, but Willy seems to be intent upon doing just that \u2013 subsuming her identity under his own overpowering ego.\nOn some levels, Colette bears thematic comparison to such recent releases as Bj\u00f6rn Runge\u2019s The Wife, in which Glenn Close\u2019s character buries her talent for the sake of her celebrated-writer husband\u2019s career, or Haifaa al-Mansour\u2019s Mary Shelley, in which Elle Fanning\u2019s author is overshadowed by her more celebrated poet partner. But here, the focus is on the creation of identity itself, and what it means to be the author of one\u2019s own destiny. Just as Glatzer and Westmoreland\u2019s 2013 film The Last of Robin Hood scratched away at the scabby subject of celebrity, so Colette cleverly unpacks the idea of life as performance, raising pertinent questions about the control of a public image, and its impact on private lives. Particularly intriguing are the scenes in which Colette\u2019s travails become the stuff of pantomime in the form of increasingly provocative theatrical productions, staged with a hint of carnivalesque chaos and evoking the spirit of Fellini.\nIn her best role since Saul Dibb\u2019s 2008 period drama The Duchess, Knightley brings Colette to life with a performance that blends grit with glamour in seemingly effortless fashion. Typically eye-catching costume design by Andrea Flesch (who did such striking work on Peter Strickland\u2019s The Duke of Burgundy) add to the film\u2019s appeal, as does the astute casting of supporting players Rebecca Root and Jake Graf, and the sharp use of locations in the UK and Hungary, which double handsomely for France.\n Colette is in cinemas from Wednesday 9 January",

Are there really deals to be had? Or should you hold off and fend off the post-festive gloom simply by breaking \u201cdry January\u201d?\nChristmas is a time to kick back and enjoy. After Christmas is a time to pay for the time before Christmas, whether settling a credit card bill or joining the gym you will never go to. So many people want a release and a holiday is something to look forward to and searches for holidays can start before the Queen\u2019s speech is even over.\nEmma Coulthurst from comparison site TravelSupermarket says today is likely to be the busiest as people dread going back to work on Monday. As a result, there is a rush for holidays at peak times.\n\u201cGetting in early and securing a 2019 break sooner rather than later, means you will find the best availability if you are restricted by school holidays or other commitments,\u201d she says.\n\u201cGenerally, the earlier you book, the better the choice and price. Flight prices tend to increase for peak dates whereas accommodation tends to stay fairly static. Leave it and prices are likely to rise overall. The peak summer getaway and the May bank holiday are the ones to particularly get organised for. You will also have time to save up.\u201d\nSome holidaymakers see the Algarve as a cheaper destination than adjoining Spain, while the success of shows such as Game of Thrones have put Croatia into the sights of many, according to TravelSupermarket.\nBali in Indonesia has increased in popularity as a long-haul destination due to the cost of living. Tui, meanwhile, singles out Mexico as its most popular long-haul destination.\nFor those battling against the fall in value of the pound, South Africa is a possibility, says Rory Boland, travel editor of Which?. \u201cWhile it has fallen significantly against all major currencies since Brexit and again in the last year, the rand has been struggling as well. Head to the lesser-explored Eastern Cape and Sunshine Coast for acres of beaches and five-star accommodation and food for half the price you\u2019d pay in the States or Oz.\u201d\nAlthough visitor numbers to Turkey nosedived in 2016 following a series of terrorist attacks and a failed coup, bookings bounced back last year.\nAfter years of British holidaymakers turning away from Egypt, bookings are also up following heavy marketing and a drop in hotel prices.\nMuch like \u201cBlack Friday\u201d and \u201cCyber Monday\u201d, be wary of any \u201cdeals\u201d because, as Boland says, there is little incentive for travel agents to lower their prices. A study by Which? of 30 \u201ctime-limited deals\u201d in 2017 found 16 were the same price, or cheaper, later in the year. \u201cYou\u2019re better off shopping around over time to get the right price. Set up alerts on Skyscanner and Momondo for any drop in the price of flights, and use comparison websites.\u201d\nPackage holidays are not always the cheapest way to book and holidaymakers should do their research before committing to a deal, he advises.\n\u201cLast year, Which? Travel found that, depending on the destination, DIY holidays \u2013 where you eat and drink in local restaurants and bars \u2013 could save you more than \u00a3300 per person,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we also found instances where the opposite was true. In one example, a four-star all-inclusive deal beat the DIY price by more than \u00a3500. Sadly, there\u2019s no easy answer, as it all depends on where you\u2019re travelling to.\u201d\nIs your holiday even safe with the uncertainty? The Association of British Travel Agents believes it is. It says flights will continue between the UK and the EU and consumers should feel confident, particularly with package holidays, as those booking with a UK travel company have protection under the Package Travel Regulations, with a right to a full refund if a holiday can no longer be provided.\nWhere problems do remain is with currency, as the pound has plummeted against the euro since the 2016 vote. Thomas Cook suggests holidaymakers will try to lock into all-inclusive deals to avoid further fluctuations.\nBut, as Boland explains, buying now does not necessarily mean avoiding future increases. He says: \u201cBrexit has the potential to cause disruption to holiday plans. Provided it\u2019s in their terms and conditions, package holiday providers have the right to raise the price of a holiday you have booked and paid for by up to 8% if they incur additional costs due to new taxes or fees imposed by third parties, such as governments or airports, or the exchange rate relevant to the package increases. That means you might have already bought a \u00a31,000 holiday, but the agent can still come back and ask for another \u00a380.\u201d\n May is the cheapest month of the summer for short-haul package holidays.\n The last week of August offers the best deals for those who are tied into organising their trip during school holidays.\n Flying midweek, instead of weekends, offers cheaper opportunities, as does off-peak during the day.\n If you decide to organise your own holiday, book flights and hotel or car hire together to get the same Atol protection given to all-inclusive package deals.\n Destinations with new flight routes launching throw up the possibility of grabbing cheap introductory fares.\n Most three-star or better hotels will either beat the price you have found online or at least match it if you approach them direct.Sources: Which?, TravelSupermarket",

        "content": "The interactive fiction of the latest Black Mirror episode is a thrilling indication of the direction games could take\nA new episode of Charlie Brooker\u2019s Black Mirror debuted on Netflix just before the new year. Unlike most previous examples, Bandersnatch is not a cautionary tale of how current technologies might evolve to further ruin our hearts, minds and communities. It is, rather, a period piece set in early-1980s Britain, when young video-game programmers were becoming millionaires selling their games in WH Smith. Unlike all previous Black Mirror episodes, Bandersnatch is a nonlinear film that allows the viewer to steer the plot using simple A/B choices at key moments in the drama. Like the Choose Your Own Adventure books of the period, these choices range from the mundane (\u201cwhich cereal would you like for breakfast?\u201d) to the life-imperilling, and each path winds to one of a number of possible endings.\nThat Netflix should choose to invest in the required technology, then use it with one of its prestige shows is, regardless of how you judge the results, thrilling, and demonstrates that games still have the capacity to enter new rooms of culture to woo those who might otherwise reject the form. Bandersnatch may even prove a tipping point for interactive fiction. This year also promises Telling Lies, a pseudo-sequel to Her Story, one of the best games of the genre to date, which also uses filmed footage (clips of police interview tapes) to reshuffle the narrative in beguiling ways.\nThe opportunity to shape stories is one of the base appeals of video games, and 2019 promises a range of opportunities for the wannabe authors. Judgment is an atypical example from Japan, a narrative-led investigative game in which you play as a lawyer handling cases that range from murder to adultery and beyond. The Last of Us Part 2 is more familiar fare, a sequel to the developer Naughty Dog\u2019s luxuriously violent, occasionally po-faced cinematic study of post-apocalypse America.\nFor something a little more saccharine, January marks the long-awaited arrival of Kingdom Hearts 3, a byzantine collaboration from Disney and Final Fantasy creator Square Enix (and surely an intellectual property lawyer\u2019s nightmare), whose mythology has become so complex that the games have become a punchline to many a meme. Years of delays suggest a chaotic gestation, but there\u2019s a slim chance Disney has wrangled director Tetsuya Nomura\u2019s creativity into something that honours the glittering characters, ranging from Mickey Mouse to Frozen\u2019s Olaf; creativity that he has, in games past, failed to place into a fitting context.\nNomura\u2019s countryman Hidetaka Miyazaki has more favourable form; his Dark Souls games may require just as much work from a player to work out what precisely is going on, but his talent for world-building and atmosphere is unparalleled. Miyazaki\u2019s new game, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, is set in a reimagined late-16th century Sengoku-period Japan, where you play as a shinobi (mercenary) whose prosthetic arm seems to have done nothing to spoil his ability to fight.\nFor those players who prefer to write their own stories, Dreams, from the British studio and LittleBigPlanet series creator Media Molecule, is a suite of creative tools that can be used to turn ideas into playable vignettes. Worlds are summoned and shaped, soundtracks composed and creatures raised via a toolbox that is more paint palette than accounting software, and the game may become something of a story factory for the young and ingenious.\nA new version of Animal Crossing for Nintendo\u2019s share-price boosting Switch console will allow millennials to experience a storyline closed to all but the most privileged as they move to the countryside and take on odd jobs in order to pay the mortgage on a newly acquired detached property, while opting to befriend or besmirch their neighbours. Finally, for those who can\u2019t be bothered with small talk, Untitled Goose Game (also for Switch) allows us to enact honking terror on a village as a mischievous loosed goose. What better story to salve the incoming blows of the looming year and its inevitable political sucker punches?",

This will be visible from western parts of Europe and Africa and South and North America. The eclipse coincides with a supermoon, of which there are three in 2019. This supermoon will be a \u201cblood\u201d moon \u2013 because of the reddish hue the moon takes during the eclipse \u2013 caused by the effect of Earth\u2019s atmosphere on different wavelengths of light.\n21 January, 19 February and 21 March\nA supermoon is a full or new moon which coincides with the closest distance the moon comes to the Earth in its orbit. This results in an enlarged appearance and the moon can look 15-30% brighter. They also cause larger than usual tides a day or two later.\n13 February\nMars and Uranus will appear extremely close to each other in the night sky \u2013 this is known as an appulse. This event is also a conjunction, which in astronomy means that the planets share the same right ascension.\n11 November\nFor five hours and 29 minutes Mercury will be visible crossing the sun. It will be one of 14 such transits in the 21st century \u2013 the last one occurred in 2016.\n12-16 December\nThese meteors originate from 3200 Phaethon \u2013 an asteroid that was discovered in 1983 and orbits the sun every 3.3 years. This spectacular shower usually produces about 100 meteors per hour \u2013 although this year it occurs near a full moon, which will reduce its radiance \u2013 and it will be best observed before dawn.",

        "content": "A tax on daytrippers has hit the headlines, but La Serenissima\u2019s mounting problems also include rising waters, angry locals and a potential black mark from Unesco\nVenice\u2019s Santa Lucia railway station is packed as visitors scuttle across the concourse towards the water-bus stops. Taking a selfie against the backdrop of the Grand Canal, Ciro Esposito and his girlfriend have just arrived and are unimpressed with what may greet them in future if the Venetian authorities get their way: a minimum city entry fee of \u20ac2.50 throughout the year, rising to between \u20ac5 and \u20ac10 during peak periods.\nIt is the price of a cappuccino, but for them \u201cit\u2019s going too far\u201d. \u201cThey are using people like a bank machine,\u201d says Esposito. \u201cWe are in Europe and can travel freely across borders, yet we have to pay to enter one of our own cities.\u201d\nIn earlier times it was the wheeled suitcases that tourists rattled over the cobbles that drew the ire of Venetians \u2013 so much so that the authorities pledged to fine anyone caught using one up to \u20ac500. That never happened, but now another \u2013 more plausible \u2013 penalty is being concocted. To manage the impact of the 30 million people who visit the lagoon city every year, the daytrippers \u2013 those who come, take pictures, and leave \u2013 are to be forced to pay, although it is unclear when the tax will be introduced or how it could be enforced.\nVenice may have a centuries-long history of cultivating tourism, devising crowd-drawing events such as the annual carnival, the Biennale international art exhibition and a star-studded film festival, but the advent of mass tourism has left it struggling with how to deal with the near-constant hordes who trudge around its precious sites, through its 11th century basilica, over its famous Rialto bridge, and along its maze of winding calle. The influx is a blessing for the local council\u2019s coffers but a scourge on the city\u2019s fragile monuments and environment.\nLuigi Brugnaro, the Venice mayor who regularly lashes out at uncouth tourists, is increasingly under pressure to act. Not only does he face local elections next year but, in July, Unesco will decide whether or not to put the fragile city \u2013 battered by increasingly frequent flooding and swamped in summer by tourists \u2013 alongside America\u2019s Everglades National Park and the rainforests of Madagascar on its list of the world\u2019s endangered heritage sites.\nFor many Italians, though, the charge is not the answer. Even those who welcome it are sceptical that it will make a real difference. The entrance fee will not apply to those who have booked hotel rooms, and visitors already pay a tourist tax of up to \u20ac6 per night if they stay in the city.\n\u201cIf people want to come, then they will still pay to come,\u201d says Clelia Tanzarelli, a regular visitor from Rome. \u201cVenice is a very delicate city and there needs to be some plan, but if this is just an extra tax then it won\u2019t solve the problem. A better solution would be to limit visitor numbers.\u201d\nAs with the wheeled suitcases, the dilemma is how on earth to turn the plan into a workable and enforceable policy. There have been suggestions that the charge could be added to the cost of arriving in the city either by train, bus or cruise ship, with the respective transport companies passing the proceeds on to Venice authorities.\nWhile it is not possible to drive in Venice, people can arrive in the mainland area of the lagoon and park their vehicle for between \u20ac12 and \u20ac29 a day. Charging cruise-ship passengers is fairly straightforward \u2013 they could pay on the boat or as they disembark \u2013 but applying it to other modes of transport and distinguishing between Venice residents and visitors will be more challenging.\n\u201cBeyond the announcement, it doesn\u2019t seem to have been well thought out,\u201d said Dominic Standish, a British academic and author of the book Venice in Environmental Peril? Myth and Reality.\n\u201cBut the paradox of this measure is that the authorities bemoan tourism and say Venice is becoming like Disneyland, but if they\u2019re able to implement it, then it will make the city even more like Disneyland.\u201d\nThe notion of the fee appealing to residents may also backfire. Venetians have held several protests in recent years against a tourism industry which they argue has eroded their quality of life, damaged the environment and driven residents away. On some days the current population of 55,000 (down from about 175,000 in the post-second-world-war years) is dwarfed by the number of tourists.\nBrugnaro has said that some of the extra cash from the fee will help fund the cleaning up of rubbish that daytrippers leave in their wake and improve the lives of locals, but many of those same locals are enraged by the idea that the charge would also have to be paid by departed Venetians visiting home and family. Understandably, that is not something they can celebrate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like adding insult to injury,\u201d said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the Gruppo 25 Aprile activist group. \u201cAfter forcing thousands of people to leave the city, you now force them to pay to visit their families? The tax would make sense if it was a way to offset the environmental impact of the cruise ships, as other than for cruise passengers, it\u2019s very difficult to apply.\u201d\nIn a move to allay environmental concerns, Brugnaro tried to indicate to Unesco in late 2017 that he was getting tough on the cruise ships that, weighing more than 96,000 tonnes, disembark thousands of passengers in the heart of the city. They would no longer be able to sail past St Mark\u2019s Square, he announced, and would instead take a less glamorous route via the industrial area of Marghera.\nEnvironmentalists have claimed that waves caused by the cruise ships have eroded the underwater supports of historic buildings and polluted the waters. But the plan is yet to be approved by the national government. If and when that approval comes, work on the new route, which requires the dredging of canals and construction of a new port, would take an estimated four years. And while diverting the ships would better preserve the historic centre, the move will do little to address concerns about pollution.\nIt goes without saying, however, that Venice\u2019s troubles are not limited to tourism. The city is also endangered by recurring acque alte, or high waters. On 29 October last year, three-quarters of the city was hit by the worst flooding in a decade. Rain poured for almost 24 hours, with strong winds raising the water to 156cm above the normal sea level \u2013 a record reached only five times in the history of the city. As tourists persevered with their holidays \u2013 wading through knee-deep water in wellies and venturing to deluged shops and restaurants \u2013 locals counted the cost of the damage.\nAnd the reckoning continues. A local newspaper has referred to the autumn flood as a day that Venetians will never forget.\nFor the second time since 2000, water filled St Mark\u2019s Basilica, causing damage to the marble floors, bronze metal doors and mosaic floors of the 1,000-year-old church. A few days after, the cathedral\u2019s administrators made the striking claim that the damage had caused the structure to age \u201c20 years in one day\u201d. Initial repairs are costing about \u20ac2.2m but Marco Piana, one of the administrators, said the major concern was the long-term impact of the damage.\nAdministrators said the damage would have been avoided if the multibillion-pound Mose project designed to prevent flooding in the Venice lagoon had been up and running. Work on the flood barrier began in 2003 but has been dogged by delays and myriad issues, including a corruption scandal that emerged in 2014 and saw former mayor Giorgio Orsoni accused of accepting bribes in return for awarding contracts.\nThe latest estimated completion date is 2022, and the administrators have urged the national government to finish it as soon as possible.\n\u201cAround 96% is done, so there is just a small bit left to do, but they keep pushing the date back \u2026 all of this depends on the funding coming from the government,\u201d said Piana.\nThe floor of the nearby Caff\u00e8 Florian, one of Italy\u2019s oldest and most famous coffee houses, was also damaged by the floods, as were several shops.\nMost locals grin and bear the high water when it occurs. \u201cIt does bother us when it happens but we\u2019re used to it, and the tourists have fun with it,\u201d said Michele Levorato, who runs a stall next to the Rialto bridge. He added that most locals also learned to live alongside the tourists, although he would like to see a \u201cbetter quality\u201d of visitor. \u201cMany don\u2019t respect the city,\u201d he said.\nIn advance of the Unesco deadline, authorities have tried other initiatives to better manage tourism, such as installing turnstiles at the two entry points to the lagoon during peak periods in an attempt to control the crowds heading towards St Mark\u2019s Square and the Rialto. They are also trying to encourage people to visit other, lesser-known areas of the Venetian lagoon or one of its other islands, such as Murano and Burano.\nBut the uniqueness of Venice will forever hold an allure, making it unlikely that the measures will have much impact.\n\u201cIf they want to improve the city they need to invest in better infrastructure in order to move people around better,\u201d said Standish. \u201cAn underground train system is something that has been debated for decades but the current administration is unwilling to consider it. This is partly the issue \u2013 they don\u2019t seem willing to make things better. They just have this anti-tourism bias.\u201d",

        "content": "For the Canadian/Korean actor, hosting tonight\u2019s Golden Globes is part of a lifelong mission towards full representation of Asians on our screens\nIn 1993, Sandra Oh, who plays the eponymous MI6 agent in the hit TV show Killing Eve, went to the cinema to see The Joy Luck Club. Wayne Wang\u2019s film about four Chinese immigrant mothers and their American-born daughters had a big impact on the young Canadian-Korean actor. An adaptation of Amy Tan\u2019s 1989 novel, it left her \u201cshuddering, weeping \u2026 weeping more than really the film deserved\u201d, Oh has recalled, so emotional was she about finally watching the experience of Asian immigrants on the screen.\nLater today, Oh\u2019s place in the entertainment industry is to be recognised twice over, as she co-hosts the Golden Globe awards at a Beverly Hills ceremony in which she is also the first Asian nominee for \u201cbest actress in a drama series\u201d.\nAccording to Owen McDonnell, the Irish actor who plays Oh\u2019s husband in Killing Eve, she is the perfect choice as compere. \u201cSandra is a great champion of actors,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cShe believes we need to be consulted, just like the art department. We need to have a voice and, if we have done our work, that we can really help.\u201d\nAt 47, Oh already has one Globe, for her longstanding role in the medical show Grey\u2019s Anatomy, but the chance to present the 76th awards alongside comedian Andy Samberg with an estimated audience of 19 million is a significant coup. And if she fails to put a cherry on the cake by winning the acting award \u2013 over Elisabeth Moss from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Crown\u2019s Claire Foy and Westworld\u2019s Evan Rachel Wood, Samberg has a plan. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you a crappy little tinfoil fake Globe, just in case you don\u2019t win, and I\u2019m going to bring it out and give it to you and be like, \u2018You\u2019re always a winner to me\u2019,\u201d he has said.\nBroadcaster NBC was looking for an eyecatching duo to launch its new deal to cover the ceremony, so the choice of Oh reflects the continued \u201csurprise factor\u201d that comes with being an Asian star. Oh describes her selection as \u201ccrazy-pants in a great way\u201d, and admits she is terrified. She agreed to do it, she told Hollywood Reporter, to point to real change: \u201cI want to focus on that, \u2019cause people can pooh-pooh Hollywood all they want \u2013 and there is a lot to pooh-pooh, sure \u2013 but we also make culture. How many gazillions of people have seen Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians? That changes things.\u201d\nOh suspects that, like many others in her Asian-descended community, she has been in denial about a personal burden of \u201cso much grief\u201d that comes from not being portrayed on screen. And in the 25 years since The Joy Luck Club, the shift towards diverse casting has been slow. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough \u2013 not anywhere near \u2013 Asian-American faces up there to represent our population,\u201d Oh says.\nThe actor had low expectations when BBC America sent her the screenplay for Killing Eve and didn\u2019t guess she was up for a lead role \u201c[I remember] quickly scrolling through my phone, trying to find my part, and I\u2019m talking to my agent like, \u2018I don\u2019t get it. What\u2019s the part?\u2019.\u201d\nBorn in Nepean, a small town outside Ottawa, Oh is the middle child of strict, high-achieving parents who had come to North America after the Korean war. Her father is an economist and her mother a biochemist, while her older sister is now an attorney and her brother a medical geneticist. She remembers a \u201ctypical Korean upbringing\u201d with \u201clots of church, lots of golf\u201d.\nEntering Canadian showbusiness on a low rung, Oh was aided, she now recognises, by a \u201cmandate for diversity\u201d. \u201cI ticked all their boxes,\u201d she has said. \u201cYou could always feel that you were the quota \u2026 But I benefited a lot and took it with the correct outlook, which is just that I\u2019m going to gain as much experience as I can and I will transform it in the way I want to transform it.\u201d\nA lead part in the 1994 film Double Happiness helped establish her in Canada, but it was playing Cristina Yang in ABC\u2019s Grey\u2019s Anatomy for 10 seasons that set her up with a vociferous fan base. When she left Seattle Grace Mercy West hospital for ever in 2014 many viewers groaned with pain.\nHer role in Alexander Payne\u2019s 2004 film Sideways had been crucial to its success. As biker Stephanie, she has one notably violent outburst, and was encouraged by Payne, her then husband, to call on all her suppressed Korean anger.\nLast year as Eve, an everyday MI6 operative and assassin hunter, Oh became an international celebrity. She initially signed up, she has said, because she liked the idea of playing a woman \u201cwho is undone\u201d yet \u201cthe undoing gives her life\u201d. Devotees now eagerly await a second series in the spring, this time scripted by actor-writer Emerald Fennell.\nThe show is based on the novellas of Luke Jennings, the Observer\u2019s recently departed dance critic, and he is delighted with Oh\u2019s performance. \u201cEve is a difficult role. She has to be completely and relatably ordinary, she has to be funny, and she has to be alluring, all at the same time. Sandra carries this off stylishly and apparently effortlessly because, as an actor, she\u2019s without ego,\u201d he said this weekend. \u201cShe\u2019ll be almost invisible, and then she\u2019ll throw a switch and illuminate.\u201d\nOn set, co-star Fiona Shaw has characterised Oh as \u201cfantastically focused on the craft of the thing\u201d, while McDonnell praises her determination to make each scene work. \u201cShe is very collaborative and didn\u2019t come to it with an agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cWe thought it out together. There was no blocking of my ideas. We created a couple who are very tight but starting to fail each other slightly because of the different things they are doing.\u201d\nWhatever happens tonight, Oh will need fresh ways to cope with the Hollywood hoopla \u2013 something she has always quietly avoided. Although she is believed to be dating Russian-born artist Lev Rukhin, she took her parents to the Emmy awards last summer. She is also unlikely to read this: she steers clear of her own press in an effort to stay real. \u201cWhile rationally you might know it\u2019s ridiculous, it can hurt your feelings. It can knock me off from being my authentic self,\u201d she has said.\n1971 Born in Nepean, Ontario, Oh learns to dance before moving into acting\n1994 Stars in Canadian film Double Happiness\n2004 A role in Sideways showcases her skill\n2005 Begins 10 seasons of TV\u2019s Grey\u2019s Anatomy, playing surgeon Cristina Yang\n2018\nSharing top billing with Jodie Comer in Killing Eve, Oh becomes the UK\u2019s favourite secret agent\n2019\nCo-host of the Golden Globes with Andy Samberg",

Membership of the Friends of the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the waterways\u2019 version of the National Trust, hit 28,000 this year. Towpaths are teeming with walkers, anglers and cyclists, and there are thousands of volunteers working on 98 canal restoration projects from Devon to West Sussex to Cumbria. The Inland Waterways Association (IWA), the charity that champions canal restoration, is working towards reopening 2,500 miles of \u201cdead\u201d canals which lie derelict.\nWright\u2019s 11-year-old daughter, Emma, who is home-educated, is an ardent advocate of barge life. Her YouTube channel, Narrowboat Girl, which documents their slow journey along the canals, stopping for a while here and there, has attracted more than 100,000 views. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool,\u201d said Emma. \u201cI\u2019m learning all the time on the water and the towpath, about birds, animals and plants.\u201d\nDue to be published early this year, a report by the restoration hub of the IWA will emphasise the benefits of canal restoration in terms of economic regeneration, wildlife and plant diversity, architectural heritage, tourism and education. Putting freight back on the canals is also viable, which is why an inland port is being planned in Leeds.\nMike Palmer, the report\u2019s main author, said the canal network was \u201ca huge linear national park \u2013 a leisure park, a vital wildlife sanctuary, an important industrial heritage site and an environment-friendly transport system all rolled into one\u201d.\nWhile the report is being digested, the IWA volunteers will be hard at work on projects, which include:\n De-silting work on an abandoned stretch of the Wey and Arun navigation near the Surrey-West Sussex border.\n The completion of a two-year restoration of a hopelessly derelict lock on the Grantham canal in the east Midlands, bringing the Lincolnshire town a step closer to returning to the national network it left more than 80 years ago.\n A redoubling of fundraising efforts by the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, which raised the money to build an aqueduct over the M6 toll road 16 years ago despite the fact that there is no canal there (there will be, eventually). Unless work on a tunnel under a railway and a new roundabout starts within a year or so costs will increase enormously. The trust must raise \u00a31m by the end of this year in a campaign led by the actor and canals supporter David Suchet: it has just passed \u00a3530,000.\n Taking the next step on one of the most daunting challenges faced by any of the nation\u2019s restoration projects, the Missing Mile on the Cotswold canals, a stretch that was more or less obliterated when the M5 was built. Motorists on the A419 will see narrowboats crossing the middle of a roundabout; there is also junction 13 of the M5 to deal with, plus a major gas pipeline and two more roundabouts. It should be finished by 2023, bringing Stroud back on to the national network.\nThe IWA\u2019s report aims to change the attitude of funders, politicians, government departments, local authorities, restoration groups and even health professionals. As well as the economic and environmental benefits of canals, it will stress the effects on health, a point made by Philippa Moreton, a retired doctor who advised many of her patients to take towpath walks in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, where she worked.\nMoreton said: \u201cRegular exercise in a beautiful, peaceful natural environment with water has an added bonus. It gives a sense of wellbeing, reduces stress and helps depression. Walking beside a canal not only helps patients with diabetes, hypertension, lung disease and arthritis but also patients with mental health problems.\u201d\nThe report will recommend focusing on micro-projects rather than the entire length of a canal. Restoration should be seen by government agencies and volunteers as a national issue, rather than as a hotch-potch of local groups working in isolation.\n\u201cThere was a big gap in terms of looking at things strategically,\u201d said Palmer, who chairs the waterways recovery group, the IWA\u2019s volunteer taskforce.\nThere are long-running disputes with road builders and planners in Swindon; on the route of the abandoned Berkshire and Wiltshire canal; on the new Bedford and Milton Keynes waterway; and on the Lichfield and Hatherton canal.\n\u201cEverybody is struggling with planning permission, with highway crossings, with water abstraction rights,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cThis report will say to the government, to the Environment Agency, \u2018you need to do better on this\u2019. It\u2019s quite likely that even the bosses of any ministry don\u2019t actually understand that it\u2019s a major issue. They just think it\u2019s dozens of little local issues and don\u2019t spot that they\u2019re joined up.\u201d\nDespite this lack of political will, Britain\u2019s canals have had their advocates. In the 1960s, the Queen Mother and the transport minister, Barbara Castle, were among those who spoke up for canals at a time when the attitude of many, especially in local politics, was that they were dirty, dangerous and of no value.\nJohn Dodwell, who has been active in restoring the waterways since 1961 and who chairs the Montgomery Canal Partnership, said that a 1970 conference in Oxford on the urban future of canals \u201cwas instrumental in turning the tide with town planners and highway engineers\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cWe need something similar now, especially with road builders.\u201d Dodwell welcomed the IWA report and pointed out that there were no national planning guidelines covering the restoration of canals.\nOne of the best examples of a self-contained, landlocked restoration that has improved life is in Stroud. The Cotswold canals restoration, a big project that will eventually reconnect the Severn and the Thames, has been heavily supported for 10 years by Stroud district council.\nSeveral miles have been reopened, and the council has moved its offices to Ebley Mill, which was a moribund part of town a few years ago. David Marshall, the council\u2019s canal project manager, said: \u201cThe canal used to be a place to avoid \u2013 rubbish, derelict, broken locks \u2013 and now it\u2019s a place to come to. What we\u2019ve done so far stands on its own two feet.\u201d\nThe Cotswold project has more than 7,000 members, more than any other canal trust. Palmer, whose main aim is to generate more externally-funded projects on the waterways, said: \u201cWe want more people to be involved in the waterways.\n\u201cThe purpose of our report is to show that you don\u2019t need to fully restore a canal in order to gain all the benefits. If you start with a small piece of restoration and plan it well you will get the benefits right from day one. It might be restoring a kilometre here, restoring a canalside warehouse that becomes a community centre. A lot of people just want somewhere safe to walk, or a cycle path. And when people see one kilometre restored they want the next, and the next\u2026\u201d\nOne day it will be possible, as it was 150 years ago, to travel by inland waterways from Littlehampton in West Sussex to the Lake District. By road, on a good day, that would take six hours. At the more sedate pace of the canals, where the speed limit is 4mph, it would take weeks.\nBut what\u2019s the rush? The yearning for a slower life, revealed to millions of television viewers by Timothy West and Prunella Scales in the nine series of Channel 4\u2019s Great Canal Journeys, is one of the big attractions of the inland waterways.\nThe most popular writer on canals was Tom Rolt, the godfather of canal restoration who helped found the IWA. In his hugely popular and still in-print 1944 book, Narrow Boat, he said that canal travel \u201cseemed to me to fulfil in the fullest sense the meaning of travel as opposed to a mere blind hurrying from place to place\u201d.\nHe wrote: \u201cTo step down from some busy thoroughfare on to the quiet towpath of a canal, even in the heart of a town, is to step backward a hundred years or more and to see things in a different, and perhaps more balanced, perspective.\u201d\nFiona and Emma Wright could not agree more.",

But instead of complaining, she, like any good entrepreneur, took action: she opened up a business.\nThe business is called Bella\u2019s Sweet Scrubs and it\u2019s owned by 11-year old capitalist and marketing whiz Bella Berrellez.\nBella\u2019s company sells sugar scrubs, which is something I\u2019ve never heard of. But please don\u2019t take my ignorance as criticism. I\u2019ve learned that a \u201cscrub\u201d is kind of a paste that you use in the shower and it\u2019s a very popular thing.\nThe products sold by Bella\u2019s Sweet Scrubs are made of organic sugar, organic coconut oil, organic olive oil, organic dye and organic essential oils. They\u2019re handmade by Bella herself and she sells them on her Etsy site for only seven bucks a jar.\nBella claims in a report by local television station WJLA that by scrubbing your body with her product just two or three times a week, your skin will be \u201cnice and soft\u201d and smell like lavender, eucalyptus or even purple rain, whatever that is. If you live in Montgomery county, Maryland, she\u2019ll even personally deliver your purchase for an additional 50 cents (a price that I \u2013 with all due respect - would recommend revisiting). Another nice touch is that she includes a handwritten letter with each order. Not bad.\nAlso not bad is Bella\u2019s marketing acumen. Ask anyone who\u2019s succeeded in business and they\u2019ll tell you that timing is important \u2013 and Bella\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be better. She not only launched the business to solve a potential financial problem but she chose to sell something cool and trendy: a natural, organic, homemade, healthy product.\nBut more importantly, she used her age and her story \u2013 which ties directly into a leading national news story \u2013 to get lots of media coverage, including a four-minute segment this week on a local television morning show. Oh, and I\u2019m writing about her too. There\u2019s nothing like free PR to help promote a new startup and I personally know a few entrepreneurs \u2013 decades older than Bella \u2013 who would kill for the same kind of exposure.\nBut with all her media success, Bella\u2019s still humble about the operation. \u201cI was just thinking of creative and fun ways to contribute to the family,\u201d she told local TV station Fox 5.\nSo here\u2019s your chance to help out a furloughed worker and support a young entrepreneur. Oh, and smell a little bit better too. Who can argue with that business proposition?",

        "content": "Elizabeth Jennings certainly has ballast in the ranks of 20th-century poets and maintains a strongish claim on our attention in the 21st. She first made her name as the only woman among the \u201cmovement\u201d poets \u2013 Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis, John Wain, Donald Davie. They were fashionable in the 1950s, reflecting the spirit of the times with their reverence for the real not the romantic, and their restrained, comprehensible language.\nJennings would later insist that she was never part of their gang, and outlasted many of them as a poet in her own right, her collections appearing to acclaim, substantial sales and a procession of prizes right up until her death in 2001. She has left her mark on the canon, with a few enduringly popular, much anthologised works (some on the A-level syllabus) such as One Flesh, where a daughter looks at her elderly parents in their twin beds and wonders about the passion that once begat her.\nDo they know they\u2019re old, These two who are my father and my mother Whose fire from which I came, has now grown cold?\nShe has resonance because she wrote from life. She was never political, though often religious. That provides some of the grit in this first biography of her by the American academic Dana Greene.\nJennings suffered all her adult life from mental health problems \u2013 which Greene ascribes rather too straightforwardly to fear of her father as a child. She tried to kill herself on more than one occasion and spent long periods as a patient in mental hospitals. Her highs and lows followed one after another in a pattern that repeated itself over the decades. It requires a deft biographer to give the narration of such a life any sort of momentum.\nThe challenge is made all the greater because, though her poetry reached a wide audience, Jennings\u2019s life took place within very narrow parameters. Based in Oxford from the age of six, she rarely left its familiar environs. A loner who had, at most, a handful of intimate friendships, she filled her days observing others from her table in cafes and her nights in a series of bedsits churning out thousands of poems, most unpublished.\nFor one who wrote from life, she was also oddly secret in her verse. Her mental health episodes are often treated obliquely, and it is hard to work out whether the torment she suffered was part of her muse, or what descended when words deserted her.\nShe never married, and was estranged from her otherwise unexceptional parents and sister. Her two really close adult relationships appear to have been with Catholic priests, who also had strong reasons for keeping quiet about what were undeniably love affairs, but the men\u2019s names and the details remain frustratingly opaque in Greene\u2019s telling.\nWhat does seem clear is that Jennings\u2019s cradle Catholicism caused great damage to her emotional life, giving her a horror of sex. It seems likely, also,, in some way, to have contributed to her mental instability. Yet, at the same time, faith was central to her muse. Many of her best poems drew on it for their imagery, their insights into human nature, and their transcendent dimension.\nThat is, surely, the central tension in a life that for all its restrictions was vivid. When her poetry had become sufficiently celebrated to enable her to give up her job in an Oxford library, she became a familiar figure to people in the town, \u201cthe bag lady of the sonnets\u201d, wandering round with her collection of plastic carriers, eccentrically dressed, shut in her own world even as she observed theirs.\nIn 1992, she was invited to Buckingham Palace to receive a CBE from the Queen who, in the grainy photograph included in the book, seems to be smiling a more companionable smile than usual. For her part, Jennings, in her funny beret and duffle coat, is in tears. Quite why is just another of the unresolved mysteries that haunts this biography.\nGreene is to be applauded for contributing to the posthumous reputation of Jennings\u2019s poetry and for bringing into stark focus the fascinating questions about the woman who produced it. That answers remain so elusive is perhaps part of Elizabeth Jennings\u2019s abiding appeal.\n Elizabeth Jennings: The Inward War by Dana Greene is published by OUP (\u00a325).

        "content": "My partner\u2019s mother, Miranda Beavis, who has died aged 83, was a probation officer and sculptor.\nDuring her first marriage, to the Guardian editor Alastair Hetherington, she was an important source of advice and support to him \u2013 an intelligent, liberal-minded sounding board. \u201cThere were few others to whom I could talk candidly,\u201d he recalled. \u201cMiranda was vital in maintaining a sensible perspective.\u201d\nShe was born in Manchester, the daughter of two academics at the university \u2013 Richard Oliver, professor of education, and Anna White, a lecturer in English. She attended Howell\u2019s school in Denbigh, north Wales, and then studied history and English at Newnham College, Cambridge.\nWhile at university, Miranda secured a holiday job in the cuttings library of the Manchester Guardian. There she met Hetherington, the paper\u2019s foreign editor, who soon afterwards, in 1956, became editor. Plunged almost immediately into the Suez crisis, Hetherington caused much controversy by taking a strong editorial line against the Eden government\u2019s military action in Egypt. The novice editor would later relate how Miranda gave him much moral support during a \u201cstrenuous and anxious time\u201d.\nAs soon as Miranda graduated the following summer, they married. Dorothy Macmillan, the wife of Harold Macmillan, the new prime minister, spotted their wedding photograph in the Guardian and invited them to No 10.\n\u201cIt was a happy lunch,\u201d Hetherington later wrote. \u201cMiranda, extremely good-looking and with a sharp mind, was a hit with Harold Macmillan.\u201d Partly as a result, Hetherington re-established amicable relations with Downing Street.\nIn the early years of their marriage, Miranda spent much of her time with their four children in Manchester, while the Guardian moved its base to London in the early 1960s. It meant much commuting for Alastair.\nThe Hetheringtons moved permanently to London in 1964, and bought a house in Blackheath. Miranda would play hostess to influential dinner guests, who often included senior politicians, and they also held huge parties for Guardian staff, which spread out on to Blackheath itself, and involved football matches that lasted many hours.\nMiranda got involved in several causes, including a charity for prisoners\u2019 wives, and completed a course in social work at Goldsmiths\u2019 College (now Goldsmiths, University of London). When Alastair retired from the Guardian in 1975, and moved to become controller of BBC Scotland, she chose to stay in London.\nAlastair\u2019s absences, late nights and interrupted weekends had taken their toll. And Miranda sought a career of her own. \u201cThat I understood,\u201d Alastair remarked poignantly in his memoirs, \u201cthough I would not have accepted the BBC offer if I had known that she might not come north.\u201d They divorced in 1978.\nMiranda went to work for the Probation Service. Having started with a probation officer\u2019s usual workload with convicted criminals, she later served as a court welfare officer, dealing with custody disputes and difficult criminal cases. Eventually, after breaks to care for her elderly parents, Miranda gave up probation work to concentrate on her passion for sculpture. She was successful enough to sell some of her work and received several special commissions.\nIn 1982 Miranda married John Beavis, a fellow probation officer. They enjoyed gardening and the theatre together.\nHe died in 2008. Miranda is survived by her children, Tom, Alex, Lucy and Mary, five granddaughters and five grandsons.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nOne of the great pleasures of this season of Pinter\u2019s shorter plays is that it reveals unexpected links. The Room (1957) and Family Voices (1981) are not only separated by time.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe former was written for Bristol students, the latter for BBC radio. Yet seeing them together in Patrick Marber\u2019s production, as part of Pinter Five, you realise they are both about reclusive figures dealing with the demands of family. For all the tonal variety of Pinter\u2019s plays, there is an extraordinary imaginative unity.\nWhat strikes one most about Marber\u2019s version of The Room is the pervasive fear. The fingers of Jane Horrocks as the immured Rose are forever nervously clutching the backs of chairs. Even Nicholas Woodeson as her supposed landlord seems paralysed by terror when he announces she has a visitor. When Riley (played by Colin McFarlane) turns up, the fact that he is black and blind unleashes even greater panic. Yet Pinter once told me he saw Riley as a redemptive figure, and Horrocks\u2019s seeming surrender to his request to return home, as well as the way his stick resembles a shepherd\u2019s crook, gives the play a strangely spiritual quality.\nThe idea that one can never escape the claims of kith and kin also animates Family Voices.\nOn radio, it all takes place in the consciousness of a young man who imagines the letters he might exchange with his mother. In Marber\u2019s bold staging, Luke Thallon as the son vividly impersonates the eccentric figures in the Dickensian lodging house he inhabits, including a highly sexual girl and a predatory guy named Riley. But when Thallon finally assures Horrocks as his estranged mother that he is coming back one hears uncanny echoes of The Room. Nostalgia, in the original sense of a return home, is the key to both works.\nThey are teamed with a hilariously macabre revival of Victoria Station (1982), in which McFarlane gives a brilliant display of baffled rage as the controller of a minicab firm desperately trying to communicate with Rupert Graves as a wayward driver.\nThe idea that Pinter\u2019s plays are full of hidden connections is richly confirmed by the works in Pinter Six. I myself once paired Party Time (1991) with Celebration (2000) in a drama school production partly on the pragmatic grounds each play had nine characters. But Jamie Lloyd\u2019s exuberant revival reminds us they are even more strongly riveted because both are about the insulation from reality of the super-rich.\nParty Time is the more overtly political in that a group of wealthy materialists rattle on about their new health club, seemingly oblivious to the roundup of dissidents on the streets outside. As staged by Lloyd, with the characters lined up facing the audience, it resembles a cocktail party from hell. Celebration is much wilder and funnier in its exposure of the coarseness of a group of rich diners in a posh London restaurant. Lloyd pushes it to the limits creating an air of drunken frenzy, and there are exemplary performances by Ron Cook as the rampantly misogynist host, John Simm as an oily banker and Katherine Kingsley as his mutinous wife. But Abraham Popoola, who plays a tortured victim in Party Time, reappears as an interventionist waiter, reminding us that there is a world elsewhere and that Pinter\u2019s plays are all cut from the same imaginative cloth.\n At the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 26 January. Pinter at the Pinter runs until 23 February.",

        "content": "As Donald Trump and Xi Jinping prepare to meet over the tariff war, both sides need a solution\nFor the US it was a wake-up call. Convinced that it was a world leader in the knowledge economy, the US was shaken out of its complacency when its communist rival announced a breakthrough in space exploration.\nMore than six decades separates the launch in 1957 by the Soviet Union of Sputnik \u2013 the first artificial satellite \u2013 and China\u2019s success last week in being the first country to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, but the same question is posed by the two events: is US economic hegemony at risk?\nIn the late 1950s the answer was no, although many Americans thought otherwise. Congress declared a national education emergency, federal funding for science was tripled and President Dwight Eisenhower paved the way for the Apollo moon landings by setting up the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \u2013 better known as Nasa.\nEventually, the US stopped panicking. The Soviet Union had a good, basic education system, excellent scientists, and was globally competitive in some specific manufacturing sectors but its command economy was incapable of delivering the living standards enjoyed in the capitalist west. Economic sluggishness brought about its collapse little more than 30 years after the launch of Sputnik.\nChina poses a much more realistic threat. For a start, it has posted four decades of staggeringly high growth, which has resulted in rapid improvements in living standards and victory in the battle against extreme poverty.\nWhat\u2019s more, the caricature of China as a country that just makes cheap goods for the west is out of date. In some areas of the digital economy \u2013 e-commerce and mobile payments for example \u2013 China is a world leader. The authorities in Beijing have ambitious plans for artificial intelligence and the use of big data.\nWhile the US still leads the way in the knowledge economy, China comes second in terms of research and development spending and, mindful of the pollution affecting its cities, has been investing impressively large sums into green technologies.\nChina has also developed in its own way. Liberalisation has been slow and careful. The state is firmly in charge of economic management. The overall approach is top down, authoritarian and target driven. One reason that the country is making progress in big data is that little heed is paid to the rights of the individual to privacy when collecting information.\nSooner or later China was bound to lock horns with the US. It is a fast-growing country; it wants to compete in cutting-edge technologies; it has a rival ideology; and, despite regular predictions of impending doom, it shows no sign of a Soviet Union-style collapse. Washington has long seen Beijing as an economic, political and military rival, but it has taken the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House to bring those fears to the surface. The tit-for-tat tariff war launched by the US last year is about far more than trade.\nChina badly wants to de-escalate the tension. Its economy has clearly been slowing and it is only able to hit official growth targets of 6%-plus by counting wasteful investment. Stripped of the creative accounting, the economy\u2019s trend growth rate is around 3%.\nThe aim is to steer the economy away from its dependency on investment and exports, but this is proving hard to achieve. China\u2019s fast growth over the past four decades has been based on moving the population out of low-productivity jobs in agriculture into higher productivity jobs in manufacturing \u2013 a process that can only happen once and is now over. Transition to a consumer-led, service-driven economy requires some short-term pain: unprofitable enterprises going bust, factories closing down and unemployment rising.\nXi Jinping, China\u2019s strongman leader, certainly does not want his authoritarian rule threatened by economic and social unrest, so every time growth slows down Beijing tightens political control while simultaneously using lower interest rates, easier credit, tax cuts and higher public investment to boost growth. This helps stabilise the economy but at the cost of keeping alive an economic model that the authorities know has to change.\nIn his book on China*, the economist George Magnus questions whether it is possible for a one-party state like China to make the switch from an economy where the government makes all the key decisions to one that encourages the development of new ideas. \u201cBehind a wall of censorship, a surveillance state is developing rapidly that may be very effective at gathering information but also quite stifling in terms of creativity and disruption \u2013 phenomena in which the west has traditionally enjoyed strong advantages.\u201d\nThe monetary stimulus provided in 2018 had little effect and exports growth is sagging as a result of slower global growth and US protectionism. That explains why high-level talks to end the US-China trade conflict are taking place in Beijing this week. Xi has blinked first in the standoff with Trump by offering easier access to the Chinese market for US exporters, because the US is a much more important market for China than China is for the US. Ultimately, the US can get the goods it currently sources in China from elsewhere. For its part, China simply cannot afford to be frozen out of the US market.\nThat said, Trump also seems keen that this week\u2019s talks succeed and not just because protectionism hurts the US as well as China. It is also because China matters in a way that the Soviet Union never did. The recession in Russia that followed the collapse of communism was deep but essentially a regional affair. A full-blown recession in China, as Trump is aware, would have profound implications for the US and the rest of the global economy.\n* Red Flags: Why Xi\u2019s China Is in Jeopardy, by George Magnus; Yale University Press",

        "content": "A 35-year-old man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of the murder of Lee Pomeroy on Guildford to London service\nDetectives have been given another 12 hours to question a man arrested over the fatal stabbing of a 51-year-old father on a London-bound train on Friday.\nThe 35-year-old was arrested in the early hours of Saturday, along with a 27-year-old woman, accused of assisting an offender, after a manhunt led police to a flat in Farnham.\nLee Pomeroy, from Guildford, had been taking his son, 14, on a trip to London when he was stabbed to death in what relatives described as a \u201chorrific and pointless attack\u201d.\nBritish Transport Police said on Sunday that investigators had been granted another 12 hours to question the arrested pair. Both remain in custody.\nDescribing Pomeroy as a \u201cdevoted family man\u201d, his family said in a statement issued on Saturday: \u201cLee took his son on a trip to London hoping to spend some quality time with him which was cut short by an horrific and pointless attack. Lee would have had his birthday today but did not get to see his presents.\n\u201cHe was an honest, bright person who loved music very much. He knew history and art and was a bachelor of science in maths. He was a devoted family man and did everything for his family.\n\u201cHe was a loving husband and father. He will be deeply missed by all his family.\u201d\nHe lived in Guildford with his wife, Svetlana Pomeroy, 50, and their son. The couple reportedly both worked for Datronix Systems Ltd, an IT consultancy, where he was a programmer and director.\nHe and his son had boarded the 12.58 train service between Guildford and London Waterloo at London Road station on Friday afternoon, alongside the arrested man.\nAccording to witnesses the men were involved in a three-to-four minute row, moving through the carriage and into another before the attack.\nThe suspected killer fled the train at Clandon station. The train continued to Horsley station where police and paramedics attended.\nThe suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder at 6am on Saturday at a flat near Farnham hospital, along with the 27-year-old woman. Residents said she and her child lived at the flat with the suspect.\nOne neighbour, Grant Christy, told the Press Association he witnessed the police breaking into the building, taking a couple into custody and leading a young child from the house. Describing the raid, he said: \u201cAt six they smashed the door down, woke me up immediately, obviously.\n\u201cInitially I just heard the banging. Sounded like someone trying to kick the door in.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThen I heard the police shouting \u2018Put your hands up, turn around\u2019, all that sort of thing and then it went quiet.\u201d\nPolice said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the killing.\nDetectives are continuing to appeal for information and have asked anyone who was on the train at the time, or who has dash-cam footage of the Clandon area after 1pm on 4 January, to contact them.",

        "content": "Pep Guardiola revised his philosophy as the champions\u2019 physical display secured a vital win to end Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten run\nWhen Crystal Palace visit Anfield in a couple of weeks Roy Hodgson will doubtless be reminded of his pre-Christmas remark \u2013 a slightly tactless one for a former Liverpool manager \u2013 that a four-point gap at the top of the table was nothing for Pep Guardiola to worry about.\nThat may still be the case, with 17 rather than 20 games left, though what Guardiola would really appreciate from Hodgson is the sort of Palace display against Liverpool that took the points at the Etihad and spooked Manchester City to such an extent they went on to lose their next game against Leicester.\nNo one was expecting that; City suddenly falling to back-to-back defeats against sides outside the top six amounted to the sort of vulnerability it was imagined had been abolished at the Etihad, even after the first setback of the season at Chelsea. The knock-on effect was considerable, with Tottenham rediscovering their propensity for bottling it on the big stage when they woke up to find themselves Liverpool\u2019s main title rivals, and J\u00fcrgen Klopp having to insist after beating Arsenal that a double-digit lead over the defending champions at the end of December was not necessarily an occasion for putting out bunting.\nSo it has proved by early January, a game in hand and a head-to\u2011head victory having brought City right back into the picture. The question for the rest of the league season is which City we are going to see, working on the assumption that Liverpool will remain fairly consistent. That may seem a large assumption to make but to get to where they are at the moment Liverpool have improved by 13 points on where they were at this stage of last season, whereas City were still unbeaten in the league after 21 games 12 months ago and consequently nine points better off than they are now. Klopp claims Liverpool this season have not yet been seen at their best, and he may be right, though they are regularly playing and picking up points in the manner he demands. While they may still be a work in progress, not quite the finished article, Liverpool are recognisably a Klopp team now and unlikely to react to their first defeat of the season by departing from the script and losing a couple more of their upcoming games.\nThat is what City did, and that is why all the pre-Christmas predictions of a relentless march to the title and a team close to perfection have had to be hastily revised. Even when keeping the title race alive by beating Liverpool in the last game, City displayed some most un-Guardiola-like characteristics, using a centre-half at left-back and bringing in Vincent Kompany to lead a back-line determined to give the ball some welly.\nOn the positive side Guardiola set out his stall to match Liverpool\u2019s spirit and physical intensity and achieved a notable victory. To be slightly more critical, City would have been in trouble had Kompany been dismissed for his lunge on Mohamed Salah, as he certainly could have been. City have not been noted in the Guardiola years for physical intensity and, though it brought a result in an important game, it was slightly odd to see the manager adapt his principles so significantly. Kompany, for instance, had not started a game against top-six opponents since last season. For a coach fond of preaching the virtues of stability this was close to chopping and changing, even if he was fully vindicated by the win.\nSo it should be interesting, to say the least, to see how Guardiola approaches the rest of the season. It has been pointed out that most of his titles in other leagues have been processions rather than fights, with peak Barcelona and Bayern Munich rarely having to come from behind, though the City manager has just answered any critics who thought he might shrink from confrontation.\nKlopp, on the other hand, may not need to alter his approach too much. If there were a few problems in defence on Thursday it was because players such as Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Leroy San\u00e9 and Raheem Sterling are good enough to ask questions of most defences. Liverpool do not have to play City every week and, when they face less stellar opponents, the chances are that Salah and Roberto Firmino will shine again and Virgil van Dijk will return to being imperious in defence. That is the theory, anyway, though one can readily understand Liverpool supporters feeling anxious until upcoming fixtures against bogey teams in Palace and Leicester are out of the way.\nWhile this might turn into the closest title race for several years it is worth bearing in mind that it will not take place in isolation. Both City and Liverpool will be involved in the knockout rounds of the Champions League from February onwards, both have FA Cup third-round games this long weekend and City will shortly have a Carabao Cup semi-final to deal with. Fighting on all fronts is a high-risk strategy, though City have the squad for it, particularly when Kevin De Bruyne makes a full return from injury.\nKlopp is already being implored by some Liverpool fans to give his youths and reserves an outing at Wolves in Monday\u2019s Cup tie, yet inevitably Europe will cast the biggest shadow over the title race. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho used to maintain that reaching the last eight of the Champions League was the minimum requirement for any club wishing to regard itself as a big player in Europe and for differing reasons City and Liverpool will probably want to go further than that.\nGuardiola is aware the City hierarchy view success in Europe as the ultimate goal, even if many others at the club would gladly swap it at this point for another domestic title. Liverpool have been seen at their best and worst in Europe this season but appear incapable of taking the challenge lightly, even with the possibility of a first title in 29 years on the horizon. Liverpool fans, in particular, might feel it is worth sacrificing everything to concentrate on league progress for the rest of this season, though in reality that is usually much easier said than done and the chances of ending up with nothing are high.\nFirst things first, though: now we know how quickly a 10-point gap can erode, the next instalment of rare and welcome excitement at the top of the Premier League revolves around seeing whether a four\u2011point lead will last to the middle of next month.",

        "content": "The Premiership clubs have moved to play down reports of a breakaway league and \u201ca war\u201d with the Rugby Football Union over ringfencing but relegation from the top flight remains a thorny issue for both parties.\nIt emerged on Sunday that last April the club owners discussed the possibility of an \u201cunregulated competition\u201d if the RFU does not agree to scrap promotion and relegation. It is a nuclear option and highly unlikely to materialise \u2013 not least because it would jeopardise the eight-year Professional Game Agreement (PGA) signed by the clubs and the RFU in 2016, which guarantees Premiership Rugby \u00a330m a year and England access to their players.\nThe clubs have long since been exploring ways to ringfence the top flight, however, and ultimately require the RFU\u2019s approval to do so. Furthermore, some clubs, emboldened by the \u00a3230m investment from CVC, want to ringfence sooner rather than later but it is believed there is a degree of reluctance from the RFU to agree. Its stance may have softened in recent years \u2013 ironically when Premiership Rugby\u2019s chairman, Ian Ritchie, was the RFU\u2019s chief executive he was steadfastly against ringfencing \u2013 but the union does not want to be seen to be killing the aspirations of teams below the Premiership.\nIt is also considered the union\u2019s most powerful bargaining chip with the Premiership clubs. In 2017 the RFU agreed to get rid of the Championship play-offs having been afforded more access to England players as part of the PGA. If the RFU agrees to get rid of promotion and relegation now, however, it has little left to bargain with in the future.\nboth Ritchie and the RFU confirmed no proposals have yet been made. Ritchie told the BBC: \u201cLike any board, you would expect all boards to discuss issues like Premiership promotion and relegation, and we\u2019ve been doing that for some time. To be clear, we\u2019ve got an eight-year agreement with the RFU \u2013 we work very closely in partnership with them \u2013 and we\u2019ve not put any proposals to them about this yet. And nor have we finalised our own, so I think what we need to do is consider this further. And I think it\u2019s a bit precipitous to say that there\u2019s a rift between us because we\u2019ve not had the discussions yet.\u201d\nThere may be some acceptance that ringfencing in the longer term is inevitable \u2013 the RFU\u2019s interim chief executive, Nigel Melville, last month suggested a 16-team two-conference format \u2013 but the union does not want to be dictated to by the clubs. When last month it emerged some clubs wanted to introduce ringfencing as early as this season Melville\u2019s response was pointed. \u201cI think that\u2019s called wishful thinking isn\u2019t it? Suddenly people want something to happen now. Well no, that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d",

        "content": "From shark swims to snow leopard treks, a tailored trip of up to a year is now a must-have\nThe super-rich are going on sabbatical. It turns out having bucket-loads of money can be stressful, leading some of the world\u2019s richest people to take a break for a month or so, or even a year, to escape the pressure of managing their businesses or personal fortunes.\nTom Barber, the founder of the London-based travel agency Original Travel, said so many super-rich customers had asked his firm to arrange bespoke trips ranging in duration from one to 12 months that his firm was launching a special division dedicated to sabbaticals for the 1%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge trend,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThe wealthy are looking for an escape. Often they want to get some sense of a back-to-basics lifestyle and learn the skills of our ancestors, like how to hunt and cook their own food.\n\u201cFor others, it\u2019s \u2018braggability\u2019. They want to use their money to open doors that normal people can\u2019t and to tell their friends all about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the 0.01%, you are going to be a competitive type of person.\u201d\nThese are no ordinary holidays. Recent trips Barber\u2019s firm has arranged include snow leopard spotting in India, living with the S\u0101n people in Botswana and diving with sharks in the \u201csardine run\u201d off the coast of South Africa.\nBarber said his company had arranged 80 sabbatical trips lasting at least a month over the past six years, with a significant jump in bookings last year. High-end travel agents in the US have reported a similar trend and also launched sabbatical booking services.\nBarber said most of the bookings were for a month or two, but he had arranged a year-long break for a 45-year-old billionaire who had sold his startup and wanted \u201csome time to reconnect with this family\u201d. The trip cost well in excess of \u00a31m.\nThe family visited 65 countries \u2013 from Mauritius to Bhutan, Antarctica\n and Greenland. \u201cThe guy was burnt out,\u201d Barber said. \u201cHe wanted to see the world, get back to basics a bit and most importantly see more of his kids, who he hadn\u2019t seen so much of when he was working to sell his company.\u201d\nA team of agents helped arrange the trip for the billionaire, including applying for visas and fixing up local guides in each country. Flights were the one thing Barber\u2019s team did not need to worry about, as the family\u2019s pilot flew them on their private jet.\nIncluded on the family\u2019s itinerary was tracking snow leopards in Ladakh, north-west India. \u201cThey really wanted to see them, but didn\u2019t want to wait there for 10 days and not actually see a snow leopard,\u201d Barber said. So his firm hired a team of local spotters and a helicopter to whisk the family from their luxury encampment the minute the elusive big cats were spotted.\nThe family also spent time with the S\u0101n indigenous hunter-gatherers in Botswana, where they learned how to hunt and cook their own food, and live without money. They also dived the sardine run off South Africa, where billions of sardines migrate up the east coast attracting huge numbers of predators, including sharks and dolphins.\nThey were joined in the dive by a professional documentary team, who helped the family film their experience. \u201cThey then showed them how to edit the rushes and make their own mini-film,\u201d Barber said. \u201cAn overwhelming element is the super-rich want to learn new skills. Sitting on a super-yacht in the sun is pretty old-school these days \u2013 people want to have adventures and learn new things.\u201d\nAs well as arranging the visas, logistics, guides and activities, Barber\u2019s firm also built a website for the family so that their friends back home could keep tabs on them.\nBarber said planning for the trip started with: \u201cA big map of the world in our conference room in Battersea [south London]. Our experts put pins in where they thought some of the best options were and we put a list of suggestions to the family.\u201d\nHe said the super-rich often take their families on sabbatical in order to show them \u201chow real people live\u201d and to learn the power and importance of money. \u201cThey want their children to see some real life, but in a safe and secure way,\u201d he said.\nIn the US, the number of super-rich sabbaticals had \u201cgrown exponentially in the last couple of years\u201d, said Jack Ezon, the president of Ovation Travel Group in New York. He said each year his firm arranged 50-60 sabbaticals lasting a month a month and five-10 lasting 12 months.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to restart or refresh your life,\u201d he said.\nEzon said many of his clients booking long sabbaticals were entrepreneurs who had sold their businesses and were looking for a proper break. \u201cIt is often tech guys who have floated or sold their companies and are thinking \u2018I have a two-year non-compete clause, what am I going to do with my time?\u2019 For others it is often when their kids are about to go on to college or high school, and they suddenly think \u2018I need to really be spending time with them.\u2019\u201d\nA US executive living in Mexico, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian he was setting off on a seven-month sabbatical with his wife and two children next month. The family are planning on driving from Punta Arenas, at the very southerly tip of Chile, back to their home in Mexico.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shipped our vehicle down to the very south of Chile, and fitted it out for an extreme adventure, with a tent on the roof and full suspension,\u201d he said. First the family will head to Antarctica, before driving up the Andes, stopping off to trek to Machu Picchu in Peru and to dive the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\n\u201cMy wife and I decided that we had to do this now, to spend some intensive time with our kids before it was too late,\u201d he said. \u201cMy eldest is about to turn 13 and the youngest is nearly 10.\u201d\nThe kids will miss more than half a year\u2019s schooling. The executive and his wife, who both have experience teaching, plan to home school or \u2013 \u201cvan school\u201d, as he puts it \u2013 the children.\nChildren\u2019s education is often a stumbling block in people\u2019s sabbatical plans, but there are a number of ways around the problem if you have the money, said Ezon. \u201cWe have a roster of teachers and retired teachers that we can suggest to families to take with them on their trips,\u201d he said.\nHe said long trips can easily become very expensive, but \u201cthese are very, very wealthy people and they can afford it. It could be a couple of million dollars to take your family around the world with a teacher in tow.\u201d",

        "content": "After battles with injuries, Chris Sutton and half of Glasgow, the Socceroos\u2019 Asian Cup title defence got off to the worst possible start with an opening 1-0 defeat to Jordan in Al Ain that leaves Graham Arnold\u2019s side facing an uphill battle to qualify from a competitive Group B.\nAnas Bani Yaseen was given acres of space by a napping Australian defence to thump a first-half header past Mat Ryan and score what proved to be the only goal of the game at Hazza bin Zayed Stadium.\nThe Socceroos had looked composed in the opening 10 minutes, despite sporting a makeshift attack, depleted further by the loss of Andrew Nabbout after a groin twinge a day before. But Jordan, despite picking up just one win from their previous nine international fixtures, stood their ground and before too long, the reigning champions began to feel the pressure.\nThree of the Socceroos\u2019 starters did not play a single minute at the World Cup in Russia \u2013 Jamie Maclaren, Massimo Luongo and Awer Mabil \u2013 and only Mabil looked capable of stretching and manipulating the Jordanian defence. The 23-year-old was the first to threaten with a 13th-minute strike that was pulled wide of the far post after an intelligent run through the left channel.\nBut Australia created little outside of that. Jordan\u2019s midfield and defensive lines were impossible to separate as Tom Rogic, Robbie Kruse and Maclaren were unable to get any meaningful touches in dangerous positions. Jordan\u2019s coach Vital Borkelmans had noted pre-game he planned to nullify the threats of Mark Milligan and Luongo and their attempts to spray passes into attacking midfield.\nJordan were buoyed by rapturous support of ex-patriate fans, whose numbers were reportedly bolstered through ticket giveaways. It produced a one-sided atmosphere, potentially influential when reflecting upon Australia\u2019s defeats in their two previous visits to Amman.\nOn the pitch, Jordanian organisation in central areas forced Australia wide, where Josh Risdon and Aziz Behich bombed forward from full-back. But they were unable to force their opposite numbers into mistakes, and instead were left out of position in their own defensive transition as Jordan broke with speed through the dangerous Musa Al-Taamari \u2013 star of Cypriot first division club APOEL. Risdon was replaced at half-time.\nJordan\u2019s lead \u2013 a deserved one \u2013 came midway through the first half as Al-Taamari\u2019s delightful corner found the unmarked Anas Bani Yassen at the near post.\nA goal to the good, Jordan continued to harass any Australian player attempting to penetrate through the middle of the park. Khalil Bani Ateyah was monstrous in his personal efforts to close down potential passing lanes and break up play. Time wasting also played its part in stymying Australia\u2019s rhythm as they tried to claw their way back into the contest.\nJordan continued to ask questions in the second half, but the Socceroos themselves started to impose their own will. The introductions of Rhyan Grant and Chris Ikonomidis \u2013 who replaced Robbie Kruse \u2013 showed that Arnold was willing to react to the obvious problems that existed on the field. For Risdon and Kruse, their starting roles for the second group stage game will be under threat.\nGrant immediately concerned himself with counter-attacking opportunities while providing his own incisive threat from the right. Ikonomidis also looked like a viable threat in the box, but the lack of reliable goalscorers in the team was a clear issue. Those players who took part in the game have a combined 34 goals at international level. Meanwhile, the last active Socceroo to score a goal in a competitive fixture before this game was Kruse, who netted in the first leg of Australia\u2019s World Cup qualification play-off against Syria \u2013 six games and over 12 months ago.\nRogic\u2019s inability to hit the target after Behich created one of the Socceroos\u2019 few clear-cut chances was symbolic. Gone are the days of the once ever-present Tim Cahill. A vociferous penalty shout towards the end of the first half and a thunderous Mabil strike that smashed against the post were the only other times the Socceroos threatened to score until two late chances fell their way.\nIn the dying minutes an equaliser was chalked out for offside \u2013 Maclaren strayed marginally in front of the last man \u2013 before the striker\u2019s search for his first international goal was prolonged in the final second of the game by an inspired Amer Shafi.\nArnold was bullish on suggestions his side were unable to create chances. \u201cWe gave away a sloppy goal and started slowly, in the second half we totally controlled the game and on any other day we could have scored and won the game.\u201d\nHe also dismissed the suggestion that his side\u2019s approach to the game was arrogant, having previously stated that he expected his side to beat Jordan.\nArnold now has numerous selection headaches heading into Australia\u2019s next fixture against Palestine in Dubai on 11 January although he remained coy on potential changes to the starting XI. He said that the Socceroos will \u201cdust ourselves off, recover well and mentally prepare\u201d for the next game. \u201cIt is a bit early to talk about changes,\u201d he added. He did note however, that Risdon suffered an injury which forced his half-time withdrawal, but did not state whether he would be ready by Friday.",

His background is in a certain kind of fashionable radicalism, set on exposing liberal hypocrisy from an anticapitalist perspective. One of his previous books was entitled The Corruption of Malcolm Gladwell, which portrayed the celebrated New Yorker writer as a shill for big pharma and the tobacco industry.\nHis polemical method is to assemble all the supporting evidence he can find for his thesis and skirt round or dismiss anything that gets in its way. His latest book targets the tech industry, which, let\u2019s face it, is a massive and deserving target. But he\u2019s less concerned about surveillance capitalism per se than what he sees as a weaponised front in the west\u2019s battle for hegemony and control.\nEntitled Surveillance Valley, the book\u2019s subtitle is The Secret Military History of the Internet, and this is the focus of Levine\u2019s often diligent investigations. It\u2019s no secret that the internet grew out of Arpanet, an early computer network that was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 an arm of the US defence department.\nLevine argues that weaponisation was encoded in the internet from the outset, and that Google, Facebook and Amazon have all played a role in supporting the US government\u2019s aggressive foreign policy. As he puts it: \u201cthe internet was developed as a weapon and remains a weapon today. American military interests continue to dominate all parts of the network, even those that supposedly stand in opposition.\u201d\nBut what does that actually mean? What are America\u2019s military interests? As Levine argues that Silicon Valley is so intertwined with the US military and intelligence agencies that it\u2019s hard to tell them apart, he makes little distinction between corporate and military agendas. Viewed from this perspective, Google\u2019s interests are one and the same as the Pentagon\u2019s, and America becomes one giant military-industrial complex seeking to impose free-market capitalism on the world.\nBy the same token, anyone who seeks to resist this global conspiracy becomes, in Levine\u2019s view, a doughty David against the American Goliath. This leads to some rather contorted double accounting. For example, Levine seems to be all for the cypherpunk movement of hackers, which seeks to expose powerful interests and fights for freedom from government surveillance. As long as it\u2019s in the west. Elsewhere, he takes a less sympathetic view.\nLevine tends to see the capitalised version of \u201cinternet freedom\u201d \u2013 the corporate effort to enable citizens of authoritarian regimes to enjoy the online liberties taken for granted by those in democracies (and, of course, expand potential markets) \u2013 as an attack on the sovereignty of countries such as China. Anti\u2011censorship becomes, in this context, not a cause but a weapon.\nThus Levine takes the CIA to task for funding Falun Gong, \u201ca controversial Chinese anti-communist cult\u201d, which he dismisses as a racist organisation of nutjobs (perhaps it is, but its beliefs are no more extreme than those of Scientology or the Nation of Islam). Yet he says nothing of the savage repression and human rights abuses to which its members have been subjected by the Chinese government.\nLevine seems appalled that Tor, the software enabling anonymous communication, was largely funded by the US government and has not provided foolproof anonymity \u2013 government agencies have used it to target al-Qaida followers.\nBut, as much as one may stand opposed to the kind of transgressions of data protection committed by both US governments and corporations, they surely have to be seen as less grievous than the wholesale control of information and persecution of dissent practised by the Chinese government.\nThere is a perfectly good argument contained in this book that the relationship between large internet corporations and US governmental agencies demands close scrutiny and criticism. But the attempt to characterise it as a giant military conspiracy is overwrought and not fully supported by the evidence.\nNever is this clearer than in Levine\u2019s conclusion, in which he travels to Mauthausen, a former Nazi concentration camp in Austria, where punch-card tabulators made by IBM were used to manage the system of slave labour.\nThe camp, he argues, is \u201ca powerful reminder of how computer technology can\u2019t be separated from the culture in which it is developed and used\u201d.\nWhile technically correct, it\u2019s an utterly spurious observation, like saying the use of railways to deliver prisoners to Auschwitz shows that transportation can\u2019t be separated from the culture in which it\u2019s used. Unfortunately, that kind of righteous bad faith is not restricted to the book\u2019s closing.\n Surveillance Valley by Yasha Levine is published by Icon Books (\u00a314.99).

        "content": "PM admits performance in England is slipping as she fails to promise targets will be met\nTheresa May has refused to guarantee that the NHS will get back to delivering A&E care, cancer treatment and planned operations within key waiting times despite its \u00a320bn a year funding rise.\nAsked on BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday whether the targets would be met in future, the prime minister admitted the NHS\u2019s performance was \u201cslipping\u201d and blamed its inability to provide those types of care within the maximum waiting times on the fast-growing pressures it is under.\nMay\u2019s failure to promise a return to the days when most hospitals in England met most key targets most of the time is at odds with her previous pledge that under the NHS long-term plan the service would once again hit the four-hour A&E target, give cancer patients urgent treatment within 62 days of referral and carry out non-urgent surgery within 18 weeks.\nIn a major speech last June setting out what the plan would deliver, May said: \u201cIt includes getting every part of the health service back on the path to delivering core performance standards so patients are never left waiting when they most depend on the NHS, whether that\u2019s for life-saving emergency care or treatment for cancer.\u201d\nBut she did not repeat that pledge to recover waiting times on Marr\u2019s show when she was discussing the long-term plan, which she and the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, will publish on Monday. It will set out the health service\u2019s priorities and plans for improvement until 2029.\nMay said: \u201cWhat we have seen in the NHS is that we are within those targets seeing more people and treating more people. We are slipping against the targets because despite the fact that we are doing more, demand is outstripping that.\u201d\nLabour seized on her refusal to assure patients that targets would again be hit, even though the NHS constitution makes clear that people seeking care must be able to rely on them.\n\u201cTheresa May has confirmed that thanks to nearly nine years of starving the NHS of cash, failing to recruit the staff needed and cutting public health budgets, the NHS won\u2019t even meet waiting time and access standards by 2029,\u201d said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary.\n\u201cThese constitutional standards were routinely met until 2010. Isn\u2019t that a damning admission of the extent to which the NHS has been run down and degraded under the Tories?\u201d\nOne leading NHS expert said the extra money May has pledged to give the service \u2013 3.4% annual rises in each of the next five years \u2013 would not be enough to realise her original ambition of it once again delivering waiting time standards.\n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s promises to improve mental health and other NHS services are welcome, but making them a reality will be extremely tough given growing pressures on services, chronic staff shortages, and cuts to other parts of the health and care system,\u201d said Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation thinktank.\n\u201cWhile \u00a320.5bn extra funding promised for NHS England by 2023-24 is generous compared with other public services, it is barely enough to keep pace with growing demand for care. This means trade-offs are inevitable, and these must be spelled out clearly so the public know what they can expect from the NHS.\u201d\nMay also appeared unable to explain why the government will have cut the public health budget in England by what the Health Foundation estimates is \u00a3900m between 2014-15 and 2019-20. Critics claim the cuts are a false economy as they create extra pressure on the NHS by reducing the help available for stopping smoking, healthy eating and physical activity programmes.\nShe suggested the NHS has the lead role on public health, even though the Conservative-led coalition government in which she was home secretary switched legal responsibility for that from the health service to local councils under the Health and Social Care Act 2012.\nIn a separate interview Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that Britain would continue to have unhindered access to medicines even if it left the EU on 29 March without a deal.\n\u201cWe are confident that if everybody does what they need to do then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA lot of this relies on the pharmaceutical companies and others, so it isn\u2019t entirely in the gift of the government, but we need to do what we need to do and the pharmaceutical industry. So far that work has been progressing very well, I\u2019ve been very pleased with the response of the pharmaceutical industry who obviously take this incredibly seriously.\u201d",

        "content": "The Arsenal manager, Joe Montemurro, expressed his frustration at conceding two goals as Arsenal had to come from behind at Rush Green to beat West Ham 4-2.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we copped two goals,\u201d said Montemurro. \u201cThey were set pieces, goal-kicks, and we\u2019ve not had a problem with those all season but for some reason we got our shape wrong. It\u2019s crazy but that\u2019s football.\u201d\nTwo goals from Dani\u00eblle van de Donk and a debut goal from Janni Arnth helped Arsenal make up for their defensive fragility to gain a second testing victory against the Hammers.\nAnd the manager was pleased with the performance of the Danish defender Arnth, who was handed her first start: \u201cIt was evident that she is an experienced defender. She controlled her area, her passing was fantastic, her final pass was fantastic and that\u2019s what we want.\u201d\nArnth has been brought in along with Katrine Veje from Montpellier to help shore up a heavily depleted squad. \u201cIt\u2019s well-noted the number of players we\u2019ve got in rehab and coming back,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cI think they were all sitting in the grandstand. There were seven of them. That\u2019s a million-dollar bench there. It\u2019s crazy. They\u2019re all slowly coming back.\u201d\nThe injury-hit Gunners\u2019 unbeaten run collapsed against their title rivals Manchester City at the start of December \u2013 their last league outing \u2013 and they needed a bright start. With Kim Little back in the starting XI 84 days after sustaining a broken tibia, and Arnth also on the pitch, the Arsenal lineup looked a little more robust after the winter break.\nA cautious opening 10 minutes was eventually enlivened by a West Ham goal. With Alisha Lehmann and Brianna Visalli putting in impressive shifts out wide in a front three, Lehmann\u2019s curling cross found the former Manchester City forward Jane Ross at the far post and she swept in to put the Hammers ahead.\nWest Ham\u2019s manager, Matt Beard, is also struggling with a lengthy injury list. \u201cThis game was probably a week too soon for us with the injuries that we\u2019ve got unfortunately; we had only one fit sub on the bench today,\u201d he said. \u201cThat highlights the issues we have. We had to adjust a few things. Yesterday Julia Simic broke down which was a big blow for us because she\u2019s been pulling the strings in midfield and we missed that a bit today, that little bit of composure, keeping the ball and linking up.\u201d\nBut with two signings coming in this week who will be available to face Manchester City next weekend, and having tested the league leaders, it is not all doom and gloom.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re looking at the champions in Arsenal. Both games this season we\u2019ve given them a run for their money. We can take a lot of heart from the performance today.\u201d\nBeth Mead\u2019s corner was powered into the top-right of Becky Spencer\u2019s goal off the head of her fellow England international Leah Williamson to give Arsenal their equaliser and the Gunners then cranked up the pressure. A Spencer double-save from Vivianne Miedema after some nice work by Mead on the left kept the sides level but moments later Arnth headed home from another Mead corner to give the visitors the lead.\nAs half-time approached, Arsenal were punished for their profligacy. A goal-kick from Spencer was flicked on by Visalli to Ross who, catching Katie McCabe out of position, sprinted clear and swept the ball past Pauline Peyraud-Magnin.\nUndeterred, Arsenal continued to raise the tempo after the break. In the 59th minute they regained the lead as a McCabe ball across goal found Van de Donk, who poked home at the back post.\nShe then took her WSL tally to 10 for the season. A cleared Mead corner was returned to the forward by Little and a second cross was headed home by Van de Donk.\nNext Sunday West Ham play title chasing Manchester City while Arsenal host Chelsea, who they put five past unanswered at Kingsmeadow. Will it be as easy? \u201cOf course not,\u201d said Montemurro. \u201cThey\u2019re in a good state, they\u2019re growing. We\u2019re still about two or three weeks from having a full squad. It\u2019s going to be a crucial match for us. We\u2019re playing at home which is really important for us but lets be honest, Chelsea are champions of England and a very very good team.\u201d\nManchester City fell two points behind leaders Arsenal, who have played a game less, as they were pegged back by Bristol City. Nikita Parris\u2019s 11th league goal of the season was cancelled out by Lucy Graham\u2019s second-half penalty after Jen Beattie caught her in the area.\nBeth England scored in the sixth minute before Chelsea ran out 3-0 victors over Everton. Drew Spence and Hannah Blundell\u2019s second-half goals secured victory. Chelsea remain third, five points off Arsenal.\nBirmingham kept pace with Chelsea after Meagan Sargeant headed in Lucy Staniforth\u2019s free-kick in the 89th minute at home to Reading. Kerys Harrop had opened the scoring but Remi Allen levelled things one minute before Sargeant\u2019s winner. Ini Umotong scored as Brighton defeated Liverpool 2-0 \u2013 their second win of the season.",

All four have pleaded not guilty.\nIt is part of the first criminal case in the UK to pursue senior bankers for events surrounding the financial crisis.\nBut the trial, which is expected to last at least 12 weeks and is scheduled to begin at Southwark crown court in London on Monday, will also put the SFO\u2019s reputation on the line, after two of its high-profile cases were scrapped this year alone.\nCharges against former Tesco executives, accused of being masterminds behind a major accounting scandal, were thrown out in December after a judge deemed the case too \u201cweak\u201d to face a jury. The SFO is believed to have spent about \u00a310m pursuing the former managers.\nThe SFO also saw its case against Barclays bank \u2013 which is separate to the case against the ex-bosses \u2013 over the Qatar fundraising dismissed by the court in Southwark last year. The SFO later lost a high court appeal to reinstate those charges.\nThe court failures were embarrassing for the SFO, which also faced criticism for the collapse of a 2016 trial against brokers accused of helping the convicted trader Tom Hayes rig the Libor rate.\nThe SFO\u2019s original charges against Barclays and the former executives followed a five-year investigation into the details of the rescue package secured over a decade ago.\nThe cases relate to a \u00a312bn rescue package provided by investors including Qatar Holdings in 2008, which helped Barclays avoid a government bailout during the banking crash. The investigation centred on a subsequent $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan to state-owned Qatar Holdings, which was allegedly used to buy Barclays shares in what the SFO says amounted to unlawful financial assistance.\nThe charges against the four former executives were first made public in 2017, with Varley losing two major board positions following the SFO\u2019s announcement. The 62-year-old promptly stepped down from the board of asset manager BlackRock that summer, and was also replaced as the chairman of the Marie Curie cancer charity.\nVarley was a Barclays stalwart, having joined in 1982. He also had close familial ties with the bank after marrying Carolyn Pease, whose Quaker family sold their own bank to Barclays in the early 1900s. He served as chief executive from 2004 to 2010.\nJenkins, the former investment banking head who is also facing charges, was once believed to be Britain\u2019s highest-paid banker, earning \u00a340m per year, and was best known for setting up the bank\u2019s controversial tax advisory business, which was later wound down. He left Barclays in 2009.\nKalaris left Barclays in 2013, but went on to co-found the wealth management firm Saranac Partners three years later. Boath, meanwhile, stayed on at Barclays until 2016 but claimed he was unfairly dismissed over an interview he gave the SFO during its investigation into the Qatar deal. The employment tribunal is on hold until the SFO case is settled.\nBarclays still faces the threat of a \u00a31.5bn civil case over the Qatar funding later this year. The case is being brought by the businesswoman Amanda Staveley through her firm PCP Capital Partners, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit over the terms given to potential investors of the emergency fundraising. Barclays said in its annual report that it planned to defend itself against the claim, with the trial expected to start in October.",

        "content": "Locals furious over decision to close the pier for two months, a year after it won the Stirling prize\nThe battle of Hastings pier has erupted in public insults and accusations after a decision, announced at the end of December, to close the seaside town\u2019s prize-winning attraction for two months.\nFurious locals have accused owner Sheikh Abid Gulzar of keeping them in the dark over his plans for the pier\u2019s future after his sudden decision to shut it until March for repairs and improvements.\nGulzar responded saying campaigners had been rude and insulting and \u201cwanted everything for free\u201d.\nThe latest outbreak of hostilities, conducted mainly on social media, marks a new low in relations between campaigners and the owner. The warring sides have different visions for the pier, which won the prestigious Stirling prize for architecture in 2017.\nHastings residents accuse Gulzar of cheapening the listed Victorian structure with the installation of fibreglass animals, including an elk and a gold baby hippopotamus, and plans for an amusement arcade.\nJames Chang, of the campaign group Friends of Hastings Pier (FoHP), said locals wanted \u201csympathetic development\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not objecting to the development, we\u2019re objecting to the nature of development,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nIn an interview with BBC Sussex, Chang added: \u201cWhat we are asking for is transparency. We want to know the plans for the pier. We need to know that the pier is being well cared for and looked after. There\u2019s \u00a314m of public money that has been invested.\u201d\nGulzar, a hotelier and businessman who also owns Eastbourne pier, hit back, saying there had been arson attacks and thefts on the pier. He said a recent fire in the cafe was a close call.\n\u201cSafety is paramount. We have had one or two incidents that have frightened me \u2026had that fire happened early morning or late evening, the whole of that building would have gone up in flames,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cI will make sure this pier will be one of the best, but I will not tolerate any nonsense where people come and use swear words and want everything for free. The most important thing is to get on with this work. I will do everything right. I love Hastings, it\u2019s one of the best seafronts, but it should improve.\u201d\nSince it opened in 1872, Hastings pier has gone from Victorian pleasure park to popular music venue \u2013 which saw performances by Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones \u2013 to crumbling edifice that engineers described as \u201cone good storm away from collapse\u201d in 2009. It was extensively damaged by fire in 2010 and reopened in 2016 after a \u00a314m renovation paid for by the Heritage Lottery Fund. However, a local charity set up to run the pier went bankrupt in November 2017.\nFoHP raised around \u00a3750,000 in crowdfunding and put in an offer to buy the pier on behalf of the community, but to local fury, administrators sold it to Gulzar in June last year for \u00a360,000, according to Land Registry documents.\nOn a wintry day in Hastings, Peter Wheeler, the pier\u2019s former chief maintenance engineer, had a face as cloudy as the sky as he watched the wind and waves batter the structure. He and several other pier staff are taking legal action against Gulzar for constructive dismissal.\n\u201cAt the moment, there is no dedicated team available to work on Hastings pier. We had eyes on it every day, checking it, making sure bolts were tightened and things like that,\u201d Wheeler told the Guardian.\nHe said \u201cmalevolent acts\u201d had been taking place on and under the pier. \u201cSomeone has been climbing up underneath and unscrewing the sewage pipe caps. We spotted it and replaced them, but two days later the caps were taken again. You\u2019d have to be pretty nimble to climb up the underneath. It\u2019s malevolent, not just a jolly jape.\u201d\nWheeler insisted the pier needed constant maintenance, but accused Gulzar of closing it unnecessarily. \u201cThere\u2019s always maintenance to be done, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to shut the pier,\u201d he said.\nThe local MP, Amber Rudd, has expressed concern over the sudden closure, but Peter Chowney, Hastings borough council leader, said the authority had no direct control over Hastings pier.\n\u201cIt is privately owned, and the owner is entitled to adopt whatever opening hours he wants to,\u201d Chowney told the Hastings & St Leonard\u2019s Observer, adding that it was \u201cunfortunate that no prior notice was given\u201d and the closure \u201ccould have been handled better\u201d.\nGulzar\u2019s spokesman, Brett McLean, told the Guardian the essential repairs included rewiring and he hoped the pier could be opened by mid-February.\nHe said an engineering team based at Eastbourne was carrying out regular checks on the structure. At the weekend, pictures of engineers reportedly replacing a guard on one of the pier columns were published on the pier\u2019s Facebook page.\nMcLean added: \u201cThe personal attacks on Mr Gulzar are extremely unkind, unnecessary and unwanted, and as such are the shameful creation of a small but vocal minority \u2026 I am aware that the administrator\u2019s also received an incredible amount of abuse from, presumably, the same group of individuals.\u201d",

        "content": "Like all great tailors, Joe Casely-Hayford was an outsider who observed how men define their personal identities and pledge group allegiances; the personal is the political and there is nothing more personal than the four metres of cloth in the average male outfit. He liked to cite his great-grandfather Joseph Casely-Hayford\u2019s 1911 book, Ethiopia Unbound, because it was about \u201cduality and double-consciousness\u201d. Casely-Hayford\u2019s grandfather \u201cwore Kente cloth to study at Cambridge and Savile Row to visit family in Ghana\u201d.\nCasely-Hayford, who has died aged 62 after suffering from cancer, applied that inheritance of black insight \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re aware of both yourself and how you\u2019re viewed by the majority at all times\u201d \u2013 to everybody, through clothes, mediating between tradition and street cred, formal three-piece and sportswear.\nHis suits were worn by Bono and Gordon Brown; he was the first serious name to collaborate with Topshop, in 1993; and the first to make mini-ranges for middle Britain\u2019s redoubt, John Lewis. He adored the anarchic power of punk (its politics, not its binbags) and as creative director of the arch-Savile Row firm Gieves & Hawkes (2005-08) took it to the Paris catwalk. Mixing it: that was life and the future.\nHis father, Victor Casely-Hayford, a barrister from Ghana, had settled in the UK and he and his wife, Ransolina, expected much from Joe and his siblings, Gus, Peter and Margaret. Joe was not particularly academic and did not feel he belonged, \u201cso that made me interested in the cult of the individual. I wanted to create my own identity and that\u2019s what drew me into fashion\u201d. The rebellion was to cut his own gear from secondhand tat and wear Manolo Blahnik women\u2019s shoes.\nYet his higher education was as thorough as the family could have wished: the workshop of Doug Hayward, favourite of celebrities and workng-class dandies; the Tailor and Cutter Academy; and then fashion design at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, followed by history of art at the ICA. He knew how to set a sleeve head well before he met a theory.\nThe London fashion business was still informal in the 1980s, with low rents, low volume and a let\u2019s-make-it-right-here-on-the-kitchen-table attitude. Casely-Hayford\u2019s first brand, KIT, was just what it said on the label \u2013 army surplus canvas tents bought mouldering from a Bankside warehouse, bleached, distressed and cut up into garments.\nThat they were found in the Clink, SE1, mattered, because the cacophony of London always fed Casely-Hayford\u2019s creativity. He knew the East End best, because West End fashion had historically outsourced hand-finishing east to Whitechapel, so when he took cheap workspace in 1984 to design for his new Joe Casely-Hayford label, it was in Brick Lane, where inspiration walked past his door, \u201cmixing English-gentleman pieces with their religious clothing\u201d on the way to the mosque. Surplus supplies were dwindling, so he was among the earliest designers to look for quality piece goods still being millwoven in the UK, and from these he made his first collection.\nThe tailoring was old-school Savile Row, but the ideas were global, with sartorial jokes including shirts that buttoned back and front. Casely-Hayford stayed faithful to the East End, moving the studio to Shoreditch, and then tracking undeveloped zones up as far as Seven Sisters.\nHe had to expand, because everybody wanted his output or intervention. Before he even had a studio, he had styled for Island Records and the Clash came calling; U2 followed, as did Take That, Liam Gallagher, Lou Reed and Jarvis Cocker. He was on call 24/7 through the 80s and 90s for stage costumes and wedding suits, and also worked for magazines: \u201cWhen I saw the first issue of i-D, I saw people who were outsiders and that gave me hope in a socio-political sense. Prior to that, black people did \u2018black things\u2019.\u201d\nHe showed in Paris and Tokyo, sold in New York, and set up a 1995 Barbican Art Gallery exhibition on African textiles. Before that, he had not consciously brought Africa much into his work, but its fabrics had become as local to Kingsland Road, Hackney, as a Greggs bakery, so it joined the mix.\nThe label, which also produced womenswear, ran until 2005, when Casely-Hayford was recruited by Gieves & Hawkes to see if a heritage tailoring establishment could be modernised as couture houses had been. This meant questioning every pad and stitch and he transferred all that R&D over in 2009 into a new brand, its label, Casely-Hayford, standing for his work and that of his son and business partner, Charlie.\nThey survived in the relentless clothing industry (more collections, volume and hype) by careful withdrawal, sometimes designing on the way to Japan, where they cultivated factories sympathetic to their English style, defined by Casely-Hayford Sr as \u201ccountry estates and housing estates\u201d. Besides selling in the usual grand international venues, father and son opened a small, kindly shop in Marylebone.\nCasely-Hayford said that through his children (his daughter Alice works for British Vogue) he saw \u201cyou can be where you want to be now. Thirty years ago we were fighting for our self-expression \u2026 it was very difficult to operate outside those parameters.\u201d\nHe was appointed OBE in 2007.\nHis wife, Maria Stevens, whom he met at St Martin\u2019s and married in 1980, survives him, as do their children, Charlie and Alice, and his siblings.\n Joseph Ephraim Casely-Hayford, tailor and designer, born 24 May 1956; died 3 January 2019",

        "content": "In the 1990s, Goldsmiths college in London spawned the YBAs. Now, it has incubated a very different group \u2013 whose work is as likely to turn up in an international court as in a gallery\nUp a narrow staircase at the labyrinthine Goldsmiths college in London is an airy room where researchers, film-makers, AI experts, investigative journalists and archaeologists pore over computer screens. This is the nerve centre of Forensic Architecture, the research agency that was a strong contender for the 2018 Turner prize (they lost out to Charlotte Prodger) and which has gained a name for its meticulous \u201ccounter-forensic\u201d investigations into human rights abuses.\nIn this post-truth era, verification is paramount, so myriad documentation sources have to be corroborated in minute detail. On a recent visit I paid them, researchers were synchronising police bodycam film and extended thermal footage with film shot by an activist. Someone else was scrutinising CCTV footage connected to the recent unsolved murder of an LGBTQ activist in Greece. The investigative film-maker Laura Poitras was visiting and journalists from the New York Times had been over to learn about setting up a visual investigations unit. A team is currently training Chicago activists to respond to police violence.\nGoldsmiths is once again the incubator of a new movement, 30 years after Damien Hirst and his fellow students swaggered into British art history with the landmark exhibition Freeze. But where the Young British Artists were about ego and in-your-face art, with its sharks and suggestive arrangements of kebabs and fried eggs, this is collaborative, research based and politically committed, spanning architecture, journalism, law and science. As with all the most interesting movements, there\u2019s controversy over whether it\u2019s even art.\nThis movement has emerged and takes its name from the Centre for Research Architecture (CRA) at Goldsmiths. Research architecture has nothing to do with designing buildings but everything to do with the politics of space, especially how it is manipulated by states and corporations against civilians and the environment \u2013 from drone strikes in Pakistan to mining in the Amazon. Using sophisticated technologies such as remote sensing, 3D modelling and vessel-tracking, hard evidence of wrongdoing is gathered. The final work is as likely to be presented in an international court as in an art gallery. Evidence compiled by Forensic Architecture has been submitted to the International Criminal Court on Israel\u2019s 2014 assault on Gaza; to the Inter-American court on Guatemala\u2019s genocide; and to the European Court of Human Rights on Italy\u2019s role in migrant drowning deaths.\n\u201cWe are confrontational, interventional,\u201d says architect and activist Eyal Weizman, founder of Forensic Architecture, the most high-profile group to emerge from the CRA. As well as a research agency, Forensic Architecture has also evolved into an investigative, case-driven discipline within the broader field of research architecture. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea of really working as detectives,\u201d explains Lorenzo Pezzani, who has collaborated with the group and teaches a course in forensic architecture at the CRA.\nServing as a petri dish for this new field, the CRA was set up as a postgraduate faculty at Goldsmiths by Weizman in 2005. Fourteen years of experimentation later, it is, according to Polly Staple of the Chisenhale Gallery, one of the most important creative bases in the UK. \u201cIt offers,\u201d she says, \u201ca radically different position to that which is understood as \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 by mainstream media and the art market.\u201d\nThis is not an art destined for collectors\u2019 homes. It\u2019s not about beautiful paintings or even self-expression. Students and staff at the CRA are passionately confronting the power structures responsible for violence and destruction, employing multiple journalistic and technological tools to uncover hidden stories. They call themselves \u201cspatial practitioners\u201d rather than architects or artists, since exhibiting their films, images, installations and books in galleries is just one aspect of their work, which also includes teaching, collaborating with experts and ongoing research. Whether they\u2019re investigating claims of a so-called climate refugee community in Alaska threatened by the impact of global warming or Australia\u2019s violations against immigrants offshore, their aim is to effect political change.\nRecently, CRA graduate Lawrence Abu Hamdan staged a show that centred on the notion of \u201cear witness\u201d testimony. In 2016, Abu Hamdan worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty to conduct interviews with former detainees of Syria\u2019s notorious Saydnaya prison, where inmates are mostly kept in darkness and sound is used as a weapon of torture, about what they heard. The result of this collaboration was presented last year to a German prosecutor in a petition against the Syrian government. For his show, Abu Hamdan displayed a selection of objects such as a popcorn maker, a car door and cannelloni pasta as a sound effects library, objects which could make the sound of a punch, kick or gunshot.\nWhere Abu Hamdan explores audio, Alon Schwabe and Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez Pascual of the duo Cooking Sections look at the world through the lens of food. Their long-term project Climavore promotes the idea of adapting food production and consumption to climate change. Last year the pair built a structure in Skye that functions both as an oyster farm at high tide and a dining table at low tide, where convivial discussions are held with residents, farmers, politicians and fishermen about viable alternatives to Skye\u2019s damaging salmon farming industry. \u201cOne of the great things we learned at the centre was how do you really engage with these different stakeholders and agents working in the field?\u201d says Schwabe.\nThe centre grew out of the lack of an architecture discipline at Goldsmiths, but given the college\u2019s long history of experimentation and activism, it was never going to be a traditional course. \u201cThere was a sense that new social and political conditions were unfolding in which new practices and thinkers were urgently needed,\u201d says centre director Susan Schuppli, whose own practice explores the legal and aesthetic implications of damaged ecologies and pollution. Her recent project Nature Represents Itself used aerial, underwater and satellite imagery, as well as CGI simulation, to argue that the swirling oil slick from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico amounted to a kind of camera-less photography, a chemical reaction caused by hydrocarbon atoms interacting with water and sunlight.\nWeizman launched the centre as a peer-to-peer PhD programme and brought in like-minded thinkers such as curator Anselm Franke, film-maker Angela Melitopoulos and C\u00e9line Condorelli, an artist and architect. This first phase of the centre was known as Round Table One, because a huge round table was the gathering point for fierce debates among participants and guest speakers. They realised their combined intellectual resources could be a powerful practical tool. \u201cWhat made Round Table so unique was it didn\u2019t have to deliver architects,\u201d says Condorelli. \u201cArchitecture is very much a methodology used to look at the world, it\u2019s not an object of study at the CRA.\u201d\nSince those early days, CRA graduates have spearheaded innovations in diverse fields. Lebanese-British practitioner Helene Kazan is pushing to extend international law to further protect the individual in conflict zones. Her video Masking Tape Intervention: Lebanon 1989 takes as its starting point her father\u2019s photo of their kitchen with masking tape gridding the window to prevent shelling from shattering the glass during Lebanon\u2019s civil war. Paulo Tavares focuses on land and human rights violations in Amazonia, using complex mapping of plants and trees, as well as testimonies from indigenous communities, to argue for the forest to have legal rights as a civic entity.\nThe sea is the arena of Lorenzo Pezzani and film-maker Charles Heller, together known as Forensic Oceanography. Their 2011 project The Left-to-Die Boat drew on an astonishing array of surveillance tools to document the case of a distressed migrant boat from Libya that was left to drift for two weeks without intervention from nearby Nato vessels, resulting in the death of 63 migrants.\nFor its Turner prize show, Forensic Architecture\u2019s multimedia display unravelled the cover-up of the killing of a Bedouin Palestinian teacher by Israeli police during a demolition operation in a Bedouin village. \u201c[The police] were absolutely stunned by the level of analysis that was unleashed on the case. Never has there been a group of modellers, architects, sound analysts doing that. We just decided to focus on that case because we thought it was paradigmatic enough,\u201d says Weizman. Sifting through information displayed in film, maps, tweets and models is a big ask of the viewer, but it\u2019s impossible not to be gripped by the unfolding narrative that\u2019s all the more shocking because it\u2019s real.\nOf course the question that comes up from viewers \u2013 and even other artists \u2013 is: where\u2019s the art? One might trace research architecture\u2019s lineage to the protest art of the 60s, to social realism, to relational aesthetics, which focuses on social engagement, and to the activist strain of much post-internet art. But ultimately does it matter if it doesn\u2019t conform to conventional notions of art?\n\u201cWhat Forensic Architecture propose is a different language,\u201d says ICA director Stefan Kalm\u00e1r. \u201cIt\u2019s a different set of tools to understand the world and change perspectives. Is it art, journalism, documentary film-making, or architecture? Maybe it\u2019s all of the above or maybe it\u2019s a new art form. We don\u2019t know.\u201d\nIn fact, galleries can be vital forums for the public to access such evidence of state and corporate abuse. Thousands of people saw Forensic Architecture\u2019s exhibition at the 2017 art festival Documenta in Kassel, Germany, showing its investigation into alleged state collusion in a neo-Nazi racist killing in the city \u2013 which put pressure on the German parliamentary inquiry to accept their findings as evidence in the legal proceedings.\n\u201cEvery time we expose a violation, we crack a little bit the monopoly that states and governments think they have over information around incidents or around battlefields,\u201d says Weizman. \u201cThey think they control the space militarily, imagistically and analytically. Every time you break that, they need to realign, to change the ways they work.\u201d",

Another goal from Chhetri restored their lead before further strikes from Anirudh Thapa and Jeje rounded off the win in Abu Dhabi.\nChhetri moved onto 66 goals, one more than Messi.

Mitchell claims GRG conspired to push Torex Retail into administration before selling it off at a discount price in 2007.\nIn 2007 Mitchell was a whistleblower on an earlier fraud at the company, which resulted in the conviction of Mark Woodbridge, a former group financial accountant, who was jailed for more than three years.\nIn 2017 a high court judge dismissed Mitchell\u2019s lawsuit against RBS over the Torex episode, saying the case had no real prospect of success at trial.\nMitchell filed his legal application for the case against the FCA at the end of October 2018, and says he has more than 530 fellow complainants on board.\nThe FCA refused to comment on Mitchell\u2019s legal application while the decision is pending.\n\u201cOur statement in July explained that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA\u2019s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited,\u201d it said.\n\u201cAfter carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.\nWe will not comment on the application seeking to review this decision while it is pending.\u201d\nRBS declined to comment.",

        "content": "At Woking, they still talk about the FA Cup third-round win at West Brom in 1991, which was fired by Tim Buzaglo\u2019s hat-trick. It was surely the highlight of the non-league club\u2019s 130-year history, even if there have been other heady days in the Cup, including the third-round draw at Coventry in 1997, who were then in the Premier League.\nThis tie had the potential to top everything. Woking had never beaten top-flight opposition \u2013 West Brom were in the old Division Two when they were unhinged \u2013 but the Surrey club\u2019s fanbase had been overtaken by Cup fever. They could feel it was going to be their day.\nThen reality intervened. Watford took an early lead through Will Hughes and they were never extended. Troy Deeney, on as a second-half substitute, scored the second and it was difficult to pinpoint many moments when Woking threatened. Watford\u2019s superior class told.\nYet it was still a day to feel the glow of FA Cup romance. The competition is too predictable; it has had its day? Do not say that to Alan Dowson, the old-school Woking manager, whose north-east tones remain loud and proud. He talked of his thrill at seeing Kingfield sold out, of his young players coming up against established professionals (even if Javi Gracia made 11 changes to his Watford team) and of the uplift that the tie has brought to this corner of England.\nThe estimated \u00a3300,000 windfall will help, too, with Dowson saying it would allow him to \u201cbuild a club\u201d. Woking\u2019s annual player budget is roughly \u00a3300,000. Yet it was not long before Dowson moved into more light-hearted territory. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first thing I\u2019ll buy? A kettle for my office,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, I have to walk about 20 miles for a cup of tea. It took me three months to get a heater.\u201d\nIf Dowson is a throwback, then so was the feel of this afternoon. \u201cThe fan interaction when we walked from the team bus to the changing room \u2013 you don\u2019t get that in the Premier League,\u201d Tom Cleverley, the Watford midfielder, said. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice. All of us have come from working-class backgrounds and we\u2019ve gone out on loan to lower league clubs.\u201d\nFan interaction? \u201cIt was just the usual banter,\u201d Cleverley said, with a smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t take it too personally.\u201d Cleverley knows a bit about Woking. His great-uncle, Reg Stratton, was one of the club\u2019s greatest icons, having scored for them in their 1958 FA Amateur Cup triumph at Wembley.\nWoking sit second in the National League South, the sixth tier of the English game, while Watford are eighth in the Premier League and the gulf in technical quality was clear. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ball,\u201d Woking\u2019s fans chorused, ironically, in the 17th minute, which rather caught the mood.\nHughes\u2019s goal was superbly taken \u2013 a low finish whipped first-time into the bottom corner from Adam Masina\u2019s pull-back from a corner. It was, though, a soft one for Woking to concede. Watford did not have to work too hard to outmanoeuvre them.\nThe home crowd were all over any flicker from their players, who are part-time, training only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but there were not too many. Ben Gerring worked Heurelho Gomes with a first-half header while the substitute Harvey Bradley headed over late on.\nWatford could point to Isaac Success being denied by Craig Ross and Cleverley rattling the crossbar with a free-kick while they made sure of their progress when one substitute, Ken Sema, crossed for another, Deeney, to tap home.\nThere was a classic moment when Success accidentally bundled into the linesman, Stephen Child, to send him toppling over the advertising boards in front of Moaners\u2019 Corner. But the takeaway of the day? Surely Dowson\u2019s reaction to Gracia\u2019s post-match gift.\n\u201cI gave him a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale and he gave me one of his sangrias,\u201d Dowson said. \u201cThe sangria was that small. I thought he was a bit tight.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get lashed tonight in the working men\u2019s club with darts and pool, and then I\u2019ll be back in tomorrow.

        "content": "Pete Wild described it as a fairytale and that was no hyperbole from an Oldham fan who bought a ticket to watch this match with friends but ended up managing the League Two team to victory over Premier League hosts.\n\u201cMy mates have said they\u2019ll stand for the ticket now but we\u2019ll see,\u201d said the 33-year-old with the broadest of smiles. A wonderful story unfolded with a perfect sense of drama, as the underdogs fought back from a goal down thanks to strikes by Sam Surridge and Callum Lang either side of a penalty save by Daniel Iversen.\nTen days ago this seemed an outlandish scenario. Wild had made arrangements to travel by train to Craven Cottage with five fellow fans but then, following Frankie Bunn\u2019s dismissal as manager after a 6-0 defeat at Carlisle United on Boxing Day, he was asked to become the club\u2019s manager on a caretaker basis. He stepped up from the role of academy manager, to which he had been assigned in June, also on an interim basis.\nIt would have been a difficult time for anyone to get the job, let alone someone who was running Oldham under-16s last season and, by his own admission, had \u201conly been an academy manager for two minutes\u201d. The club has endured the most traumatic year in its recent history featuring discord, financial problems and relegation to League Two, a level to which they had not sunk since 1971. In his first two matches in charge Wild led Oldham to wins over Port Vale and Notts County but that could hardly be cited as evidence that victory over Premier League opponents was imminent.\nTo Wild\u2019s immense credit, and Fulham\u2019s ignominy, there was no chasm on the pitch between the team who spent over \u00a3100m on players after last summer\u2019s promotion to the Premier League and the one that has fended off winding-up orders and, in October, faced threats of a strike by players over unpaid wages.\nFrom the start here it was clear that Wild has instilled method and confidence. The 4,000 visiting fans had good cause to sing throughout the match. Fulham\u2019s frustrations were encapsulated by the moment in the 37th minute when Neeskens Kebano was booked for diving in the box.\nOldham\u2019s defence, marshalled by the 37-year-old Peter Clarke, had kept their hosts at bay with such poise that the only hints of a goal up until then were a couple of headers by Floyd Ayit\u00e9. Neither required Iversen to make a save. \u201cThe first half was boring from us,\u201d said Claudio Ranieri later. It was music to Oldham\u2019s ears.\nFulham might have thought they had restored order when Denis Odoi drove the ball into the net in the 52nd minute after an inadvertent back-header from Ayit\u00e9. But Oldham have grown accustomed to adversity and were not about to give up. Ranieri had made six changes to the lineup that started Fulham\u2019s last Premier League match but, in recognition of Oldham\u2019s defiance, he introduced more of his top players as the game advanced. The substitutions backfired.\nRyan Sessegnon\u2019s first involvement after his arrival in the 73rd minute resulted in him conceding a penalty after the prodigy tangled with the veteran Clarke. One of Wild\u2019s substitutes, Surridge, converted from the spot. After the game he returned to Bournemouth, from whom he had been on loan since the start of the season.\nRanieri cast on another high-calibre substitute, Aleksandar Mitrovic, just in time to take a penalty awarded to Fulham following a dubious tumble from Tom Cairney. Any debate about that was made redundant by Iversen\u2019s save but Oldham exacted retribution anyway and in glorious style.\nIn the 89th minute Gevaro Nepomuceno sent a cross to the back post and Callum Lang scored with a superb header. For Lang, too, this was a surreal turn of events given that on Friday he thought he would miss this match and return to Wigan, from whom he is on loan. \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cLast week it was touch and go whether I would be going back to Wigan and now I\u2019m enjoying one of the best feelings of my career, if not one of the greatest moments of my life.\u201d\nRanieri was left to fret about what this performance means for his team\u2019s chances of Premier League survival. He said he was let down by players who have been asking for game time since his arrival in November. \u201cYou have an opportunity to prove me wrong and you miss it,\u201d said the Italian. \u201cIf you lose and the players give you 100% passion and desire I can accept it but we didn\u2019t play with passion and I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d\nAs for Wild, he says he has no idea what this win means for his career. But as an Oldham fan he knows who he wants his team to get in the fourth round. \u201cManchester United away, because they ruined my childhood,\u201d he said, referring to United\u2019s last-gasp win in the 1994 FA Cup semi-final \u2013 Oldham\u2019s last major mark in the competition \u2013 until now.",

Six microphones were placed in a curve behind the frontline and a soldier near the frontline was given a button connected to a string galvanometer, inside which each microphone was connected to a thin wire that moved when that microphone picked up a sound. As each wire cast a shadow on to a moving piece of photographic film, a record was made of the sound picked up by each microphone.\nThe century old-technology means there is a photographic record of the guns at 11am on 11 November 1918. Modern technology has since allowed the artillery fire of the minute before to be recreated in a sound artefact at IWM London, where listeners can hear the gun\u2019s vibrations through a special wooden elbow board.\nField Music, who have a reputation for innovative and varied live performances, were commissioned by the museum to create a commemorative sound and light show.\nDavid Brewis said the sets had been inspired by the graphic record and sound artefact, which he described as \u201cthis tiny, incomplete fragment, not much more than a moment, but one which could be both the beginning and the ending of a huge story\u201d.\n\u201cWhat we have done is really try to capture the echoes of the first world war in all the time since,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have taken a lot of things, both visually and sonically, from the piece,\u201d he added, explaining the two shows would involve animation as well as songs \u2013 some funny.\n\u201cWe have looked at little stories, events, moments, or technological advances, which happened in the war, or immediately after, and drawn a line from there across the next 100 years.\u201d\nAs part of the project, the brothers researched the New Zealand-born surgeon Harold Gillies, who during the war pioneered facial cosmetic surgery and who went on to carry out one of the first gender realignment operations.\nThe duo were also inspired by a small Wisconsin company that developed a new material for dressing wounds and then adapted it for the first modern sanitary product. The company was Kimberly-Clark, and its product called Kotex.\n\u201cThe spaces we will be performing in are so incredible and so intense,\u201d said Brewis, \u201cso we have to be respectful to the gravitas of the stories those museums are telling.\u201d\n The IWM North performance is on 24 January from 9-11pm, and at IWM London on 31 January from 9-11pm. Tickets can be booked via iwm.org.uk",

Last financial year, the NT government granted just 292 of the 900 FOI requests it finalised, and partially granted another 298.\nIt refused 246 FOI requests, or 27%. Victoria refused 3.89% and Western Australia 3.2%. It is also significantly higher than the commonwealth\u2019s refusal rate of 17%, which is itself a record high. Data for other jurisdictions in 2017-18 is not yet available.\nThe year prior, the NT had by far the highest refusal rate (28%) of any jurisdiction. The next closest was Queensland at 20%. The commonwealth refused 10% of FOI requests in the same year.\nThe total volume of FOI requests received in the NT is low compared with the rest of the country, making the refusal rate more susceptible to change than larger jurisdictions. There can be legitimate reasons for refusing an FOI request, including that the documents are legally exempt or do not exist, or that the application itself is deficient.\nBut the NT\u2019s refusal rate has now been above 20% for four years running, and experts believe there are deeper problems inhibiting the release of information.\nKen Parish, an NT-based legal academic at Charles Darwin University, said there was no obvious reason for the high refusal rate, given the territory\u2019s FOI legislation is no more restrictive than other jurisdictions.\nParish believes the result may partly be a cultural problem within the NT public service. He also believes the NT\u2019s status as the last Australian jurisdiction to introduce FOI may also have played a role.\nParish said the territory had a huge public-sector workforce, relative to other states and territories. The workforce was also top-heavy, he said, with almost half the workforce being made up of managerial or administrative staff.\n\u201cI hypothesise that what we\u2019ve got therefore is a very large public service culture.\u201d He said the public service was dominated by managers who were \u201cvery much politicised because of the senior executive service and a large and still-growing set of ministerial advisers\u201d.\n\u201cIt may well be that the rate of non-response to FOI requests is in one sense a part of that,\u201d he said.\nThe territory\u2019s large public-sector workforce also ought to mean refusing FOI requests on practical grounds was less likely, he said.\nGuardian Australia approached the office of the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, for comment, but did not receive a response.\nThe Gunner government made numerous promises to improve transparency and accountability before taking office in 2016. It promised to set up an integrity commission, which it has done, reform political donations and disclose politicians\u2019 registrable interests.",

        "content": "Undercover officer with fake name denied two relationships but then changed story\nA police spy appears to have misled a public inquiry about sexual relationships he had with two women while he was undercover.\nThe undercover officer initially told the inquiry he had not had sexual relationships with the two women while using the fake name of James Straven.\nHe later admitted to having the relationships while he infiltrated animal rights groups between 1997 and 2002. The two women only discovered he had deceived them after he made this admission.\nA public inquiry, led by the retired judge Sir John Mitting, is examining the conduct of undercover officers who spied on more than 1,000 political groups since 1968. One of the issues it is due to look at is how the police spies frequently formed intimate relationships with women while concealing their real identities.\nAccording to the inquiry, Straven denied the existence of the two relationships in a signed statement in October 2017. At that time, he had for more than a year been attempting to persuade the inquiry to make a legal order keeping his identity secret.\nHowever, in April 2018 he admitted he had had intimate relationships with both women, according to the inquiry.\nThe women have now become part of the inquiry and are due to give evidence about how he deceived them.\nOne of the women, known as Sara as she has been granted anonymity by Mitting, has told the inquiry that Straven conducted a deceitful intimate relationship with her between late 1998 and March 2001.\nSara said: \u201cWhy should we be surprised that he hasn\u2019t been honest? Anything any undercover officer has to say is up for argument \u2013 they are trained liars and deceivers.\n\u201cApart from the confusion and deep emotional effects of these officers on the women targeted, what appals me is that these relationships appear to have been sanctioned at a higher level, which amounts to state abuse and institutionalised sexism. No concern at all for using women\u2019s lives, including the wives of the officers.\u201d\nThe second woman, known as Ellie, has told the inquiry that in 2001, Straven had initiated a sexual relationship with her that lasted about a year.\nStraven lost his attempt to keep his identity concealed as Mitting did not accept his denial about the sexual relationships.\nStraven said he \u201cintends to fully cooperate with the inquiry and will provide any evidence he is able to give to the inquiry and it does not seem appropriate that matters the inquiry is going to investigate should be ventilated in the media beforehand\u201d.\nThe inquiry was set up in 2014 by the then home secretary, Theresa May, after what she called \u201cserious failings\u201d in undercover policing had been exposed. The inquiry \u2013 which has been much delayed \u2013 is due to start hearing evidence in public in June.\nAn analysis by the Guardian shows that so far, 20 undercover officers deployed in political groups between the mid-1970s and 2010 are known to have had sexual relationships, some of them lasting years, while using fake identities. All but one are men. Some of the men had relationships with more than one woman during their undercover missions.\nPolice have paid compensation to at least 12 women who were deceived by undercover officers who spied on political groups.\nStraven was a member of the Metropolitan police\u2019s special demonstration squad (SDS), which infiltrated political groups between 1968 and 2008. He spied on the Animal Liberation Front and a group of London activists from Brixton and Croydon who opposed foxhunting.\nMitting\u2019s inquiry is also examining why Straven appears to have used a second false identity while undercover, without the authorisation of his SDS supervisors.\nAccording to the inquiry, this second identity was Kevin Crossland, a five-year-old boy who had died in a plane crash in the former Yugoslavia in 1966 when going on holiday with his family.\nUndercover officers routinely stole the identities of dead children but did so with the authority of their superiors.",

The YouGov poll of more than 25,000 people indicated a second referendum is backed by 75% of Labour voters.\nGardiner, interviewed on Sky News, said the quickest way of getting a people\u2019s vote was to have a general election, because legislating for a referendum would take far longer.\nAt an election, Labour \u201cwould set out what we would seek to negotiate in Europe to try and deliver,\u201d, he told presenter Sophy Ridge.\nGardiner said May had botched her EU negotiations because of her red lines. \u201cIf we as a new, incoming Labour government were to go to Europe without those red lines we know that we could get a different, better deal.\n\u201cAt that stage it makes sense to go to the country and say, \u2018here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate, this is the deal that we have managed to conclude because we don\u2019t have the same red lines as Theresa May.\u2019\n\u201cAnd it seems to me, at a personal level, what I would then say is that is the time when we would then say to people, \u2018now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude,\u2019\u201d he said.\nGardiner\u2019s comments come after the YouGov poll found Labour trail the Tories at 34% to 40% as it stands, with Labour\u2019s support falling to 26% if Labour MPs voted with the Tories to bring about Brexit.\nA Labour source said the party had made clear its priority was a good deal or a general election but without these, \u201call options\u201d remained on the table, including a campaign for a public vote.\nIn further signs of tensions over the People\u2019s Vote campaign, Emily Thornberry accused it of seeking to \u201cslap the Labour party around\u201d.\nThe shadow foreign secretary told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics: \u201cWhat I would like them to be particularly focusing on is taking the arguments as to why we should remain in the European Union to people who voted to leave and to try to change some hearts and minds, rather than using it \u2013 as some people I think do \u2013 as an opportunity to attack the Labour party and the leadership of the Labour party.\u201d\nA People\u2019s Vote spokesman said Thornberry was \u201cbadly mistaken\u201d in her views about the campaign, adding: \u201cWhat we are doing is highlighting the biggest poll on Brexit yet, which shows that Labour will suffer its worst electoral defeat since the 1930s if it continues promising to enable some sort of Brexit to go ahead.\n\u201cIn that situation, it won\u2019t be us slapping the leadership but millions of Labour voters who want the party to fight for the public services, rights and living standards that will otherwise be hammered by any kind of Brexit deal.\u201d",

Similarly I am sadly not surprised that he keeps a job in what has become a shambolic government. In any other government it would have been truly amazing that he was put in charge of transport, particularly given his spectacular failures as minister of justice.\nOwen Jones alludes to his record of \u201cblunders\u201d and \u201cdisaster\u201d but I think his virtual destruction of a gold star probation service in 2013/14 needs to be spelt out. People need reminding about it. He oversaw the transforming rehabilitation agenda that meant selling off a huge section of the probation service to private contractors. Again no concern was shown that some of these had little knowledge of what delivering probation services involves. The government has already had to bail out these private firms who were not able to make the profit they expected \u2013 crime does not and should not pay!\nFunny that Grayling has now chosen a \u201cno ship\u201d company to provide additional ferry services in the event of the desolation of a no-deal Brexit. Some of us who worked in probation likened the transforming rehabilitation project to the Titanic, all gloss and absolutely no substance. Many of us, including me, jumped ship before the doomed voyage into private justice began. We had already seen what privatisation had done and has continued to do to the prison service. As Dostoevsky said: \u201cThe degree of civilisation in a society can be judged by entering its prisons\u201d. Certainly, as Owen Jones says, there are signs here of \u201cnational and political decline\u201d. Many reports from HM Inspectorate of Probation have been scathing about the situation in the now fragmented probation provision. Grayling was warned that it wouldn\u2019t work and that it could pose a risk to public safety but he took no notice. He was no more knowledgeable about criminal justice matters than he is a \u201cspecialist in rail matters\u201d.\nIt appears that cabinet ministers can make catastrophic mistakes and still be given power to make more. This government\u2019s policies usually involve giving shed loads of money to private firms who are ill-equipped to deliver and end up costing more to the public purse and causing damage to the communities Tory MPs claim to serve.Jan ClareNottingham\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

He was released on his own recognisance \u2013 a promise to appear in court, which means there was no need to post bail \u2013 and paid a $25 (\u00a320) fine plus $91 costs on Friday.\nA spokesman for the footballer said the arrest came after he was left \u201cdisorientated\u201d by prescribed sleeping tablets that he took on a flight from Saudi Arabia following a one-day promotional business trip.\n\u201cDuring the flight Wayne took a prescribed amount of sleeping tablets mixed with some alcohol consumption and consequently was disorientated on arrival,\u201d his spokesperson said.\n\u201cHe was approached by police who arrested him on a minor misdemeanour charge. He received a statutory automatic fine and was released shortly afterwards at the airport.

About a quarter of the US government has been closed for more than two weeks and about 800,000 workers are without pay.\n\u201cI like acting,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great cabinet.\u201d\nHe did not elaborate on why acting officials give him more flexibility or say why that should be a good thing, but he spoke as critics continued to voice alarm over the departure of a succession of senior advisers who were seen as able to restrain his wilder impulses.\nSecretary of state Rex Tillerson, defense secretary Jim Mattis, national security adviser HR McMaster, attorney general Jeff Sessions and chief of staff John Kelly have all been forced out by Trump. United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley resigned. Mattis, Sessions, Haley and Kelly\u2019s replacements are all serving in an acting capacity.\nOn Saturday night, the Pentagon chief of staff \u2013 not a cabinet post \u2013 announced his resignation. Obama-era UN ambassador Samantha Power responded by tweeting: \u201cIt is [5 January] 2019: we have no Secretary of Defense & now no DoD chief of staff, no Attorney General & no evident guardrails in Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\u201cThe President is unhinged \u2013 even GOP zealots know it. Rs inside & outside the admin must stop enabling Trump & protect America.\u201d\nAdam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, told CNN on Sunday he agreed \u201cthat all of the adults are one by one being forced out of the room. Anyone who had the standing \u2026 to tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear, has been pushed aside.\u201d\nThere are 24 cabinet-level positions and six are now filled by individuals serving in an acting capacity, after the departure of members confirmed by the Senate. Other than the White House chief of staff and the vice-president, cabinet-level officials require such confirmation. Federal law allows presidents to temporarily fill vacancies by appointing acting department heads who are already employees there.\nTrump said last month he was in no hurry to name a new defense secretary, after Mattis quit. On Friday he reacted to reports that he was considering the Vietnam veteran and former Democratic senator and presidential candidate Jim Webb by praising the acting secretary, Patrick Shanahan.\n\u201cThe story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is a fine man, but I don\u2019t know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!\u201d\nShanahan is a former Boeing executive who has little experience of diplomacy or management of the military.\nElsewhere, David Bernhardt is acting secretary of the interior department, Matthew Whitaker is acting attorney general, Andrew Wheeler is acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency and Mick Mulvaney is the acting White House chief of staff. Jonathan Cohen is acting ambassador to the United Nations.\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, a Washington thinktank, in the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency there has been a 65% turnover rate among senior-level advisers.",

        "content": "Noise which saw diplomats complaining of headaches and nausea could be song of Indies short-tailed cricket\nThe US embassy in Havana more than halved its staff in 2017 when diplomats complained of headaches, nausea and other ailments after hearing penetrating noises in their homes and nearby hotels.\nThe mysterious wave of illness fuelled speculation that the staff had been targeted by an acoustic weapon. It was an explanation that appeared to gain weight when an audio recording of a persistent, high-pitched drone made by US personnel in Cuba was released to the Associated Press.\nBut a fresh analysis of the audio recording has revealed what scientists in the UK and the US now believe is the true source of the piercing din: it is the song of the Indies short-tailed cricket, known formally as Anurogryllus celerinictus.\n\u201cThe recording is definitively a cricket that belongs to the same group,\u201d said Fernando Montealegre-Zapata, a professor of sensory biology at the University of Lincoln. \u201cThe call of this Caribbean species is about 7 kHz, and is delivered at an unusually high rate, which gives humans the sensation of a continuous sharp trill.\u201d\nAs a child growing up in South America, Montealegre-Zapata recalls collecting crickets of a similar species and keeping them in cages in his room. One night he woke to a penetrating sharp sound. The culprit was one of the males calling out for mates. The offender was banned from the room but Montealegre-Zapata could still hear the cricket singing for females.\n\u201cI am not surprised that this call could disturb people who are not familiar with insect sounds,\u201d he said.\nThe identification of the sound source does not mean that an attack of some sort did not happen, but it casts doubt over the sound being responsible for the diplomats\u2019 health problems. The cause and nature of their illnesses remains unclear.\nThe spate of unexplained health problems among the US diplomats led doctors at the University of Pennsylvania to run tests on almost two dozen embassy staff. In March last year, the team concluded the diplomats had suffered concussion-like injuries, but other medical professionals have challenged the conclusions, claiming the doctors misinterpreted the test results.\nNot all of the affected diplomats reported unusual sounds when they fell ill, and descriptions of any noises differed from person to person. Some recalled grinding or cicada-like sounds, while others experienced buffeting like that caused by an open car window.\nIn the new study, Montealegre-Zapata and Alexander Stubbs at the University of California searched a scientific database for insect sounds that matched the Cuban recording. The call of the Indies short-tailed cricket turned out to be remarkably similar, they found, with acoustic pulses repeated at the same rate, and specific frequencies being louder than others.\nBut the cricket\u2019s mating call and the Cuban recording did not match up perfectly. The sound recorded in Havana had an uneven pulse structure which is not seen in calling insects.\nStubbs and Montealegre-Zapata realised that the discrepancy might be down to the environments in which the recordings were made. Scientists tend to record insect calls outside in the wild, while the diplomats complained of unpleasant sounds indoors. If the Cuban recording had been made in a room, the odd pulse structure might be explained by echoes off the walls, floor and ceiling.\nThe researchers tested the idea by playing the call of the Indies short-tailed cricket in a room through a single loudspeaker. Recordings from the room show that the sound gained the same uneven pulse structure seen in the Cuban recording. The two sounds matched even more closely.\nGerald Pollack, who studies how animals detect and discriminate sensory signals at McGill University in Montreal, said: \u201cThe paper shows how the cricket\u2019s song could, when echoes to be expected in an indoor setting are taken into account, produce sounds strikingly, and quantitatively, similar to that provided by the AP. I find this a completely plausible explanation.\u201d\nHe added that while he had no personal experience with the Indies short-tailed cricket, he had not heard of their calls ever having caused harm. \u201cSo far as I am aware,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept perhaps for an occasional sleepless night, no-one has suffered ill health as a result of cricket calls.\u201d",

I\u2019m so proud; they\u2019ve been brilliant for me the way they performed. I was proud of them in the two previous games but this takes it to a whole new level.\u201d\nOldham, who faced opponents who were 59 places ahead of them in the league pyramid, came from behind to defeat Fulham thanks to Callum Lang\u2019s late winner. \u201cIt means a lot to me and my family. We\u2019re all Oldham people,\u201d said the caretaker manager, Pete Wild. \u201cWe\u2019re from a small town overshadowed by big neighbours and I\u2019m so proud to give something back.\u201d\nSheffield United came unstuck after making 10 changes for the third-round tie, while Currie named the same team that drew with Boreham Wood on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cI don\u2019t really buy into all that resting, if they are tired, they can go to bed early,\u201d Currie added. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled with the result but I don\u2019t want to get too carried away. We will become the favourite when we host Dorchester next week in the FA Trophy so it\u2019s straight back down to earth.\u201d\nA seething Chris Wilder ripped into his players after defeat, accusing them of complacency. \u201cI\u2019ve just said to the boys: \u2018Don\u2019t go out through the main entrance, you don\u2019t deserve to go out of the main entrance. Try and find a door to sneak out of.\u2019 Because that\u2019s what the performance was. It was one of arrogance; it was off-plan, doing what they wanted to.\n\u201cThe support that our fans gave to the Barnet players was first-class and fully deserved, but they should have booed our own players louder. I knew Barnet would bring their A game to the table, we told the players they would be up for it and raise their game. I should imagine the Barnet players are getting back on the coach are possibly saying: \u2018How the hell are they third in the division?\u2019 And what I will say, well, we are third because none of those players that played today are going to force their way into the first team.\u201d\nThe Newport manager, Michael Flynn, added: \u201cIt\u2019s almost Roy of the Rovers stuff, I can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve beaten a Premier League club as a manager so it\u2019s one I\u2019ll never forget. I\u2019ll have a few drinks with the wife tonight. It\u2019s about being with the people who support you and are with you when times are bad as well, and my wife does that for me.\u201d",

Plus: Socceroos go down 1-0 to Jordan at Asian Cup\nGood morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 7 January. Welcome to the 2019 format \u2013 we\u2019ve made a few changes to how we deliver your news each day.\nDonald Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency over immigration to allow him to build a wall on America\u2019s southern border. As the government shutdown triggered by the president entered its 16th day, Trump threatened to take extraordinary action to bypass Congress, where Democrats are refusing to pass a spending bill that would give him $5.6bn to build his wall. New House speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the wall \u201can immorality\u201d and refused to fund Trump\u2019s signature election campaign pledge. Meanwhile, key Trump aides may be in legal jeopardy as Democrats give evidence to Robert Mueller.\nA young Saudi woman seeking asylum in Australia who is being held in a Bangkok hotel room fears she will be killed by her family if Thai authorities send her back to Saudi Arabia. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, said she was abducted on Sunday and had her passport confiscated by Saudi Arabian diplomatic staff on arrival at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport. Al-Qunun said she was trying to flee her family, who subjected her to physical and psychological abuse.\nJosh Frydenberg has condemned Queensland senator Fraser Anning for attending a rally involving far-right extremists and filming a video alongside its leaders, the convicted criminals Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson. On Sunday, Anning said he would be charging taxpayers for his return flights to Melbourne, describing his attendance at the rally as \u201cofficial business\u201d. The treasurer said: \u201cFraser Anning\u2019s appearance was unacceptable and he should not have participated in this divisive event.\u201d Frydenberg said it was up to the independent parliamentary entitlements authority as to whether it was an official parliamentary duty expense.\nTheresa May insists a crucial vote on her Brexit deal will go ahead amid growing speculation of a delay. The British prime minister says parliament might be given a greater role in deciding on the UK\u2019s ties with the European Union in future. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.\nMalaysia\u2019s King Sultan Muhammad V has stepped down, ending weeks of speculation and following rumours he married a former Miss Moscow in Russia. Sultan Muhammad V\u2019s decision marks the first time a king has abdicated in the Muslim-majority country since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo officials have postponed the announcement of the country\u2019s election results. The government has cut internet access across the central African country, which has a population of 80 million, to prevent speculation on social media over the winner.\nSaudi courts will notify women by text message when they get divorced, in a new regulation that took effect on Sunday. The measure approved by the justice ministry appears to be aimed at curbing cases of men secretly ending marriages without informing their wives.\nCzech MPs will vote on a radical new bankruptcy law this month in response to the country\u2019s growing personal debt crisis. One of the causes of the crisis is the inflating of unpaid accounts with fees and penalties, which became commonplace after a 2001 reform ushering in a system of private bailiffs.\nThe Democrats\u2019 control of the House of Representatives will make life harder for Trump, but how much influence will they have? \u201cDo not ever underestimate the influence of Wall Street Democrats, corporate Democrats and the Democrats\u2019 biggest funders,\u201d writes Robert Reich, former US labour secretary and campaigner against widening income inequality. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 moneyed interests resist firmer regulation of Wall Street. They are unlikely to want to repeal the Trump-Republican tax cut for big corporations and the wealthy. When it comes to impeaching Trump, some of the Democrat\u2019s biggest funders worry that such a move might rile markets. They are counselling the House Democratic leadership to be cautious even when it comes to smaller acts of defiance, such as subpoenaing Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u201d\nWill 2019 be the year of \u201cdigital detoxes\u201d, as people relearn the importance of switch-off times and aeroplane modes? Jamie Bartlett thinks so. \u201cPractically every parent I know is engaged in a strategic war of attrition with an addicted four-year-old over screens, tablets, iPads and smartphones,\u201d he writes. \u201cLast week, to a collective sigh of relief, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health told them to worry less. But on the same day as the Royal College published its research, another study found a link between high social media usage and depression among young people.\u201d\nThe Socceroos\u2019 Asian Cup title defence has got off to the worst possible start with a 1-0 defeat to Jordan in Al Ain that leaves Graham Arnold\u2019s side facing an uphill battle to qualify from a competitive Group B.\nHeading into the final day of play at the SCG, Australia can only hope to salvage a draw in the fourth Test against India, having been forced to follow on yesterday, when bad light and rain shortened play. The series is lost, and the home side will have to bat the whole day to deny India another victory. Follow our live blog from 9.15am AEDT.\n\u201cThis is a brief appreciation of a pool \u2013 and it is also a cautious tribute to that other kind of space,\u201d writes Ronnie Scott, who has been swimming at a famous-but-unnamed gym and pool for years. \u201cWhen B moved to our city from another state, I took her to the pool on a burning summer\u2019s day,\u201d Scott writes. \u201cWe climbed up on the bleachers. That night her husband called me and said, \u2018Did you take my wife cruising at the pool today?\u2019\n\u201cThis is one of the pool\u2019s uses, especially on the bleachers, which transform, depending on the crowd and time of day, between a place to lie down and soak up the sunshine and a place for men to gossip, hang out with their mates and put on performances that could be classed as cruising \u2013 but in the friendliest, least edgy, most straight-friendly possible way. It would be achievable \u2013 if improbable \u2013 to miss them totally. It would be improbable \u2013 but achievable \u2013 to take someone home for the day. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder about the difference between cruising and looking, and whether it\u2019s just a matter of who happens to be in the space.\u201d\nCoalition MPs and security experts are warning that delays in addressing fuel stockpiles mean Australia would be \u201cdangerously exposed\u201d if a major geopolitical upheaval disrupts export supply routes, the Australian reports.

The girl\u2019s mother, LaPorsha Washington, who was driving the car and was shot in the arm, expressed confidence the killer would be found and gratitude for the outpouring of public help.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find him no matter what corner we have to turn, no matter what rock we have to look under,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find you, man.\u201d\nWashington and her four daughters were driving about 15 miles east of downtown Houston at about 6.50am last Sunday when they were attacked for no apparent reason. Jazmine, who loved music and had ambitions of becoming a teacher, was shot in the head and died at the scene.\nSome activists and the family, who are black, believed the unprovoked nature of the crime in a part of Harris county known for racial tensions pointed to the possibility of a racially motivated attack. The sheriff\u2019s office released a sketch of a suspect, a white man in his 30s or 40s.\n\u201cWe do believe that it was racially motivated in part because our nation at this moment is a highly racially charged society,\u201d S Lee Merritt, the family\u2019s attorney, told reporters last week.\nBut Black, the suspect, is African American and the sheriff\u2019s office said the shooting appears to be a case of mistaken identity.\n\u201cAt this time,\u201d it said, \u201cinvestigators do not believe Jazmine\u2019s family was the intended target of the shooting.\u201d\nOn Twitter, Merritt wrote: \u201cIt is difficult to understand how at least four independent witnesses mistook two black male suspects for one older white suspect. However, it is imaginable that witnesses confused a fleeing bystander for the actual shooter.\u201d\nEd Gonzalez, the sheriff, said in a statement: \u201cOur work is not finished, but I believe the people of Harris county can take comfort in knowing we have made great progress.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Gonzalez said authorities were still investigating and added: \u201cIt does not appear it was related to race.\u201d The sheriff said authorities had identified two suspects and both were African American. He would not say if the second suspect was in custody.\nGonzalez said a person in a red truck whom authorities had been seeking appears to have just been a witness.\nAmid national attention on the case, a $100,000 reward for finding the killer was offered and a GoFundMe page has raised more than $76,000 for the family\u2019s expenses. Jazmine\u2019s funeral is scheduled for Tuesday.",

        "content": "Downing Street insists new compromises can be won from Europe to ensure passage of PM\u2019s plan\nTheresa May is preparing to make another desperate plea to EU leaders to offer a concession on the Irish backstop as she attempts to win over Brexiters who have vowed to vote down the government\u2019s deal.\nThe prime minister on Sunday promised to hold the meaningful vote in parliament in the week beginning 14 January despite growing opposition from Conservative backbenchers and the Democratic Unionist party, whose votes are required to push the deal through parliament.\nAs MPs prepare to return to Westminster with the crucial Commons vote looming on the withdrawal agreement, Downing Street insisted that new compromises could still be won from Europe that would ensure the safe passage of May\u2019s plan.\nThe hope of new developments came as opposition to the prime minister\u2019s deal hardened. The hurdles facing May include:\n Brexiters say the government faces a disaster if it fails to ditch the current deal, with DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds describing the Irish backstop as \u201ctoxic\u201d.\n EU sources say talks to be held in Dublin on Tuesday between Leo Varadkar and Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, will not seek to reopen negotiations over the 585-page withdrawal agreement.\n Senior MPs including Yvette Cooper and Nicky Morgan are launching a parliamentary campaign to rewrite government legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.\n Chris Patten, the former Conservative Party chairman, called for a second referendum on the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU.\n More than 200 MPs have signed a letter calling for Theresa May to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Tory ex-minister Dame Caroline Spelman, who organised the letter with Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey, said the group had been invited to see the prime minister on Tuesday.\nIn an interview on Sunday, May said the vote, which was due to be held last month and postponed, would go ahead next week, as she sought further clarification from the EU to address MPs\u2019 concerns.\nShe also said she would look at giving parliament a greater say in how the UK\u2019s future relationship would be negotiated, but refused to say exactly what that might be.\nAsked if there had been any changes she could offer to backbenchers who were expected to vote down her deal, she told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWhat we will be setting out over the next few days are assurances in three areas: first are measures specific to Northern Ireland; the second is a greater role for parliament as we take these negotiations forward into the next stage for our future relationship; and third \u2013 and we are still working on this \u2013 is further assurances from the European Union to address the issues that have been raised.\u201d\nWhitehall sources insisted that a compromise could still be found with the EU and that further planned announcements will be made this week that would win over MPs opposed to the deal. \u201cWe will be working flat out. There will be further contacts with the EU leaders. The issue of the backstop is not yet over,\u201d the source said.\nIn the interview, May repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether she would keep putting the deal back to MPs if it got rejected, instead saying: \u201cIf the deal is not voted on, this vote that is coming up, then actually we are going to be in uncharted territory. I don\u2019t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we will see in parliament.\u201d\nMark Francois, the vice-chair of the hardline-Brexit European Research Group, said May\u2019s intervention on Marr showed that the government and the EU have little to offer their critics.\n\u201cAs the prime minister herself once said, nothing has changed. No Conservative backbencher that I am aware of who was declared as against the deal has publicly recanted.\n\u201cThe PM made very clear on Marr that the vote will go ahead at this time and that is good, because if they were to pull it a second time, as well as not being in power they would effectively no longer be in office.\u201d\nConservative sources claim there are between 55 and 71 MPs who plan to vote against the deal.\nThe DUP, whose 10 MPs are required by May to force through the deal, remain opposed. Dodds said the government must stand firm and set out a \u201cresolute red line\u201d to Brussels. \u201cThe coming days will show if this government is made of the right stuff,\u201d he said.\nThe government is also facing a serious challenge from a cross-party group of MPs seeking to block it from implementing no-deal measures without the explicit consent of parliament.\nAmendments tabled by Labour former cabinet minister Cooper and former Tory education secretary Morgan would restrict the government\u2019s freedom to make Brexit-related tax changes without parliamentary safeguards.\nThe measure also has the support of Tories Sir Oliver Letwin, Nick Boles and Sarah Wollaston.\nThe UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. May agreed her deal on the terms of the UK\u2019s divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU but it needs to pass a vote by MPs. The Commons vote had been scheduled to take place in December but May called it off after it became clear that not enough MPs would back her deal.\nMaas will fly to Dublin on Tuesday for Brexit talks with Varadkar, as they seek to find a fix to help get a withdrawal agreement ratified.\nAn informed EU source said Brexiters should not get their hopes up of a reopening of negotiations. The \u201cfix\u201d would be further details in the political declaration on the future relationship, and not the 585-page withdrawal agreement. \u201cThat is locked,\u201d said the source.\n A Downing Street spokeswoman said: \u201cWhat we are doing is focusing on getting this vote through the House of Commons and getting those extra assurances required for MPs to support this deal that delivers on the referendum result \u2013 taking back control of our money, laws and borders while protecting jobs in the UK.\u201d",

Whereas the Moon is airless and the Earth has a full atmosphere, Mars has a tenuous atmosphere. Whereas the Moon is arid and Earth boasts an abundance of water, Mars shows evidence that water once flowed there but no longer. During 2019, Mars will travel behind the Sun from our perspective.

        "content": "Minutes after the final whistle had been blown Barnet\u2019s players slid on their knees in unison towards 966 delirious visiting supporters, looking down on their heroes from the top tier of the Bramall Lane end. It was a real wrench for Darren Currie, the caretaker manager taking charge of Barnet for the third time and the nephew of the Sheffield United director, Tony, to leave the pitch, and the scenes of jubilation behind. When he and his players, after wildly swinging amber scarves thrown from above in celebration, eventually did, hundreds of home supporters yet to funnel out of the stadium joined Barnet fans in applauding an assured performance by the non-league side.\nInside the dressing room, the party had started. Barnet players chucked a bucket of water over their manager, who arrived for his press conference with his shirt saturated. \u201cThis is all new, I was only coaching last week,\u201d Currie muttered as he sat down, before later tracking down his uncle in a nearby suite. It was Shaquile Coulthirst, the former Tottenham youngster, who slammed home the only goal of the game from the penalty spot as Barnet, 15th in the fifth tier, pulled off an upset to progress to the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2008.\nSo composed and courageous was Barnet\u2019s display it was difficult to know which team are in the National League and which are third in the Championship and fighting for promotion to the Premier League. United, booed off at the final whistle, were unconvincing at best. Even the second-half introduction of the captain Billy Sharp, one of 10 players rested here by the manager, Chris Wilder, could not force a replay.\nThis was always going to be a family affair. Currie was put in caretaker charge of Barnet following the sudden departure of John Still, who walked away from football management after 42 years last month. Currie\u2019s father, Paul, is the brother of the former England midfielder, Tony, who grew up in Hendon, a few miles from Underhill, Barnet\u2019s previous home. The latter is considered a legend in this half of the city and here the rookie manager found himself pacing the technical area in front of the packed Tony Currie Stand, renamed after his uncle \u2013 voted the Blades\u2019 best ever player five years ago and still a director at the club \u2013 in the summer.\nIf things had worked out differently during a trial as a teenager, Currie could have counted United among his former clubs but, instead, he played for Barnet and Wycombe, among others.\nCurrie told his players to play with no fear and they certainly followed his orders, flying out of the blocks with Coulthirst having a strike ruled out for offside inside six minutes after a slick interchange. Jack Taylor, playing as a No 10, was influential for Barnet and it was his cute one-two with Coulthirst that provided another chance for the visitors, only for Richard Stearman to intervene with a superb sliding challenge.\nStearman\u2019s timing was not so clever second time around, with Ephron Mason-Clark hauled down by the defender in the box following brilliant hold-up play by Coulthirst after collecting a ball in the left channel. Coulthirst immediately ran to scoop up the ball and hammered his penalty beyond Simon Moore, the United goalkeeper, who could get only a weak left hand to his effort. Barnet had established a deserved lead but did not relent, with Taylor and Craig Robson both trying their luck from distance. As the visiting supporters began singing about a trip to Wembley and beckoning Currie to wave back at them, the hosts struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances, with Paul Coutts\u2019 ambitious volley about as good as it got.\nBarnet, effective on the counterattack, would have doubled their lead through the lively Coulthirst after more good work by Mason-Clark on the byline but for a last-ditch intervention from Marvin Johnson. \u201cI think we have been quite fortunate that it was not two or three,\u201d a fuming Wilder said. \u201cThey got everything right and we got everything wrong.\u201d\nAt full time the home supporters acknowledged Barnet\u2019s efforts. It was a classy touch and Mason-Clark and Coulthirst proved such a nuisance that, when they were taken off, swaths of home fans applauded them. By the time Kieron Freeman dragged wide after the interval, Wilder had seen enough and summoned Mark Duffy, then Sharp, who last week scored his 220th league goal. Then came Chris Basham. But Barnet held on through a nerve-jangling final couple of minutes, with Mark Cousins tipping Leon Clarke\u2019s header on to the bar.\nAs the final whistle sounded, an inevitable chorus of \u201cWe\u2019re going to Wembley\u201d filled the stadium but equally predictable was the clamour for Currie to be given the job on a full-time basis, after hatching a historic upset in only his third match in management; Still, his predecessor, walked away from the game last month after managing more than 2,000.\nFor Currie, whose team face Dorchester on Saturday, few are likely to be as memorable as this.",

The 26-year-old almost dragged the Socceroos back into the clash with two second-half chances but he was far from alone in spurning things as Australia saw a string of good openings go begging.\nIn a match they dominated, with close to 80% possession, there was also some complaint to be had over the failure to award a penalty for a handball late in the first half as well as a series of injuries that have dented the quality available to coach Graham Arnold.\nMuch of those issues though gloss over a tactically disciplined showing from a Jordanian side that picked up just their fifth Asian Cup win \u2013 and celebrated as if they\u2019d won the tournament. In the end Australia simply couldn\u2019t break down opponents who were content to drop back as soon as they lost possession and play on the counter.\nAustralia\u2019s insistence in the first half of dropping one of the central midfielders \u2013 either Mark Milligan or Massimo Luongo \u2013 to form a back three was designed to push the wider players higher up the pitch but with Jordan harrying to close down the space it only saw the Socceroos continually surrounded.\nIn those moments the surety of touch, speed of movement and precision of pass required to find the space they needed was an aspect that let the Socceroos down and one that will need to improve before facing a Palestinian side in four days that are likely to play in a similar manner.\nThe final group opponent, Syria, are also likely to cede space to Australia knowing they then place pressure on the title holders to find solutions in those tight areas. Captain Milligan noted the team failed to do that effectively against Jordan.\n\u201cWe started a little slow and were na\u00efve in our ball movement early on and when these sorts of teams come with a plan, after having got a goal from a corner, it\u2019s always going to be difficult to break them down and that\u2019s when we really need to remain patient and wait for those moments to create good opportunities.\u201d\nThe loss is far from terminal in an expanded tournament where four of the best third-placed finishers across the six groups progress to the knockout stage but equally the margin for error is now fine.\nIt was the second time in three editions that the defending champions lost their opening match in the subsequent tournament, but what results have already shown \u2013 with India thumping Thailand and Bahrain holding the host nation to a 1-1 draw \u2013 is that the gap between those nations at the top and bottom of the Asian pyramid is narrowing.\nA Palestinian side with plenty to play for and comprised of players from a diaspora that stretches from Argentina and Chile, to Slovenia and North Carolina are sure to provide just as stern a test as Jordan did.\nFail that and the Socceroos will be back home to their prawns and BBQs to show that Sutton knows as little about Australian cuisine as he does Asian football.",

A low of just 867 shops was reached in 2016, but 2017 marked a tiny turnaround: then, the total number in the UK and Ireland increased by just one, to reach 868. At the time, the BA predicted that booksellers\u2019 fortunes were reversing. Now, its latest membership numbers confirm it: in 2018, the number of independents rose by 15 to 883. New stores range from Category Is Books in Glasgow \u2013 the second LGBTQ-dedicated bookshop in the UK \u2013 to the gloriously named Stripey Badger Bookshop in the Yorkshire Dales, and Lost in Books in Cornwall.\n\u201cIndependent bookshops are important because we\u2019re a refuge, and we\u2019re dead against everything becoming the same,\u201d says Daniel Ross from Storysmith, which he opened with his wife Emily in south Bristol in October. \u201cWe decided to open because we believe in bookselling as an essential function of a community, and real bookshops that inspire a lifelong love of reading.\u201d\nHe said the store had received \u201can incredibly warm welcome\u201d from locals, who had no independent bookshops in the area before: \u201cSo many people have come in and told us that it\u2019s exactly what the area needed. They all put their money where their mouths were in the run-up to Christmas and we had a very encouraging month of sales, better than we\u2019d been anticipating.\u201d Storysmith is not alone; in a separate BA survey, 63.5% of booksellers reported that customer numbers rose this Christmas compared with 2017.\nLast summer, Sarah Brook and her husband Peter left behind corporate jobs to open BrOOK\u2019s, a fully licensed bookshop in Pinner, Middlesex, after finding inspiration in a \u201cchampagne book bar\u201d they came across on an American road trip. Like Daniel, Sarah is feeling positive. \u201cIt has been very successful so far. The local community loves having a bookshop and Christmas saw huge gift sales. It\u2019s an inclusive environment and lots of people come and have a drink on their own and browse the books,\u201d she says. \u201cIndies are important because they choose their own stock which can adapt to the local community. They offer a personal service and treat each customer as an individual.\u201d\nAmanda Davidge of Lost in Books, opened last summer, agrees. \u201cI think there is a definite desire by locals to support local businesses as a reaction to the big online suppliers,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to work hard to make sure we can now keep the momentum going \u2026 I think it is important to keep small town communities alive by providing shops that locals want and also a hub for people to meet and to encourage reading.\u201d\nMany of the UK\u2019s newest independents are completely new to the trade, drawn to bookselling because they see the need in areas without a bookshop. Sarah Brook, previously an HR director, says it has always been her dream: \u201cWhen we opened, a friend of mine said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve actually gone and done it!\u2019\u201d\nElaine Sperber, who opened The Bookmark in Stockbridge High Street in Hampshire in April 2017, has lived in the area for 14 years \u201cand was amazed that there wasn\u2019t, and never had been, a bookshop in this lovely town\u201d. Previously a television producer, she\u2019d hoped to one day run a bookshop for a long time: \u201cSince we\u2019ve been there, so many customers from near and far have said how happy they are to have a small, curated, independent place where they can chat, browse and buy.\u201d\nThe new independents are original and innovative: at Vinyl Fiction in Manchester, Sarah Pregnall runs a spoken word event each month where writers can share their work and collaborate; at Storysmith, Ross goes an extra mile to encourage reading in his community.\n\u201cJust a few weeks ago, we were approached by a local primary school who\u2019d won a grant to restock the books in their classrooms, so we made a big deal of it \u2013 we got the kids into the shop, made them all hot chocolate, let them pick the books they wanted and then we delivered them the following week. It was chaos, but everyone loved it,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of them had never been in a bookshop before, and now we know they\u2019ve started their reading journey in a really positive way.\u201d\nWith other new stores including Max Minerva\u2019s Marvellous Books in Bristol, The Snug Bookshop in Bridgwater, Somerset and Top Hat and Tales in Faversham, Kent, Meryl Halls, managing director of the BA, said it was \u201cextremely encouraging to see independent bookshops succeeding in 2018, demonstrating the creativity and entrepreneurship of booksellers in the face of difficult challenges\u201d.\nBut Halls is clear that booksellers were still \u201cfacing an increasingly challenging landscape across the UK and Ireland\u201d. Challenges she cites include unequal business rates burdening physical bookshops \u2013 last year, the BA complained to the Treasury that Waterstones in Bedford pays 16 times more in business rates per square foot than the nearby Amazon distribution centre \u2013 as well as \u201cunfair\u201d competition from online retailers, and uncertainty caused by Brexit. She called on the government to \u201ctake the steps needed to protect the future of bookshops and their high streets, considering the concerns of retailers and booksellers so they can both flourish\u201d.",

As Fern was photographed, instead of looking away demurely, the Fiji Water Girl stared directly down the lens with an arched eyebrow and a half-smile, daring the camera to consider her a less worthy subject than the actor in front of her.\nShe did the same, again and again throughout the evening, with an unerring sense of where the camera is and her best angles.\nThere are two kinds of people in the world: the ones who desperately tries to shine and the ones who shine bright like a diamond. #GoldenGlobes #fijiwatergirl pic.twitter.com/E67OeuBqcr\nIt did not take long for a parody Twitter account to start, with someone tweeting on behalf of Fiji Water Girl.\nPlease meet my cousins: Moet & Chandon Guy.

But the evergreen brightness of the ferns resists the dreariness, evoking all the things the season lacks: lushness, fecundity, abundance. The glossy green of their fronds appears almost faintly unnatural, like it might have been the product of some diabolical magic. Where other plants fail, the ferns thrive.\nHart\u2019s tongue ferns are named for their distinctive undivided fronds, which seem to be gesturing at the air. You get the sense that if these tongues could talk, it would be in a primordial language. They sprout in and around the crater left behind by some crumbled ruins that are well on the way to being re-digested by nature, creating a scene that is part post-industrial Yorkshire, part Cretaceous jungle.\nThe ferns appear to be leeching life from the remains, and indeed they might be. Asplenium scolopendrium prefers a neutral to alkaline substrate and around here I have usually only seen it lolling from cracks in walls, rooted in lime mortar, rather than growing from the ground. Have construction materials used in the old building created localised conditions for the ferns to thrive?\n\n The ghyll is one of those places most people pass through on the main road without a second thought, unless they have use for the sprawling scrapyard or the recycling site. But it is more than just a place for unwanted human detritus. Hunt around below the eyeline of the world and you find treasures.\nNext to the ferns, a curtain of water tumbles over an old industrial waterfall in a way that is positively picturesque. I am familiar enough with the spot to know that when May finally arrives, these surroundings will become a sun-dappled glade densely carpeted with the white flowers of wild garlic. These sunken days will, of course, pass.",

        "content": "Actor due in courtroom to be arraigned on felony charges for an alleged sexual assault against a busboy at a restaurant in 2016\nThe tiny, fish-hook shaped island of Nantucket feels like a place separated from America by place and time. There are no traffic lights. You won\u2019t find a McDonalds, CVS or any other chain store ubiquitous across the US. In its quiet and partially cobblestoned downtown, some leave their cars running while they go into shops. In winter, the silence is only broken by church bells and the sound of a foghorn.\nIn the 1800s the island was the centre of the whaling industry but it has left its gritty past behind. It now attracts the richest of the rich, among them scions of business, owners of sports teams and faces familiar from TV: former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Tommy Hilfiger, Chris Matthews, John Kerry, Charles Schwab and Ben Stiller come here, among many others. Among those who have everything and can go anywhere, many choose to live \u2013 or at least summer \u2013 here.\nThe actor Kevin Spacey visited the island in recent years. On Monday, he is due in the island\u2019s lone courtroom to be arraigned on felony charges for an alleged sexual assault against a busboy at a restaurant in 2016. If convicted, the actor could face five years in prison. He would also have to register as a sex offender.\nThe saga has brought the #MeToo movement, and all the attention it generates, to an island where many go to get out of the spotlight.\n\u201cExtremely wealthy people or famous people or high-level politicians are attracted to Nantucket for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Bruce Percelay, publisher of Nantucket Magazine and the chairman and founder of the Mount Vernon Company, a New England real estate firm. \u201cBut one of them is that people don\u2019t care. If a celebrity comes to Nantucket and is hoping to be fawned over, they will be very disappointed. This is not the kind of place where people go to genuflect over sightings of the rich and famous. We leave that kind of behaviour to the Hamptons.\u201d\nThere appears to be truth to this. On Friday evening Bill Belichick \u2013 coach of the New England Patriots football team, practically a deity to many in Massachusetts, particularly at playoff time \u2013 was having a quiet dinner in the corner of a dimly lit restaurant where this writer was enjoying a beer. Nobody appeared to be paying him much attention, save for perhaps this writer, who couldn\u2019t help but steal glances at the man with five Super Bowl rings.\n\u201cEnjoy your evening coach,\u201d a hostess said casually as Belichick walked out into the cold winter night. \u201cGood luck next Sunday!\u201d\n\u201cYou could be sitting on a bench on Main Street next to a billionaire and you wouldn\u2019t know it because everybody is just casual and in their happy place,\u201d said Jeneane Life, owner of the Carlisle Inn. \u201cNantucket just gets in your blood. It\u2019s just a peaceful, serene, beautiful place.\u201d\nOn Nantucket, Percelay said, the rich and famous \u201ccan be themselves. That is something increasingly difficult to find.\n\u201cYou can pick up the phone book and find the names of Fortune 100 CEOs and their home phone numbers.\u201d\nFor those who want to make a home here, the entry barrier is set forbiddingly high. According to the Inquirer and Mirror, the island\u2019s weekly newspaper, the median home price on the island last year was $1.8m. The average price sat at $2.7m.\n\u201cWe like to jokingly say that this is where the millionaires have to mow the lawns for the billionaires,\u201d said Renee Ceely, executive director of the Nantucket Housing Authority. \u201cBecause if you do own real estate, more than likely it\u2019s worth more than a million dollars.\u201d\nEven visiting the island is out of reach for many: during the summer, rooms at inns run to many hundreds of dollars a night. There is one hostel, but visitors won\u2019t find any motels or popular chain hotels.\nThe exclusivity of Nantucket is enhanced by its seclusion, 30 miles off the Massachusetts coast. The only way on or off is by ferry or plane, though both of those options can be delayed by poor weather.\nThe island has about 10,000 year-round residents, but that number can go up more than five-fold in the summer. With most of the island zoned as conservation land and unavailable for development, land and housing stocks are limited. That means that finding housing for the workers who make the island tick \u2013 school teachers, postal workers, cops, restaurant and hotel staff \u2013 presents significant challenges.\nCeely, the Nantucket Housing Authority director, calls it a \u201ccritical problem\u201d and is working on creative solutions. On land deeded to the housing authority by the town, a small development of homes priced between $300,000 and $500,000 was recently built. A lottery chose prospective buyers who made less than 50% of Nantucket\u2019s median income.\n\u201cAffordable housing affects everyone, even the wealthy,\u201d Ceely said. \u201cThey get their meals, who takes care of them behind the register at the supermarket, who\u2019s cleaning the floors at the hospital? Who\u2019s your nurse?\u201d\nOn such an island, where invisibility and seclusion are main draws, the attention brought by the Spacey case is unwelcome, a breach of presumed safety and serenity.\nSpacey was an outsider, just visiting, when the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred. His accuser, however, is from a family with Nantucket ties. He is the son of Heather Unruh, a former Boston news anchor and a fixture on the island. In October 2017, as the #MeToo movement was born with sexual abuse allegations surfacing against film producer Harvey Weinstein, Unruh used Twitter.\n\u201cThe #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me \u2013 #truth time,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.\u201d\nDays later, actor Anthony Rapp came forward with allegations against Spacey, saying that when he was a 14-year-old child actor in New York, a 26-year-old Spacey tried to force himself on him. Spacey said he did not remember the alleged incident, but apologised for \u201cdeeply inappropriate drunken behaviour\u201d.\nIn November that year, Unruh held a press conference where she said her then 18-year-old son had been star-struck when Spacey showed up at the Club Car restaurant, where he worked. She alleged the actor bought her son alcohol and later stuck his hands in his pants, grabbing his genitals. She said her son fled the restaurant when Spacey excused himself to go to the bathroom.\nSpacey will plead not guilty. But to Percelay, the alleged incident was a violation of what Nantucket is about.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a presumed safeness to this island unlike many places,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect violations like the one that was [allegedly] perpetrated by Kevin Spacey. It just doesn\u2019t happen on Nantucket.\n\u201cThis type of celebrity just doesn\u2019t fit the ethos of Nantucket.\u201d",

Slack-Tide, Elanor Dymott\u2019s slim, lapidary third novel, seems at first a familiar tale. A novelist, Elizabeth, in her early 40s, has had a late-stage miscarriage. Her marriage crumbles in the wake of the tragedy. She is set up on a blind date with an American architect, Robert, who\u2019s 12 years older than her and \u201chad been let go by his wife\u201d. Elizabeth wants to try for another child and Robert, with his \u201csharp mind\u201d and \u201ca past played out in university campuses\u201d, seems like promising father material.\nWe know from the start that things don\u2019t work out for the couple. At the end of the prologue, we read \u201cby midsummer the thing between us was finished, and it was as if a storm had torn the roof from over me\u201d. Dymott knows just how much to reveal and conceal at each stage \u2013 the narrative is all conveyed in a wistful, backward-looking past tense. Given that we know how things work out, it\u2019s the why that keeps us reading; the shifting, inconclusive answers to that question make this a far stranger and more compelling novel than it might initially seem. This is also a book with an intense awareness of the material of everyday life: Dymott demonstrates beautifully how close attention paid to the description of the seemingly incidental objects that surround a character can bring them to life in a vivid and memorable way.\nGeorge Eliot said that the last thing we know in life is our effect on other people. While the unreliable narrator who sets out actively to pull the wool over the reader\u2019s eyes has become a hackneyed literary trope, the narrator whose unreliability means the truth is hidden even from herself is a more interesting proposition. We can see from the start the problems with Robert, but Elizabeth allows herself to be wooed \u2013 \u201ca part of me that\u2019s died was reminded of being alive\u201d, she tells a friend. The novel plays out in a series of vignettes, each of which ends with some new revelation of Robert\u2019s ghastliness, and yet Elizabeth remains convinced of her love for him. Eventually, she leaves him almost despite herself, and yet we question her commitment to the separation from the moment it occurs.\nRobert\u2019s creepiness is revealed in small acts, each seemingly innocuous. He is hugely wealthy and maintains uncomfortably close relations with his ex-wife, who\u2019s even richer; he bombards Elizabeth with expensive presents \u2013 perfume, bracelets, scarves \u2013 each a gesture of ownership; every seeming solicitude is understood by the reader to be an act of control. Robert appears to be the perfect new man \u2013 full of romantic gestures, a seemingly generous lover, a wonderful father to his teenage son. In fact, we come to recognise that he\u2019s selfish and predatory, and that Slack-Tide is a fierce and often very funny send-up of a generation of men who think they can have their cake and eat it.\n Slack-Tide by Elanor Dymott is published by Vintage (\u00a312.99).

        "content": "An estimated 10,000 were killed just weeks ago, and locals fear native stocks could be all but wiped out this time\nHundreds of thousands of fish have been killed along a stretch of the Lower Darling River in New South Wales in a second major incident which has led some experts to fear whole populations of local native fish have been wiped out.\nResidents near the Menindee Lakes are reporting what is the second major fish kill along a 20km stretch of water near Weir 32.\nAn incident before Christmas saw an estimated 10,000 fish die.\n Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLocals have been posting photos of dying fish washed up along the shores of the lakes which are about 100km east of Broken Hill.\nAnd local fish experts are saying that it could all but wipe out the populations of Murray cod and other native fish, raising serious questions about the way WaterNSW is managing the lakes system.\nTwo years ago the lakes were almost full. But WaterNSW has been releasing water and allowing extraction upstream for irrigation at a rate that has left the lakes almost completely dry.\nAccording to the WaterNSW website, there is just 2.5% of water remaining in the lakes.\nRod McKenzie, a fishing journalist and angler, who runs tours of the Murray-Darling, said he feared the kill would spell the end of a once great fishery.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute tragedy. This is a world-scale fish kill, but the catastrophe has been so well orchestrated and there is so much money involved you won\u2019t get to the bottom of it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf it were native animals like koalas and platypuses and they were lying by the side of the road, people would be up in arms,\u201d he said.\nJust before Christmas about 10,000 fish were estimated to have died in mass death incident in a 40km stretch a little further upstream.\nInvestigations by the Department of Primary Industries confirmed that Murray cod, golden and silver perch and bony bream had died in that event.\nDPI said it had visited the Menindee Lakes on Monday and \u201cconfirmed had been a major fish kill event in the Darling river at Menindee affecting hundreds of thousands of fish, including golden perch, Murray cod, and Bony Herring\u201d.\nDPI senior fisheries manager, Anthony Townsend, said the department would use the incident to learn more about our native fish and improve management.\nHe said the incident seemed to have resulted from a sudden drop in temperature which may have disrupted an existing algal bloom, killing it and leading to a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the river water. This would have exacerbated poor water quality for already stressed fish.\nAt the time of the first incident WaterNSW and the NSW Department of Primary Industry blamed the drought.\n\u201cThe ongoing drought conditions across western New South Wales have resulted in fish kills,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\nThe DPI\u2019s director of aquatic environment, Sarah Fairfull, said the prolonged dry period resulted in poor water quality along much of the Darling River and in other valleys.\nWaterNSW said at the time it was continuing to monitor water quality throughout the dams and river systems.\nThe latest incident will again raise questions about the NSW government\u2019s stewardship of the Murray-Darling River system, which has been under intense scrutiny since the ABC Four Corners program aired allegations of water theft by irrigators and a close relationship between senior bureaucrats and major water users.\nSince the 1960s, the original Menindee Lakes have been significantly altered to serve as a major storage for water for the Murray-Darling Basin as well as the water supply for Broken Hill. The lakes are also a major fish breeding area for native fish, and critical to maintaining stocks of fish throughout the river system.\nHowever, the NSW government has proposed shrinking the lakes and altering the way it manages the water storage, in order to reduce evaporation. It is currently building a $500m pipeline from the Murray to Broken Hill in order to provide the inland city with an alternative water supply.\nBut the plan is highly controversial because it will mean the government has less reason to keep the lakes full and will likely see the Lower Darling run dry more often.\nLocal graziers and the towns of Wilcannia and Pooncarie are up in arms about the state of the river, accusing the NSW government of sacrificing their 500km stretch of the Darling in order to benefit upstream cotton growers.\nThey say the current crisis is due to Water NSW\u2019s decision to run the lakes dry despite forecasts of drought.\nLocal grazier Julie McClure said there was virtually no water flowing under the bridge at Tilpa where she lives.\n\u201cOne neighbour is drawing water for stock and homestead use from a green stagnant pool. When she showers, she takes a bucket of rainwater to rinse off after using the river water,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt smells like a fish market. There should be some rules around emergency water management.\u201d\nThe new plan for Menindee Lakes is currently before the Murray Darling Basin Authority as part of a suite of projects that the states are proposing as an alternative to buying water for the environment from farmers. The idea is that the projects will deliver equivalent environmental outcomes. The Menindee Lakes project has received a very poor assessment by the authority\u2019s experts.\nCentre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said: \u201cThe Darling River is going into cardiac arrest and both the federal and NSW governments are asleep at the wheel of the ambulance.\u201d\nHe called on the federal government to step in and ensure that water from recent rain in Queensland was used to deal with the environmental emergency occurring in northern NSW and the Lower Darling.\n\u201cWith less than 250ML per day flowing over Weir 32 there must be no water flowing from the Darling River into the Murray. The Darling River, a river that is crucial for river flow through the Murray mouth and into the Coorong, is dying and the government is simply not acting.\u201d\n\u201cThe government cannot ignore what is going on. The river is stagnant, the government can\u2019t be\u201d.",

        "content": "Rami Malek was a popular winner, but it was disappointing to see Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book do better than The Favourite and Roma \nThis year\u2019s Golden Globes prize list looks like a mixed and somewhat middleweight bag \u2013 though with some resoundingly just choices. It is great to see Olivia Colman and Glenn Close rewarded for best actress, in the comedy and drama categories, for The Favourite and The Wife; and for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n to get best director for his superb autobiographical film Roma, which also picked up the best foreign language Globe.\nBut at first glance, the evening\u2019s real winner, and \u2013 to say the least \u2013 the surprise winner, is Bohemian Rhapsody with best film (drama) and best actor for Rami Malek. Malek was a popular choice: he is a tremendous actor and he is widely liked as one of the nicest guys in the business. The same thing can\u2019t be said for the film\u2019s credited director Bryan Singer (who left the film and was replaced by Dexter Fletcher midway through the shoot). Singer was icily uninvited and unmentioned in this ceremony, something between a Voldemort not to be named and a Banquo\u2019s ghost. Social media erupted in rage that at a time when the industry is supposed to have learned from #MeToo there are any reminders at all of the very impenitent Singer.\nHowever, Bohemian Rhapsody is the feelgood, feelnostalgic, feelexalted tribute to Freddie Mercury and his rise to stardom fronting Queen in the 1970s, culminating in their spectacular performance at Live Aid in 1985, an event which reasserted their popularity and which this movie contrives to suggest was a climactic moment for Mercury personally: a kind of lifetime achievement award, the supposed crux of a reconciliation with his parents, and a coming-to-terms with his being a person with HIV. Malek is absolutely terrific in this film: his performance has enormous energy and charm and he gives Mercury a breezy lovability in his offstage life. Arguably, the movie insists on a hetero-vanilla flavour which means that his existence as a gay man \u2013 whose identity is camouflaged by the glam rock aesthetic of the age \u2013 is a bit diluted. But there is, it seems to me, no dishonesty in the screenplay. It\u2019s great to see the moment when Freddie hands over an EP copy of his masterpiece to Kenny Everett. (Kenny Everett! Where is the biopic of Kenny Everett actually? Maybe Dickie Beau can develop his cameo here for a full-length film!) And it\u2019s also nice to see Mike Myers as glowering EMI boss Ray Foster (based on real-life Roy Featherstone). which takes us all back to Wayne\u2019s World, with Wayne and his buddies rocking out to Bohemian Rhapsody in their car.\nBut for me Malek\u2019s performance is a bigger achievement than the balsawood-constructed film itself \u2013 although the film is admittedly a great showcase for it. And for this likeable, but rather negligible movie to have beaten out If Beale Street Could Talk and A Star Is Born feels very wrong. It also feels disconcerting for Bohemian Rhapsody to have crowded out Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma, which as a non-English-language film was not eligible for the award \u2013 although Cuar\u00f3n was duly rewarded in the director category, ahead of Spike Lee, Adam McKay, Peter Farrelly and Bradley Cooper. Again, this seems fair: Roma is a kind of masterpiece and the HFPA have done the right thing here.\nThe second surprise winner is Green Book, a winner for best comedy or musical and for Mahershala Ali, best supporting actor for his performance as Don Shirley, the real-life pianist of the 1960s, brilliant and fastidious, being ferried around on tour in the Deep South by white driver Frank Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen. This they do with the help of the Green Book, a guide to hotels and restaurants where African-Americans could stay and eat with no (or at least a minimum of) racist harassment. Ali\u2019s poise and charisma in this role have been amply rewarded, and it is good to see this actor developing a career path to the top. But the movie itself is perhaps too obviously in the classic liberal white/black odd couple style.\nAgain, supporters of Barry Jenkins\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk may well be very disappointed to see that movie lose out in the screenplay, beaten out by Green Book. The same goes for The Favourite. However, it is great to see the Best supporting actress Globe go to Regina King for the subtlety and delicacy of her performance in Beale Street. It may well be that she will win the Oscar too \u2013 and in fact that Beale Street will come through strongly in the Academy Awards overall.\nChristian Bale was the winner for his exhilarating, menacing and very plausibly unpleasant rendition (if that is the mot juste) of Dick Cheney, the waterboarding enthusiast who once served as vice-president and power-behind-the-throne to George W Bush. It was a barnstormer of a performance, though in some ways it would have been nice to see the Globe go to John C Reilly for his performance as Oliver Hardy in Jon Baird\u2019s Stan & Ollie, or to Reilly and Steve Coogan jointly.\nGlenn Close is the worthiest of winners for her best actress performance in The Wife \u2013 a screen achievement I have been enthusing about since seeing it at Toronto back in 2017. The role is perfectly attuned to Close\u2019s mature style: powerful, pointed, restrained, cerebral, with a sheen of worldly disillusion. Surely she will go on now to win an Oscar? Well, she could be in for a fight with the UK\u2019s own Olivia Colman who has risen gloriously from the ranks of TV to film greatness with her staggeringly good and utterly unique performance as the dysfunctional Queen Anne in The Favourite, a performance that no one else could have even have guessed at.\nElsewhere, it is extremely satisfying to see the best animated film Globe go to one of the very best films on this list: Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, a film possessed of a kind of demonic genius, a delirious multiversal adventure, and a film which more than any of the Marvel films, perfectly captures the spirit of Marvel comics and its late founder, Stan Lee who appears in (animated) cameo.\nSo, mixed feelings about a mixed bag of results. For me, the take-home is Olivia Colman\u2019s triumph in The Favourite. Their film\u2019s team will have been disappointed not to have got best comedy or best screenplay, but it is a very satisfying win for one of the most distinctive actors working today.",

        "content": "The Sandra Bullock-starring horror movie has left critics cold but since its release, it\u2019s become a magnet for memes and racked up the platform\u2019s best film numbers ever\nThere was a sense of dread surrounding Netflix\u2019s release of survival horror Bird Box, and not just because of the terrifying premise.\nThe film, led by Sandra Bullock, was seen as one of the platform\u2019s splashier original offerings of 2018 with a juicy set-up, an in-demand director and a high-profile pre-Christmas release. But a last-minute marketing campaign planted seeds of doubt with a trailer that left many calling it an ill-timed, sense-swapped copy of A Quiet Place, released to critical and commercial success earlier in the year.\nWhile the John Krasinski/Emily Blunt thriller focused on monsters who used sound to hunt their victims, in Bird Box, a demonic force targets sight. For those unlucky enough to catch a glimpse, their greatest fears become realised. Netflix remained confident, despite bad buzz, and nabbed a slot at the AFI film festival alongside awards-friendly titles such as Roma and Green Book. They also targeted voters with a sneak peek Directors Guild of America screening in New York. Both promising signs of a prestige project.\nThen critics caught a glimpse and, well, fear was far from realised.\n\u201cA wannabe shocker \u2026 shortchanged in terms of suspense, scares and thrills,\u201d said the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Todd McCarthy. \u201cThese characters feel so crammed together and underwritten that they add up to almost nothing,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s Amy Nicholson. \u201cA toy-chest apocalypse in which the rules of the game are, to all appearances, never understood,\u201d complained the New Yorker\u2019s Richard Brody.\nThe reviews weren\u2019t quite as toxic as those that met Netflix\u2019s last big Christmas bet, the Will Smith-starring fantasy Bright, but they immediately put a stop to any awards chatter and pegged Bird Box as yet another misjudged original gamble. In a way, it seemed like the natural conclusion to a year that saw them spew out The Cloverfield Paradox, Mute, Extinction and TAU, all malformed attempts to prove they can take on the multiplex with genre film-making.\nUnlike those films however, Netflix granted Bird Box a campaign that rivaled the scale of its cinema-dwelling counterparts. Cities were strewn with billboards and digital ads, Bullock and director Susanne Bier (hot off award-winning miniseries The Night Manager) made their way around the interview circuit and the film was even given a one-week exclusive engagement on the big screen.\nWhile it has become notoriously hard to judge the success of a Netflix drop, given how the platform refuses to release viewership figures, it was clear that within days, Bird Box was an unqualified phenomenon. Not only did it start trending on Twitter but it soon became an unlikely meme-magnet.\n\"Could you see us being together\" Me: pic.twitter.com/VbadnRdJWv\nme after watching birdbox pic.twitter.com/DsuLUcyzzc\nThe blind when everyone was committing suicide in bird box pic.twitter.com/FoRBhs4MtZ\nThe reaction was so ebullient that it led Netflix to temporarily remove a different blindfold by tweet-bragging that over 45 million accounts had watched Bird Box in its first seven days, the biggest first week for one of their original films to date. While the release of an actual number (45,037,125, to be exact) might be somewhat groundbreaking given their reluctance to do so in the past, it follows on from a number of equally confident, if intentionally vaguer, statements about other 2018 releases.\nIn October\u2019s third-quarter earnings report, Netflix beamed over the results of their \u201cSummer of Love\u201d \u2013 a group of in-house romantic comedies that left most critics cold yet left subscribers fully engaged with over 80 million watching at least one of them and To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before singled out as a particular hit. In December, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos claimed that their festive adventure The Christmas Chronicles had the \u201cmost impact\u201d of any of star Kurt Russell\u2019s films to date with 20 million watching in the first week.\nThe Bird Box brag has left some industry figures unsure over the number\u2019s veracity. Firstly, it\u2019s not a figure that\u2019s been independently assessed unlike, say, Nielsen ratings or official box office results. Secondly, while Netflix has stated that a user watching at least 70% of a film counts as a view, it is unclear how many of the 45m streams were complete.\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan and proponent of Netflix, but to believe that nearly one-third of all of their subscribers not only watched 70% of the movie but did so in the first week of it being on the site is all but unfathomable,\u201d an anonymous producer told Business Insider over the weekend. \u201cI want to believe it but just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not a watch for the faint of heart, after all.\u201d\nBut regardless of the potentially troublesome nature of this number, the film\u2019s immediacy of impact is undeniable. In less than a month, Bird Box has already become part of the public lexicon in a way that would have been infinitely harder to achieve with a cinema-only release, provoking more chatter than last month\u2019s big screen hits combined. The film\u2019s viewership is so large that Kim Kardashian\u2019s tweet asking if anyone had yet seen it, just 10 days after release, was the subject of widespread ridicule. Fans have even turned the house featured in the film into a tourist attraction, showing up in droves to take blindfolded selfies.\nReactions reached a new fever pitch with the \u201cBird Box challenge\u201d which has seen fans blindfolding themselves before taking on various tasks from petting dogs to playing basketball to, most worryingly, driving. It all led to the official Netflix account tweeting: \u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a very careful consideration about how it translates,\u201d director Bier said to the Hollywood Reporter of the film\u2019s wildfire reaction. \u201cClassical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies all of it. But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into something.\u201d\nSo what is it about Bird Box that\u2019s led to such unprecedented success?\nBased on a novel by Josh Malerman, the rights to Bird Box were originally purchased by Universal in 2013 before it was even published. Mama director Andy Muschietti, who would go on to direct It, was attached and Arrival\u2019s Eric Heisserer was onboard to adapt. But the project fell apart and the script was then included in 2014\u2019s Black List, an annual roundup of the best unproduced screenplays knocking around Hollywood. Fast forward to 2017 and after one of the project\u2019s original producers joined Netflix, the film was suddenly brought to life.\nIt was reportedly made for less than $20m, a far more modest investment than some of the platform\u2019s more high-profile titles (Bright cost $90m while Outlaw King was made for a reported $120m), and given the consistency of the horror genre at the box office, the film would have undoubtedly made a tidy profit on the big screen. But as one analyst pointed out on Twitter, if those 45 million subscribers all bought a ticket to see it in the first week, it would have made roughly $411m in seven days, over $20m more than what The Force Awakens achieved in the same period.\nBut that\u2019s really the inarguable key to why Bird Box hit so hard because no matter what the release date, it\u2019s close to impossible imagining that such a large amount of people would have gone out and purchased tickets to see it. Netflix hasn\u2019t released figures for Bird Box\u2019s exclusive big screen engagement for the week before its streaming release, a likely sign that the numbers weren\u2019t quite so impressive.\nAs a consumer, the in-home premiere of a film with a snappy high-concept and an appealing A-list lead would seem like an early Christmas gift, requiring no greater commitment than pressing play. Bullock is a notoriously picky actor, even more so after her Oscar win for The Blind Side in 2013 and her cannily chosen projects since have mostly proved just how wide her appeal remains. In 2013, she scored two major hits with Gravity and The Heat and while 2015\u2019s Our Brand is Crisis was an Oscarbait misstep, her lead role in last year\u2019s Ocean\u2019s 8 was a resounding success, at least commercially, with almost $300m in the bank.\nWhile some pundits have suggested the film\u2019s success is a direct result of her star appeal, it\u2019s worth sharing the wealth with her ensemble, an almost algorithmically constructed cast of easy-to-place faces, picked with considerable skill. There\u2019s Moonlight\u2019s Trevante Rhodes, American Crime Story\u2019s Emmy-winning Sarah Paulson, veteran Oscar nominee John Malkovich, Get Out\u2019s Lil Rel Howery, rapper-turned-actor Machine Gun Kelly, two-time Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver, British stage and screen star Tom Hollander and Jurassic Park\u2019s BD Wong. It is a diverse, impressive cast with broad appeal and the constant unfolding of cameos makes it a hard film to switch off.\nAnother key to the film\u2019s mammoth consumption lies in Netflix\u2019s lack of certification. During the film\u2019s brief big screen release, it was rated R for violence, bloody images, language and brief sexuality, which would have restricted its audience and in turn, box office. But without parental supervision, Netflix is unburdened by such a hurdle, allowing anyone to watch, regardless of age.\nWhat will Netflix learn from such a landmark release? For starters, the dissonance between critical and public reaction to Bird Box implies that their products, if pitched right, can be critic-proof. This was already somewhat proved by their decision to renew Friends From College for a second season, one of 2018\u2019s most poorly reviewed shows, and a confirmed sequel for Bright.\nA long-running complaint about Netflix\u2019s ever-increasing selection of original movies is how many of them feel unceremoniously dumped and soon lost within an endless scroll. Bird Box\u2019s extravagant marketing campaign, the budget of which is of course being kept a secret, has shown that pitching a streaming release as if it\u2019s a big screen contender can pay off handsomely, keeping it in the memory of viewers for longer than just the day that it\u2019s launched. The company\u2019s awareness of the value of their viewing statistics to help figure out what future projects are worth betting on suggests that Bird Box will have an indelible effect on what\u2019s in store and the algorithmic assembly of the film suggests that such strategising is what led to its existence in the first place.\nBird Box landed in the same month as Roma, the critically adored drama from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n that\u2019s predicted to land Netflix its first best picture nomination and perhaps even a win. The almost simultaneous release of both act as a close-to-perfect distillation of what the company is trying to achieve: arthouse acclaim and mainstream dominance. Both also launched on the precipice of Netflix\u2019s biggest year to date with Martin Scorsese\u2019s new gangster drama The Irishman starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s art world thriller Velvet Buzzsaw and Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Panama Papers drama with Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman, to name just a few. It\u2019s an impressive slate for any studio and while the established big-hitters, from Disney to Warners, have been doggedly keeping their blindfolds on since Netflix entered the fray, unwilling to view a streaming platform as a serious challenger, 2019 might see them reluctantly taking them off to face the terrifying truth that lies ahead.",

She had asserted her independence and renounced Islam but had been forced to pray, wear a hijab and was beaten by her brother.\nQunun is understood to have fled from her family two days ago.

        "content": "The new Chelsea player is the latest of a number of Americans making moves to big European clubs. But the US youth system remains fractured and fractious\nOf all the tales told of the USA\u2019s failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, the most haunting depicts Christian Pulisic, after the fateful draw away to Trinidad & Tobago, in the showers \u201cfully clothed, with his hands in his face just crying,\u201d as Dax McCarty described it. Only Pulisic knows what was going through his mind in that moment, but on some level he, as his country\u2019s best player, surely felt a level of responsibility for American soccer\u2019s biggest, most humiliating failure in a generation.\nOf course, Pulisic is one of the few US players who warrant a free pass for what happened in World Cup qualification. Not to go over old ground, but he was a leader, the kind Bruce Arena\u2019s side could have used more of. Still, Pulisic\u2019s tears in the showers were revealing. They painted the picture of a figure burdened by expectation and the pressure that comes with being American soccer\u2019s first male superstar.\nThis status was confirmed with Pulisic\u2019s \u20ac64m move to Chelsea last week. John Brooks had previously been the most expensive player in American soccer history, joining Wolfsburg for \u20ac20m back in 2017. Pulisic\u2019s transfer fee more than tripled that record. Never before has US soccer been so close to having the global icon it longs for.\nTherein lies a paradox for the American game. The failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup opened up chasms within US soccer, with a keenly contested, sometimes toxic, presidential election focusing on a fractured youth infrastructure. The establishment candidate, Carlos Cordeiro, ultimately won, seeing off more radical outsiders who promised fundamental change, but the debate over American soccer\u2019s future remains.\nBut just how bad are American youth soccer\u2019s problems when Chelsea have just made Pulisic the third-most expensive player in their history? On top of this, Tyler Adams, the teenage midfielder who made such an impression in MLS last season, made the move to RB Leipzig last month, US international goalkeeper Zack Steffen signed for Manchester City and US Under-20 centre-back Chris Richards joined Bayern Munich from FC Dallas this week.\nThen there\u2019s Weston McKennie, the defensive midfielder who helped Schalke to a second-place finish in his breakout season, while Timothy Weah has turned heads with some of his performances for Paris-Saint Germain, and may join Celtic. If American soccer has a youth problem, then it is doing a good job of masking it.\nThat\u2019s the thing, though. Masking is exactly what these high-profiles are. They mustn\u2019t be taken as a vindication of the \u2018pay-to-play\u2019 culture that exists at youth levels of the American game, of the divisions between organisations, associations and federations all with different aims and ambitions or of the US\u2019s refusal to participate in Fifa\u2019s solidarity payments scheme which would have seen Pulisic\u2019s youth team, the PA Classics, receive around $540,000 as part of his transfer to Chelsea.\nWhen it comes to youth development, American soccer, in general, attempts to occupy a space between the club-led grassroots philosophy favoured in Europe and the collegial approach of traditional US sports. Until soccer in the States picks one approach over the other, the same issues will recur.\nAmerican soccer could do with opening itself up, with becoming a bit more European, particularly when it comes to youth development. It\u2019s admirable that so much faith continues to be shown in the college system, giving players an education to fall back on if they don\u2019t make it as professionals, but that faith puts American soccer players at a disadvantage from a young age.\nSome may argue, with good reason, that European soccer fails its young players as people, allowing so many to drop out of the game with few qualifications. But if American soccer wants to catch up, to close the gap at grassroots level, then it must change its entire outlook. If the objective is to produce the best soccer players possible, the current set-up is insufficient. US Soccer has become a target for those with an axe to grind over youth development in the States, but there\u2019s more to the problem than just a fracture in governance. It\u2019s ideological too.\nEuropean soccer\u2019s youth approach might be wasteful, maybe even irresponsible, but it cultivates talent en masse in a way the US game doesn\u2019t. Had Pulisic stayed in America rather than making the move to Germany as a 14-year-old, coming through the NCAA system and into the MLS draft, it\u2019s likely he would be making his breakthrough only now. Instead, he has played three seasons in the Bundesliga, captained his country and made a mega-money move to an elite Premier League club all by the age of 20.\nPulisic bristles at the notion that he succeeded in spite of US soccer, not because of it, but there\u2019s no denying he is an exceptional case. If he were the norm, if he was a true reflection of soccer in the States, the American game wouldn\u2019t have suffered the existential crisis it did in 2018. The deep sense of malaise would have shifted by now. A \u20ac64m transfer to a Premier League giant might seem like cause for US soccer to celebrate. Instead, it holds up a mirror to a highly dysfunctional soccer nation that has succeeded only in producing a \u20ac64m anomaly.",

Colette was way ahead of her time \u2013 and no biopic has done justice to her complexity\n\u201cTen thirty \u2026 once again I\u2019m ready too soon.\u201d So begins Colette\u2019s 1910 novel The Vagabond, in the immediately compelling voice of Ren\u00e9e N\u00e9r\u00e9, a Parisian music hall artist staring at her made-up face in the dressing-room mirror. \u201cI\u2019d better open that book lying on the make-up shelf, even though I\u2019ve read it over and over again \u2026 otherwise I\u2019ll find myself all alone, face to face with that painted mentor who gazes at me from the other side of the looking-glass \u2026\u201d And that, with all the introspection it would bring, would never do. But at last \u201cthe first bars of our overture strike up [and] I feel soothed and ready for anything, grown all of a sudden gay and irresponsible \u2026 From that moment I no longer belong to myself, and all is well.\u201d\nThe shock of The Vagabond, even if one has read it before, is how immediate, funny and fresh it is; how closely observed, compassionate but also unsentimental, especially about the dignity and hurt, illness and poverty hidden behind the gaudy coats of Ren\u00e9e\u2019s fellow cast-members; above all, how fundamentally \u201ctoo soon\u201d it feels, even now, in its supple weighing-up of the choices available to a woman who also happens to be an artist, and the costs of those choices.\nAnd one of the many striking things about Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who was born in rural Burgundy in 1873 and died in Paris in 1954, is the sheer number of ways in which she herself existed \u201ctoo soon\u201d. She wrote novels, short stories, essays, memoirs and as a journalist reported on everything from domestic violence to the front lines of the first world war, from anorexia to literature, from fashion and cooking to fake orgasms. She devised silent film scenarios, wrote a libretto for a Ravel opera, and scripted pantomimes \u2013 in which she acted. She was a successful mime and dancer, opened a chain of beauty salons (demonstrating makeovers on her daughter) and was an enthusiastic early adopter of everything from sushi to weightlifting, perms to acupuncture and facelifts. She was for a while the literary editor of le Matin, was married three times, had relationships with women \u2013 and with her second husband\u2019s 16-year-old son.\nWhen Proust died, many called her the most talented writer France now had; others claimed she could have taken that crown while he was still alive. She was nominated for the 1948 Nobel prize and although denied a Catholic funeral (for being divorced) was the first French female writer to be given a state funeral. \u201cIn the prize ring of life,\u201d John Updike once noted, \u201cfew of us would have lasted 10 rounds with Colette.\u201d No film could begin to do justice to the range of her experience, so those who have attempted it \u2013 Danny Huston with Becoming Colette (1991), and now Wash Westmoreland with Colette, starring Keira Knightley \u2013 wisely do not try, focusing instead on her eventful enough late teens and 20s.\nWhen Colette finished her first, autobiographical novel, Claudine at School, she was amazed. \u201cI have discovered an astonishing young girl,\u201d she wrote, in a letter to a friend. \u201cDo you know who she is? She is exactly me before my marriage\u201d: a wild country child, at home in fields and woods, musical, mischievous, with braids so long they rested, coiled \u201clike a sleeping python\u201d, as Colette\u2019s biographer Judith Thurman has it, on the chair beside her. It was not the first time Colette described her adolescent self in tones of elegy and would not be the last.\nThe marriage that ended her teens had not been easy. She was 20, Henry Gauthier-Villars, or Willy, was 34, a saloni\u00e8re and womaniser who in their first year of matrimony laid Colette low with a combination of what sounds like depression (not least because she had discovered him with another woman) and what Thurman suspects was a severe case of gonorrhoea. A literary and theatrical wheeler-dealer, he put his own name to Claudine at School, as he did with the many writers, both male and female, who actually produced the work that made him famous. In The Vagabond, the first novel Colette published under her own name, he becomes a famous painter whose \u201conly genius \u2026 was for lying\u201d.\nBut Colette always also knew that the shock of marriage contained something greater than her own experience of a specific man: it ended any sense of independent sovereignty. And that existential shock, sometimes given to young men, too, reverberates through her fiction \u2013 from the offhand but sincere worry the courtesan L\u00e9a displays for the teenager her self-absorbed lover Ch\u00e9ri is about to marry, in Ch\u00e9ri (1920), to the masterful, quiet short novel \u201cThe Cat\u201d (1933), in which a gentle only boy marries \u201can amorous and untamed young woman\u201d. Marriage, even to someone who is kind and true is, as she puts it in The Vagabond, a \u201clong drawn-out voluptuousness, suspended, fanned, renewed, the winged fall, the swooning in which one\u2019s strength is renewed by its own death\u201d.\nClaudine at School was followed by Claudine and Annie, Claudine in Paris and Claudine Married. These early autofictions were instant bestsellers: \u201cin purely commercial terms,\u201d as the French scholar Claude Pichois put it, their success \u201cis one of the greatest, if not the greatest in all French literature\u201d. (A famous story, which originated with Colette and is reproduced in the new film, is that Willy locked her in a room in their country house for four hours a day to increase productivity. Thurman, alive to Colette\u2019s self-mythologising, is unconvinced: their city home did not function like that, and in the country Colette, unable to concentrate, seems to have asked her husband to imprison her.) By the last volume, Claudine Married, Colette was reporting on a menage a trois almost in real time, with the protagonists so lightly disguised that the other woman, the American wife of a wealthy French mining engineer, had the novel pulped. But Willy, wily as ever, had retained copyright, and it was rushed out regardless.\nThe fin de si\u00e8cle world in which Colette came of age was one where performance reigned: in the music halls; in the grand salons, where, especially if you were an outsider like the provincial Colette, you were expected to perform an exaggerated version of yourself \u2013 which, if not a great foundation for happiness, was at least very good training for a writer. It was also a world in which lesbianism was effectively accepted \u2013 there was a thriving underground network of lesbian bars and restaurants, codes and gestures, and for six years at the end of her marriage Colette\u2019s lover was a cross-dressing noblewoman, the Marquise de Belbeuf, nicknamed Missy, with whom, for one night, she performed at the Moulin Rouge: their kiss incited a near-riot. Westmoreland\u2019s Colette suggests Willy had little objection to their relationship because it did not threaten him as adultery with a man would have done. More interesting is to see it from the women\u2019s point of view: intimacy on an equal footing; freedom of the mind, and from entrapping children. (Though Colette did not, when she eventually conceived a daughter with her second husband, Henry de Jouvenel, let that get in the way: Colette de Jouvenel, also called Bel-Gazou, often did not see her mother for six months at a time.)\nYet Colette found organised feminism profoundly irritating. \u201cYou know what the suffragettes deserve?\u201d she demanded once. \u201cThe whip and the harem.\u201d She was both a libertine and fitfully conservative. And racist, too (even though, or because, she had African antecedents through ancestors who had owned slaves in Martinique). During the occupation she wrote for the collaborationist press and in 1941 published Julie de Carneilhan, full of anti-Jewish slurs, while at the same time having many Jewish friends; her last and longest marriage was to a Jewish man, Maurice Goudeket, who was jailed by the Gestapo in the second world war.\nA more nuanced position reveals itself in her writing, however. Ch\u00e9ri for instance, begins with a beautiful ageing courtesan preparing to take her leave of the gorgeous, selfish young man who has been her lover for six years. Once you get past the visceral disgust/fear of the older female body it is full of respect for women who work out how to play the game of sex to their own advantage: L\u00e9a and her friends are epicures \u2013 tough, ambitious, independent businesswomen. Like The Vagabond, it is also clear-eyed about the costs: the challenge of living alone; of filling days with meaning. L\u00e9a, whose currency has been her essentially passive body \u2013 unlike Ren\u00e9e\u2019s dancer and writer \u2013 finds it overwhelmingly difficult, far more so than her proud and polished nonchalance has equipped her to endure. Another great strength of Ch\u00e9ri is its domestic accuracy, especially about the shifting sands between two people alone in a room, the vanity and careless cruelty, the weird dance between love and clarity \u2013 \u201cYou never laugh except unkindly \u2013 at people,\u201d L\u00e9a tells Ch\u00e9ri, \u201cand that makes you ugly\u201d. There is also the way in which people behave, so often counterintuitively and according to urges they did not suspect they possessed.\nAnd this, if Colette had a creed, might be where it lies: in an adamant insistence on the irreducibly individual \u2013 just as she, throughout her life, insisted on her own right to be so. Gigi (a luminous 1944 novella and eventually a Broadway play that made Audrey Hepburn, hand-picked by Colette, famous, and a 1958 Hollywood film) is the story of a teenager being raised by her grandmother and great-aunt while her mother does long hours playing lowly parts in the serious theatre. The older women are taking her in hand, imparting the rarefied etiquette of the high society courtesan, not least how to avoid \u201cordinary people, that is to say, useless people\u201d. Gigi prefers playing card games with a friend of a family, a beet sugar baron who drops by to escape the latest tittle-tattle about his eligible bachelorship in the press. When he proposes, her response causes consternation to the worldly courtesans, who are unable to understand her refusal to play the game.\nThe Vagabond, meanwhile, ends with Ren\u00e9e touring the south of France, having accepted an insistent, wealthy young fan as a lover, knowing he wishes to marry her as soon as she gets back. She is tempted, but as her return looms, she begins to see things more clearly. Of course she would love to be loved. To be safe. To escape the drudgery of touring (Colette once did 32 performances on consecutive nights, in 32 different towns). But the drudgery is also the price of independence. How to hold on to that, and also be what society understands a woman to be? For days she weighs it up, until a moment comes when she realises Max has not been in her thoughts at all. Instead, she has been looking for words, \u201cwords to express how yellow the sun is, how blue the sea, and how brilliant the salt like a fringe of white jet. Yes, [I have] forgotten him, as if the only urgent thing in the world were my desire to possess through my eyes the marvels of the earth. In that same hour an insidious spirit whispered to me: \u2018And if indeed that were the only urgent thing? If everything, save that, were merely ashes?\u2019\u201d\n Colette is on release in the UK from 9 January.",

For months, the Super League chief executive has promised a revolution for British rugby league\u2019s elite competition amid a backdrop of boardroom politics but you sense the 54-year-old finally feels as though he is making progress as 2019 begins.\nLast week Super League unveiled its self-titled \u201cnew beginnings\u201d for 2019; a series of law changes aimed at revolutionising the image of the competition. Interchanges have been reduced, while shot clocks designed to speed up games and golden point extra-time are being implemented for 2019 \u2013 but Elstone\u2019s plans for change do not end there. \u201cSuper League will be different in 2019, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see a much better-looking competition in 2020 and the years after that. That\u2019s a guarantee.\u201d\nExpanding Super League\u2019s global reach is high on Elstone\u2019s agenda, underlined by the possibility that the traditional Magic Weekend could have an international flavour to it sooner rather than later, with Barcelona a likely venue for the event. In May, Catalans will host the reigning champions, Wigan, at the Camp Nou and while Magic will have a new home at Anfield in 2019, Elstone admits that the success of that game in Catalonia could set the stage for all 12 clubs to play in Barcelona at some point.\n\u201cIf that worked, then it would increase the chances of Magic going there without question,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI think Wigan playing Catalans there is the most incredible development we\u2019ve had for years. It\u2019s a huge statement and it creates huge traction beyond our traditional circles. Super League has to get out of its own bubble, and the Nou Camp helps do that. It\u2019s not lost on me that our sport has a rebellious soul, and was founded out of injustice. If there\u2019s one region of the world that captures that, it\u2019s Catalonia.\u201d\nAs the former Everton CEO begins to share his vision for a sport he began watching on the terraces of Castleford over 40 years ago, it is not difficult to see the strains of the first six months in the job showing. Most of that period was spent entrenched in a public dispute with prominent lower-league clubs about a restructure of the leagues in 2019, which was successfully achieved in September, with confirmation that the Super 8s format would end in 2018.\nDespite that victory, Elstone is in no mood to stand still. Next month he will move a new-look team of staff \u2013 many of whom have been poached from the RFL \u2013 out of the governing body\u2019s headquarters in Salford into the centre of Manchester, emphasising the differing directions of the two parties moving into 2019. Talk of a split between Super League and the RFL is not wide of the mark.\n\u201cGetting a group of people focused solely on Super League is well overdue,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the competition got the focus that it should have had. A big part of all this is about giving the competition accountability. We\u2019re accountable for our actions now so there\u2019s a spotlight on us we\u2019re conscious of, but one we\u2019re excited about. We need to break out of our bubble and aim big for this competition.\u201d\nPart of Elstone\u2019s vision includes, by his own admission, looking to Australia\u2019s NRL for inspiration. \u201cI\u2019ll no doubt be branded an NRL sycophant,\u201d he smiles when explaining why Super League has emulated the NRL in adopting golden point extra-time. \u201cThe drama of a period of time to decide a winner excites me,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were a number of variations on the table, including golden try rather than golden point, but aligning ourselves with the NRL was the major factor.\u201d\nOther significant changes will follow in 2020, including the introduction of two referees per game rather than one: a law amendment again inspired by the NRL. \u201cWe came close to doing it in 2019, and had club approvals and budgets signed off, but it was just too late,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019ll see it in 2020 though. With the changes to speed the game up, it will put undoubted pressure on officials in 2019. We have to listen to referees and give them more help in-game, and a second referee does that.\u201d\nThe Man of Steel award will change from an end-of-season dinner to a week-by-week voting process that is made public throughout, while the World Club Challenge will also receive a \u201clong-term focus\u201d as part of Elstone\u2019s plans for overhaul. Yet despite all that, Elstone concedes the challenge of giving Super League increased profile in a world where everyone is fighting for attention will be a difficult ask.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough recognisable stars at present, and that\u2019s high on our agenda,\u201d Elstone says. \u201cGetting cut-through in the modern world is harder than ever, but we think we can get our players out there with third-party endorsements and commercial deals now that Super League has proper focus. We have to stand together and acknowledge the future of the competition is in our own hands. The game was at a crossroads in this country, and it was time for Super League to take action. Thankfully, there are grounds for real optimism now we\u2019ve done that.\u201d",

        "content": "What\u2019s life like after being in a successful pop group? Members of Eternal, Honeyz and Bananarama discuss trauma, triumph and teaching Gary Barlow yoga\nAs jobs go, being in a girl band has to be up there with ice-cream taster, rollercoaster designer and being Cher. But what do you do when it\u2019s time to mothball the double denim and Buffalo boots? If you need to work, chances are you will look for something reliable that\u2019s more rewarding than having your bum digitally reduced so you\u2019re fit for public consumption.\n\u201cI wanted to do something where people don\u2019t constantly decide if you\u2019re good enough,\u201d explains Mariama Goodman, veteran of girl groups Honeyz and Solid HarmoniE. \u201cTo be in a career where if you work hard you do well.\u201d That career was midwifery. Goodman explains that she didn\u2019t want a desk job, she wanted to meet people and face different challenges every day: a bit like a pop star, but without the croptops. \u201cI was always completely fascinated with babies and childbirth,\u201d she says, \u201cso I applied and got accepted. It was a shock to the system to start buying pencil cases when you\u2019d been doing what I had been, but I went back to university and got a first.\u201d\nThe euphoria of performing on stage has been replaced with the longer-lasting satisfaction of helping people, but in a way she still has big hits: there was the time she delivered a baby in a car park, in minus 5C in the middle of winter. \u201cThe dad had to shove the baby up his jumper to keep it warm, while the mum was having a haemorrhage on the back seat,\u201d she says, terrifyingly. Suddenly forgetting your words at Party in the Park doesn\u2019t seem like quite such a big deal. \u201cAt the end of that shift I felt very good about myself,\u201d she laughs.\nKelle Bryan was in Eternal, the biggest girl band of the 90s until the Spice Girls, so going back to education was hard. Not simply because of the funny looks she got, but because she wasn\u2019t sure she could hack it. \u201cI joined the band at 15 and didn\u2019t get to do further education, and to be fair I never thought I\u2019d be able to, because at school I was always told: \u2018You\u2019re black, you\u2019re stupid, you\u2019re this, you\u2019re that, you\u2019re the other.\u2019 Then I did my masters in artistic professional development, and was like: \u2018Actually I can do this.\u2019\u201d\nIt took Bryan a while to get her business up and running. \u201cI was an absolute hustler,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI started with a pay-as-you-go mobile, fax machine and faked that I had an assistant.\u201d She assures me that the assistant who set up our interview is real. \u201cWhen I needed to make landline calls I would run to the telephone box, I\u2019m not kidding you, and answer the phone: \u2018Good afternoon, Red Hot Entertainment [the name of her former company].\u2019\u201d\nFast forward 10 years and Bryan\u2019s business Advocate Agency is legit: she discovered the new Jasmine for Disney\u2019s live-action remake of Aladdin and gave Ricky Norwood his break on EastEnders. \u201cI was always told that I would amount to nothing when I was younger, so I\u2019m a big supporter of people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be given the opportunity. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve made my niche,\u201d she says.\nWhen Jacquie O\u2019Sullivan, the woman who replaced Bananarama\u2019s Siobhan Fahey in the group in 1988, found herself back in the real world she says had a \u201cmini breakdown\u201d. Her mother died, her boyfriend left her and she lost her house. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d she recalls. It took a while but the thing that helped her through all the loss was yoga. \u201cIt really changed my life,\u201d she tells me at breakfast, minutes after I take a class with her in Covent Garden. \u201cI gave up all the naughty stuff I was doing, I stopped wanting to get drunk and I stopped smoking because I wanted to get up to go to yoga the next day.\u201d\nBut the chakras were shaken when O\u2019Sullivan went to an ashram to become a teacher, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI thought I was going to be cutting a few poses and that would be it, but I was up at three in the morning, I had to meditate for two hours, my food was served on the floor, and I was fresh from London, the big \u2018I Am\u2019.\u201d She found the constant chanting eye roll-inducing at first, but by day three she was finally kissing goodbye to her pop star persona. \u201cThey said: \u2018Who\u2019s judging you, but you?\u2019 So I let it all go and it was amazing. For the first time, I felt free.\u201d\nO\u2019Sullivan qualified as an instructor years before it was trendy and still teaches yoga flow in central London and at juicing retreats around the world: Gary Barlow, Alesha Dixon and Jason Donovan are regulars.\nEvery one of the women I spoke to seemed content with their new lives. While a cynical reader might believe that they secretly pine for their girl band glory days, the reasons they give for leaving the groups often sound potent enough to put them off pop for good. It all comes down to girl power: who has it and who doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cI distinctly remember my first meeting with the Honeyz,\u201d recalls Goodman, when she was the new girl replacing founding member Heavenli Denton in 1999, \u201cand one of the girls who was an inch shorter than me saying: \u2018Well she can\u2019t wear heels, because she can\u2019t be taller than me.\u2019 Then a bit later she said: \u2018You just don\u2019t seem grateful enough to be here.\u2019\u201d Goodman still can\u2019t quite believe the cheek, but this seems to be a recurring narrative: the manipulative double jab of \u2018How much do you want it?\u2019 and \u2018What are you prepared to sacrifice to keep it?\u2019\n\u201cIt got to the point where I was crying on my way to work,\u201d sighs Goodman, \u201cand obviously that\u2019s not what you dream of.\u201d\nBryan reveals that as strained as it was, she eventually fell into a routine. \u201cI was almost numb. You put your game face on, don\u2019t you? Go to work, do your job, come home.\u201d\nWhen O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s feelings of being the outsider got too much, a self-fulfilling prophecy, she made things worse. \u201cI was a feral young girl, I\u2019d come from a band with a punk mentality (girl group the Shillelagh Sisters) and literally didn\u2019t wash, I was so wild, and when I joined this band that felt like a machine, I didn\u2019t deal with it very well. I was self-medicating, not turning up for interviews, and at the end it got so bad that Hillary [Shaw], our manager, would be ringing round hotels to see if I was there, cos we were supposed to be flying off to do a show.\u201d\nIt becomes clear that some of our worst assumptions about girls in girl bands are true. When I ask Goodman to describe her time in Honeyz she says one word: \u201cDrama.\u201d Bryan claims that in Eternal the Bennett sisters controlled everything. \u201cI think they would agree that they come from a very strong family with a firm set of core beliefs \u2013 and coming into that was tough,\u201d she admits.\nDrama may be the name of Bananarama\u2019s excellent comeback album from 2005, but O\u2019Sullivan is keen to stress that there was none between them, not exactly. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know when I joined the band, was that Sara [Dallin] and Keren [Woodward] had known each other since they were kids,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe never had horrible words ever but I was there to fill the space, and I got the impression that they would\u2019ve much rather gone on as a duo,\u201d which of course they did later, although fans have a fondness for the \u201cJacquie years\u201d and so does she. \u201cI hold no grudges. I didn\u2019t take any responsibility for myself and how I was acting back then and now I do. If I saw the girls I\u2019d be happy to give them a big hug.\u201d\nGoodman doesn\u2019t have much time for anything beyond her nine to five, but her experience in girl bands comes in surprisingly handy. \u201cThere\u2019s still a hierarchy in the NHS,\u201d she says, lowering her voice, \u201cbut I never respected that as a thing, because when you\u2019ve just come off stage at the O2, I\u2019m not going to be intimidated by some junior consultant.\u201d",

        "content": "An absent mother returns to give family life another go in an extraordinary story by two giants of the genre\nIn the hand, this extraordinary collaboration between Charles Forsman, whose graphic novel The End of the Fxxxing World is now an acclaimed Netflix show, and Max de Radigu\u00e8s, the Belgian cartoonist who brought us the brilliant Bastard, seems a little on the flimsy side: at only 62 pages, you can read it in about the same time it takes to make a decent omelette. But don\u2019t be deceived. Hobo Mom is a slyly subversive book, and it stalks some unexpectedly bleak emotional territory. Alone in the quiet days after Christmas, I picked it up casually, thinking it might distract me from the industrial quantities of chocolate in the house. I then spent most of the rest of the day weeping \u2013 at which point the chocolate, predictably, really came into its own.\nWhat are we to make of those who find they\u2019re not suited to motherhood? Society still has so little time for them; even feminist biographers have been known to struggle with subjects who abandoned or neglected their children. At the heart of Hobo Mom is one such woman: Natasha, who when we first meet her has just returned to the home in small-town rural America she seemingly left some years ago, desperate to see her small daughter, Sissy, who lives now in perfect contentment with her father, Tom, and her rabbit, Hazel. Naturally, Tom, still wrapped tight in his hurt, isn\u2019t pleased by this sudden reappearance: she can stay, he insists, only if she agrees not to reveal to Sissy her true identity for the duration of her visit. After a few days, however, a thaw sets in. He and Natasha end up in bed together, and she agrees, in the fuzzy, faltering voice of one who is sleepwalking, to give their relationship another go.\nThe reader knows what\u2019s coming before Natasha does. The dangling weight of a tyre swing on which Sissy likes to play soon starts to resemble a collar or noose. Sure enough, while Tom is out working as a locksmith, Natasha is left to contemplate the various bolts she has drawn again across the door of her life. Her eyes, two dull dots, take them all in: a laundry basket, a kitchen sink, a bathroom shelf, an empty mailbox. Will she stay, or will she go? You might just as well ask: will she live, or will she die?\nThis is a remarkable graphic novel. Forsman and Radigu\u00e8s seem to understand instinctively that while one person\u2019s search for happiness may be the cause of another\u2019s deep pain, accepting daily sadness as a kind of life tax won\u2019t, in the end, make things better for anyone. Also, that an absent parent is not necessarily an unloving one. Some people \u2013 some women, even \u2013 do this sort of thing better at a distance. Their survival may even depend on it.\n Hobo Mom by Charles Forsman and Max de Radigu\u00e8s is published by Fantagraphics (\u00a312.99).

        "content": "Simon Stevens says senior doctors are urging better care for major health emergencies\nA \u201ctougher and faster\u201d set of waiting-time standards is needed for some patients attending accident and emergency departments, the NHS England chief executive has said.\nThe four-hour A&E waiting-time target was not well understood, Simon Stevens said on Monday as he discussed the the NHS\u2019s \u00a320bn 10-year plan, which will launch on Monday, pledging to transform the health service.\nStevens told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cOn A&E services, we think we actually need a tougher, faster set of standards for some major conditions than we\u2019ve got at the moment. \n \u201cThe four-hour target is not terribly well understood \u2013 people think it\u2019s four hours to start treatment. It\u2019s actually four hours to have been assessed, to have your tests done and for the treatment to have been completed, and, if it hasn\u2019t been, for you to be admitted to a hospital in-patient bed.\n\u201cThe problem with that is it doesn\u2019t distinguish between turning up at A&E with a sprained finger versus turning up with a heart attack.\u201d\nHe said senior doctors were advising that the standards should focus particularly on major conditions, such as sepsis, heart attacks and strokes. \n \u201cAt the other end of the spectrum, there are conditions for which previously you would have had to be admitted and stay overnight in hospital, but you can now actually have your care sorted out on the same day. \n \u201cThe top doctors in the NHS are looking at what are the most appropriate clinical standards to improve outcomes in emergency care. They will make their recommendations and, on the back of that, we will meet them,\u201d he said.\nDetails of how the NHS intends to dramatically reduce the number of people dying from conditions with high mortality rates, such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes, will be set out in the plan.\nIt will explain how the NHS will spend the extra funding Theresa May announced last year, marking its 70th birthday, which will increase the budget in England from \u00a3115bn to \u00a3135bn by 2023-24.\nExperts have said the plan must avoid presenting an undeliverable wishlist that makes too many promises and sets up the NHS to fail.\nHowever, Stevens said: \u201cThat is not what we have got. I know we have not got that as the plan has been drawn up by leaders of hospitals, nurses, senior doctors, patients\u2019 groups and by the NHS itself.\u201d\nAsked how the NHS could respond to Philip Hammond\u2019s demand for cuts in waste, Stevens said: \u201c[The chancellor] is quite right about that. The good news is we have one of the most efficient health services in the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do better.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cProductivity in the NHS has been growing faster than across the economy as a whole over the last several years. We have a very efficient health service, but everybody can see we can be more efficient.\u201d\nThe NHS chief also said the NHS was working closely with the government to avoid disruption to healthcare as a result of Brexit. \n  \u201cWe have been focusing particularly on medicines supply,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously closely linked to the availability of good transport arrangements post-Brexit, including freight by sea and air. \n  \u201cThe Department of Health and Social Care, which leads on this, are working very closely with us to put in place contingency plans.\u201d \n  Asked what the impact of Brexit would be on staffing, Stevens said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got about 5% of NHS staff that come from the rest of the European Union. That\u2019s very important, 65,000 people. \n  \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that we are able to provide the reassurance that they continue to be immensely important and very welcome going forward. \n  \u201cIt will clearly be important that we have a sensible approach to being able to continue to recruit internationally to the NHS, alongside the expansion in domestically trained staff.\u201d",

        "content": "The muscular blank verse of this great classic reveals a visionary amalgam of the biblical and the classical\nFrom Paradise Lost, Book Two\nHe ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, \n But glad that now his sea should find a shore,\n With fresh alacrity and force renewed\n Springs upward like a pyramid of fire\n Into the wild expanse, and through the shock\n Of fighting elements, on all sides round \n Environed wins his way; harder beset\n And more endangered, than when Argo pass\u2019d\n Through Bosporus, betwixt the jostling Rocks:\n Or when Ulysses on the larbord shunned\n Charybdis, and by the other whirlpool steered. \n So he with difficulty and labour hard\n Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;\n But he once past, soon after when man fell,\n Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain\n Following his track, such was the will of heaven, \n Paved after him a broad and beaten way\n Over the dark abyss, whose boiling gulf\n Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length\n From Hell continued reaching the utmost orb\n Of this frail world; by which the spirits perverse \n With easy intercourse pass to and fro\n To tempt or punish mortals, except whom\n God and good angels guard by special grace.\n But now at last the sacred influence\n Of light appears, and from the walls of heaven \n Shoots far into the bosom of dim night\n A glimmering dawn; here nature first begins\n Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire\n As from her outmost works a broken foe\n With tumult less and with less hostile din, \n That Satan with less toil, and now with ease\n Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light\n And like a weather-beaten vessel holds\n Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;\n Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, \n Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold\n Far off the empyreal heaven, extended wide\n In circuit, undetermined square or round,\n With opal towers and battlements adorned\n Of living sapphire, once his native seat; \n And fast by hanging in a golden chain\n This pendent world, in bigness as a star\n Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.\n Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,\n Accurst, and in a curs\u00e8d hour he hies.\nEvery so often I put on my sports bra, flex a few surprised muscles and head to the literary gym of some major classic. There\u2019s no pressure any more: I can read as slowly as I like, and replace the bookmark guiltlessly if I fancy a snooze. Though it may be a return visit, I\u2019m guaranteed to find all sorts of new treasure.\nThis week I\u2019ve been revisiting Paradise Lost. It started with a comment on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Too often parochial, patronising and predictable, the programme recovered its form in the New Horizons edition on New Year\u2019s Day. The context was the Ultima Thule flyby. A space-travel pioneer, being interviewed, mentioned seeing the world for the first time, \u201clike Milton\u2019s Satan\u201d. My antennae double-sparked. Everyone loves Milton\u2019s Satan, and I\u2019m no exception. I laced up my trainers, and prepared for some Miltonic weightlifting.\nThe passage chosen here comes at the close of the poem\u2019s second book. Satan, a consummate politician, has already established himself. He\u2019s visited Pandaemonium (rich parallels with Milton\u2019s political landscape, and ours) and won the parliamentary vote allowing him to bring mayhem to God\u2019s favoured new creation, the human race. Having negotiated with the demons and schmoozed his magnificently horrible relatives, his daughter Sin and their incestuous offspring Death, Satan passes through the gates of Hell. He visits Chaos, and, naturally, gets Chaos\u2019s approval for his New Horizons mission, too: \u201cHavoc and spoil and ruin are my gain.\u201d And so the journey and our extract begin.\nThis time round, I wanted to know about Milton\u2019s cosmology. I made a a start with this interesting essay, The Structure of Milton\u2019s Universe, which sometimes offers clarification and is frank when it can\u2019t. There are pictures, too, as there are in Philip Pullman\u2019s lovingly rebellious writer\u2019s commentary.\nWhat I\u2019ve realised more keenly than before is the extensive depth of Milton\u2019s classical infrastructure. It goes well beyond the mining of Greek myth for analogy and metaphor. Milton\u2019s very cosmos is at least sometimes Greek. For example, his image of the world hanging from a golden chain can be found in Homer\u2019s Iliad. In fact, according to this cosmological inheritance, the world seen by Satan is not Earth, as the Today astronaut thought: it\u2019s the universe.\nIt\u2019s difficult for us to envisage the universe as a globe, however vast. The image is too static, too tidy. Rather more accessible is Milton\u2019s concept of primordial Chaos, a messily physical region that might correspond with our idea of the universe shortly after the Big Bang. (Milton\u2019s God does not create the world ex nihilo.)\nMilton was interested in the science of his time. \u201cWhat if the sun / Be Centre to the world,\u201d the narrator famously asks in Book Eight. Let God worry about all that, is the thrust of the response. Scientific reasoning is ultimately marginal to the big story.\nMilton\u2019s cosmos is a visionary unfolding and enfolding of the biblical map with others from his vast mental bookstore. Paradise Lost itself is a densely intertextual amalgam of fictional worlds, made newly brilliant by the imagination behind the poet\u2019s now sightless eyes, embodied in blank verse at its most vigorously muscled \u2013 \u201cEnglish Heroic Verse \u2026 without Rime \u2026 the invention of a barbarous age,\u201d as the author robustly proclaimed. That verse flows, twists, ripples and thunders like a team of miraculously tireless and synchronised horses.

Bohemian Rhapsody wins big at \u2018questionable\u2019 Golden Globes\nGood morning, happy new year \u2013 and welcome back to the daily briefing. I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential news and features from the US and beyond.\nDonald Trump has said he is prepared to declare a national emergency over immigration in the \u201cnext few days\u201d to bypass Congress and build his coveted wall on the US border with Mexico. As the partial government shutdown enters its third week, triggered by the president\u2019s demands for $5.6bn to fund the wall, there has reportedly been little progress in negotiations between the White House and House Democrats, who have staunchly refused to pass a spending bill that includes wall funding.\nUnilateral action. The president can take unilateral action in times of crisis. But under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, Congress retains the power to contest such attempts.\nAgainst the wall. Trump said the 800,000 federal staff furloughed or forced to work without pay during the shutdown \u201cwant to see the border taken care of\u201d, despite public polling showing a majority of Americans oppose the wall.\nDonald Trump Jr and his father\u2019s longtime political adviser, Roger Stone, are both at heightened risk of perjury charges, with newly empowered congressional Democrats preparing to hand over evidence to Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, which could show the two men lied to Congress during closed-door interviews with the House\u2019s intelligence committee. The committee has interviewed dozens of witnesses for its own investigation, including Trump Jr, Stone, Jared Kushner and Michael Cohen.\nCohen. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer has already pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to Congress over attempts to reach a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.\nAdam Schiff. The incoming Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee could ultimately pose a greater threat to the president than Mueller, reports Tom McCarthy.\nTrump\u2019s shock announcement the US would pull its 2,000 remaining troops out of Syria led to the resignation of his defense secretary, James Mattis, last month. Now the US national security adviser, John Bolton, has rowed back on the withdrawal plan, insisting the US will only leave Syria once Isis has been conclusively defeated and America\u2019s Kurdish allies protected \u2013 conditions that could take years to achieve.\nNow or never? Trump claimed in December that Isis was beaten and US troops were \u201call coming back, and they\u2019re coming back now\u201d. On Sunday, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be removing our troops. I never said we\u2019re doing it that quickly.\u201d\nThe Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and the racially charged road trip comedy Green Book unexpectedly scooped the top film awards at the Golden Globes in LA on Sunday, winning drama and comedy respectively. The results \u2013 which some critics have called \u201cquestionable\u201d in the TV and film categories alike \u2013 have upended an awards season in which more critically adored films, such as A Star is Born, were expected to triumph. Some categories did follow the form book, with Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma winning best foreign film and Cuar\u00f3n himself named best director.\nOscar race. The battle for best actress now seems likely to be between Olivia Colman (The Favourite) and Glenn Close (The Wife), who won Globes in the comedy and drama categories respectively.\nBreaking ground. Sandra Oh became not only the first person of Asian heritage to host the Globes, but also the first woman of Asian heritage to win multiple Globes, taking a prize for her role in Killing Eve.\nAsian shares rose early on Monday as US and Chinese officials resumed talks in China amid hopes of resolving the ongoing trade confrontation between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nSoldiers in Gabon attempted a coup to overthrow the west African nation\u2019s president, Ali Bongo, who is recovering from a stroke. Soldiers appeared on state television saying they had seized control of the government \u201cto restore democracy\u201d but have since been detained.\nA 20-year-old Houston man, Eric Black Jr, has been charged with the murder of Jazmine Barnes, the seven-year-old girl who was killed when a man fired into her family\u2019s car last weekend.\nThe Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has broken the record for the most retweeted message in Twitter history after offering \u201cone million yen ($9,200) in cash to 100 people\u201d who shared a tweet about his fashion retailer\u2019s recent sales figures.\nThe disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield has returned to prominence, buoyed by vaccine scepticism among rightwing populists. After a spate of measles outbreaks across the EU, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, explains how Wakefield dented faith in the MMR vaccine.\nHow Bird Box became Netflix\u2019s biggest hit\nCritics saw the Netflix horror thriller Bird Box, starring Sandra Bullock, as a retread of the \u201cmore deft and terrifying\u201d A Quiet Place, released earlier in 2018. However, viewers have made it Netflix\u2019s most successful original feature to date, not to mention, a meme magnet, writes Benjamin Lee.\nBaghdad dreams of stability as it nears megacity status\nThe Iraqi capital remains a profoundly damaged city, but as its population nears 10 million and it prepares to join the ranks of the world\u2019s megacities, Baghdad is beginning to feel more stable, and even vibrant, reports Peter Beaumont.\nThe problem with the keto diet\nHigh on fat, low on carbs, the ketogenic diet flies in the face of conventional nutritional advice, yet it is fast becoming the most popular diet fad on the planet.

        "content": "Finborough, LondonCh\u00e9 Walker\u2019s enigmatic drama, set in Los Angeles, is the theatrical equivalent of film noir\nWritten and directed by Ch\u00e9 Walker, this play brings a touch of unexpected glamour to a tiny Earl\u2019s Court theatre. It is set in Los Angeles where it was originally performed, stars Girl from the North Country\u2019s Sheila Atim \u2013 who also composed the atmospheric score \u2013 and makes extensive use of video and dance. Yet, for all its high production values, I found it as puzzlingly enigmatic as its bilingual title suggests.\nThe plot is as convoluted as The Big Sleep, and there are times when Walker\u2019s dialogue seems to be paying direct homage to Chandler: at one point Atim as a sophisticated lapdancer called Rosa laconically tells a cop: \u201cYou know your way round a woman and you have good hygiene.\u201d The essential story, however, is one of betrayal. Blaz, a petty hood in the barrio, takes the rap for a hold-up when his partner-in-crime, Karl, flees the scene.\nWhile Blaz is doing three years in jail, his lover, Havana, has a fling with the detective who has put him behind bars. On emerging from the slammer, Blaz instinctively seeks revenge on those who have done him wrong.\nWalker has been quoted as saying he was inspired by the idea of \u201cwhat if Desdemona was actually cheating\u201d and the echoes of Othello are loud and insistent. Karl becomes an Iago-like plotter besotted by Blaz and informing him, \u201cI know you longer than your woman know you.\u201d Atim, who played Emilia last year in Othello at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, here fulfils a faintly similar role in that she acts as Havana\u2019s counsellor when she is accused of infidelity. In addition to Shakespeare, the piece is also studded with references to films and plays ranging from Nosferatu to Mrs Warren\u2019s Profession.\nBut I found myself constantly wondering what Walker was driving at. Is he suggesting, like Bacon, that there is a \u201cwild justice\u201d in revenge, that love is inseparable from treachery or that Los Angeles is the last refuge of the lonely? All those ideas surface but none of them is strong enough to hold the story together.\nWhat we get is the theatrical equivalent of film noir. Atim\u2019s music has a nerve-jangling quality. The sex, especially between Havana and the cop, is upfront and is represented both by cinematic coupling and choreographed movement. The threat of violence is also ever-present. The cast, most of whom switch between English and Spanish, perform with great precision. Atim is always hypnotic as a denizen of smoky nightclubs searching for romantic love. Gabriel Akuwudike invests Blaz with a baffled menace, Jessica Ledon hints that Havana, however unfaithful, is good at heart, and Benjamin Cawley leaves us in no doubt that the conniving Karl is in love with Blaz whom he incites to violence.\nThe strangest role, however, is that of a sex worker named Serena who acts as a chorus. Played with dash and spirit by Sasha Frost, she is given to recurring dreams about pterodactyls flying over Los Angeles, which seems a rather desperate attempt by Walker to lend mystery to a city that was once said to have \u201cthe personality of a paper cup\u201d. Like much else in Walker\u2019s baroque play, it doesn\u2019t really add up, yet I found myself succumbing to the filmic verve of his production.\nAt the Finborough, London, until 26 January.",

        "content": "The aromas evoke a childhood growing up in Lancashire, but here the traditional meat and tatty pie is given a Sicilian twist\nWe still don\u2019t have an oven in our new flat. Things that require one need carrying down a flight of stairs, across the internal courtyard and up two flights to my friend\u2019s studio. She\u2019s often away, so I let myself in, put whatever it is in the oven, set the timer on my phone and go home. When my pocket rings, I run back over. Our courtyard is not unused to cooking smells \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s a vortex of them, the ovens and vents of a ground-floor bakery, trattoria, bar and canteen-like tavola calda competing for air. There are also the 64 kitchens in 64 flats over five floors that open on to the courtyard, including my friend\u2019s studio. By the time I get to the courtyard, I have an absolute noseful.\nBut today it was meat and potato pie. The smell of beef, onions and potato, a thick, purposeful and savoury scent of meat steaming and braising underneath a pie crust, and the smell of pastry itself, made me stop and catch my breath. In that hot scent were Yorkshire and Lancashire market stalls; my gentle grandparents and the oval meat and tatty pies that warmed our hands but gave us heartburn; their house, which always seemed to smell of worry, meat and potatoes; and, of course, Granny\u2019s pub, and the endless meat and tatty pies eaten there. Then, as I ascended the stairs, the smell was also of Sicily, the wedges of olive-oil pastry torta we eat there in bars with strip lighting and curtains of lotto tickets.\nThe odd combination of Sicilian and Lancashire aromas came about because I was trying a classic meat-and-potato filling in an Italian olive-oil crust, which some might say is sacrilege, but seemed a good pastry-filling match, especially for an Englishwoman with Lancastrian roots who lives with a Sicilian.\nThis pastry is a good match for a meat and potato filling, because it stretches and can be twisted closed, making for a sturdy and functional pie. Alternatively, there is classic lard dough, which is tender and softly flaky.\nOf all the pies, meat and tatty is the best and most complete, I think: substance, softness and a starchy, enveloping gravy. The pleasure of pie is the same as the pleasure of a good short story \u2013 an enticing beginning (top), a fully flavoured middle and a satisfying end (base). I always wish for mashed potato with pies, except for meat and potato pie, when I wish for peas. I didn\u2019t have any, so in their absence I had bread, butter and pickles \u2013 crisp, sweet and sharp \u2013 which provided a good alternative to accompany a pie I have carried through my life, across a courtyard and up a flight of stairs.\nChoose between the lard and the olive oil pastries.\nFor the lard pastry150g lard, diced and frozen for 10 minutes250g plain flour\n  Salt\n  3\u20134 tbsp iced water\nFor the olive-oil pastry450g plain flour\n  Salt\n  2 tbsp olive oil\n  About 200ml water, at room temperature\nFor the filling400g stewing steak, diced to 2.5cm cubes100g kidneys (optional)200g onion, diced250g potato, diced1 heaped tbsp plain flour\n  Salt and black pepper\n  75ml cold water\n  Milk, for brushing\nTo make the lard pastry, rub the lard into the flour and salt until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs, then add just enough iced water to bring everything together into a dough ball. Knead briefly, wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.\nAlternatively, to make the olive-oil pastry, put the flour and salt in a large bowl, add the oil and enough warm water to make a soft, putty-like dough, knead for one minute, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes.\nPut the meat, potatoes, onion and flour in a bowl, season generously with salt and pepper and toss well with your hands. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and pop in a baking tray.\nRoll two-thirds of the dough into a disc large enough to line \u2013 and overhang \u2013 a 20cm wide x 4cm deep, ideally loose-bottomed, pie tin. Pile the filling into the pie, carefully pour over the water, brush the edges with milk. Roll out the final third of the pastry into a disc wide enough to cover the top, roll it over the filling, and pinch or twist the edges together carefully. Make two slits in the top of the pie.\nPut on the preheated baking tray and bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3, and bake for another hour for the lard pastry (cover it with foil if it looks to be browning too quickly), and a little more than an hour for the olive-oil pastry.\nLet the pie sit for 15 minutes, then serve with peas or pickles.",

        "content": "Arsenal are back on top of the table but victory over West Ham papered over defensive issues while Chelsea are back in form\nArsenal shot back to the top of the league with a 4-2 win over West Ham, but this was a far from perfect performance. The teams went into half-time at 2-2, and the leaders were then given what their usually mild-mannered manager, Joe Montemurro, described as their biggest telling-off of the season. He spent much of the last two weeks training against long balls and set pieces, only to watch his side twice fail to deal with long kicks from the West Ham goalkeeper, Becky Spencer, which released the Swiss forward Alisha Lehmann to set up Scotland\u2019s Jane Ross for two sublime finishes. Arsenal have strengthened their defence with the Danish international Janni Arnth, who scored the side\u2019s second goal on her debut, but despite conceding only nine goals in their 11 WSL games there is work to do at the back.\n Match report: West Ham 2-4 Arsenal\nWest Ham have also been active in the transfer window, bringing in the 30-year-old South Korean midfielder Cho So-hyun and the 26-year-old Canadian forward Adriana Leon. These show the club\u2019s ambition \u2013 of the other WSL teams only Arsenal and Chelsea have made moves so far this January window. West Ham know they can attract players from around the world because of the appeal of living in London, but to make it happen involves a significant commitment in terms of wages and accommodation. West Ham are at the same stage Manchester City were seven years ago: in their first fully professional season, a spine of experienced players they have brought in complement their own young players, and they are now strategically adding others to improve the squad. They play their home games at the club\u2019s training ground, and I\u2019ve been impressed with the set-up there. They\u2019re sixth at the moment, and will be looking to push on next season.\nAfter a slow start to the season Chelsea have gained momentum, and have won six of their seven WSL matches since being thrashed 5-0 by Arsenal in October. In all competitions they\u2019ve won 10 of their last 11 and drawn the other. In their 3-0 win against Everton Beth England, Drew Spence and Hannah Blundell were on the scoresheet, and it looks like the movement and link-up play that so efficiently sliced opposition defences apart last season has clicked back into gear. This week Chelsea signed Birmingham\u2019s Ann-Katrin Berger, probably the best goalkeeper in the division, and they now have three senior international goalkeepers who will all hope to be their country\u2019s first choice at this summer\u2019s World Cup \u2013 Sweden\u2019s Hedvig Lindahl, who started on Sunday, England\u2019s Carly Telford and Berger, a German international. The move for Berger might have been motivated by a desire to stop Arsenal getting her, but surely one of their keepers will now leave this month. Meanwhile Everton are still adapting to Willie Kirk, appointed as manager at the start of last month, but bottom club Yeovil\u2019s form is so poor that, with five points, they are only a win away from safety.\nMake that \u270c\ufe0f for @ChelseaFCW!@karenjcarney swings in a corner for @23Spence who makes no mistake \ud83d\udd35#FAWSL pic.twitter.com/i2vlmtIh9p\nBirmingham might not be able to rely on Berger anymore, but they were still their same old selves against Reading, coming away with a 2-1 victory thanks to Meaghan Sargeant\u2019s 89th-minute winner. Birmingham remain difficult to break down and tend to score scrappy or unspectacular goals to hold on for victory. This was a big win for them: had they lost Reading would have been a point behind them, but now they are fourth with a seven-point cushion. They need to stabilise after Berger\u2019s departure \u2013 they can perhaps cope with losing one key player, but cannot start haemorrhaging important team-members. If they were to lose even one more, or perhaps their manager, things could unravel quickly \u2013 and the job Marc Skinner has done in the Midlands could see other clubs, perhaps in America, take an interest in him. Something like the exodus from Liverpool at the end of last season is the nightmare scenario: they need to keep things tight over the next few weeks.\nManchester City\u2019s run of four successive WSL wins \u2013 with Arsenal among the scalps \u2013 and their leadership of the league came to a frustrating end with a 1-1 draw at Bristol City. Nick Cushing\u2019s side had 22 shots to Bristol\u2019s three, 10 corners to Bristol\u2019s 1, and 69% of possession, but Lucy Graham\u2019s second-half penalty denied them victory. This must have been horribly frustrating for Manchester City, who in their home game against the same opponents in September had an incredible 34 shots (to Bristol\u2019s 7), 19 corners (to zero) and 76% of possession, but not only did they fail to win that one, they needed a last-minute goal from Steph Houghton to even get a point. For all Bristol\u2019s resolute defendingon Sunday the visitors were sloppy at both ends of the pitch, and a lax pass inside their own box led to the concession of the penalty. They are two points behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand, and can\u2019t let that kind of wastefulness become a habit.\nPrepare to be amazed.How have @ManCityWomen not scored their second against Bristol City here? \ud83d\ude33#FAWSL pic.twitter.com/KSiOKtdXsE\nBT Sport has coverage of women\u2019s football all season.

        "content": "\u201cEverything I did in life, until now, was just for tennis. Nothing else mattered. That\u2019s why it became too much, maybe. That\u2019s why I suffered,\u201d Simona Halep says intently on a midwinter afternoon in Bucharest. We sit in a corner of a restaurant where the clinking of cutlery provides a refined backdrop to the raw immediacy of a rare interview with the world No 1.\nThere is snow on the ground outside but only warmth from Halep. Beyond her burning intensity she smiles with relief. \u201cThere is no pressure now. I feel lighter. I feel better. I wouldn\u2019t have been this relaxed if I hadn\u2019t won the French Open. A big weight is off my shoulders.\u201d\nThe 27-year-old has avoided opening up before because, apart from her shy and private nature, she was consumed by a fixation that was finally quenched in Paris last summer when winning her first grand slam. Halep can now offer insight into her life in Bucharest.\nWe meet at 9am and she chats cheerfully while we are driven to an indoor court on the outskirts of the city. I watch her practise for the Australian Open, which begins next week in the contrasting furnace of Melbourne, where Halep suffered so much last year. On the way to lunch, with Halep drained after playing hard for two hours, she finds pleasure in the simple fact she spent her first Christmas at home in 10 years.\n\u201cI dedicated myself 100%, so many years,\u201d Halep says. \u201cNow I\u2019ve won a grand slam and I start to enjoy life more. I like to go out, make friendships. I\u2019m more open. Before I won the French I was very focused.\u201d\nHalep now appears the opposite of a one-dimensional obsessive. Instead, as she reflects on the dedication needed to reach her goals, she talks expansively about physical trauma, psychological barriers, the role of her former coach Darren Cahill and the sweetness of victory.\nCahill will spend most of this year with his family in Australia and so Halep is currently without a coach. This unusual situation adds to the fascination as to whether, while returning from a back injury and exhaustion after her momentous 2018, she can become an even better player.\n\u201cI have the experience and that\u2019s why I decided to be alone for four months without a coach. I want to feel relaxed. I had a lot of pressure [last] year, from Romania, from the people around me, because everyone was talking about the grand slam title. It\u2019s just a sport but for me it was everything. That\u2019s why I suffered a little.\u201d\nHalep\u2019s psychological resolve has been tested but at last year\u2019s Australian Open she was subjected to a physical battering that meant she was taken to hospital after her draining three-set defeat in the final against Caroline Wozniacki. The entire tournament had been an ordeal. \u201cI have never played such a tough tournament and I hope I will not have to again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a disaster. My mum was scared and she said I must never do that again because it was too much. It was a warning.\u201d\nShe had twisted her ankle badly in the first round but struggled on to win that match and the next one before facing Lauren Davis. They played for three hours 45 minutes in searing heat, costing Davis some of her toenails, before Halep won 15-13 in the final set. \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d Halep says. \u201cShe played so well and had three match points. But I think I had more desire to win. That match meant a lot because mentally I was strong. I could stay so many hours on court.\u201d\nHalep survived another epic in the semi-finals, saving two match points and beating Angelique Kerber 9-7 in the third set, where \u201cit felt like every point was 20 rallies because she\u2019s a very big fighter. I was proud of that tournament. I was not even upset after I lost to Caroline in the final. I gave everything. But there was no more energy at the end.\n\u201cAfter the final, we finished with the press around 10pm and they took me to doping control. At 2am I left because I couldn\u2019t [produce a urine sample] as I was dehydrated. They took my blood. At the hotel I started shaking and they got me to hospital. My mother was worried and said if she was in my place she would stop and just enjoy life. It was really bad for three months. I was exhausted and couldn\u2019t recover totally. But I am proud I played at my limit.\u201d\nJust over four months later, in Paris, she was tested mentally rather than just physically. A fourth successive defeat in a major final would have felt ruinous \u2013 especially as Halep had lost the French Open the previous year when a set and 3-0 up in the final against Jelena Ostapenko. \u201cI have the courage to say I lost that final,\u201d she says. \u201cShe won it in the end because she was great and when you are young you just play. I lost it because I couldn\u2019t handle the emotions. For the next three months, I cannot use the word \u2018depressed\u2019 because it\u2019s too much, but I was sad for a long time.\u201d\nIn the 2018 French Open final, Halep was a set and 2-0 down to an inspired Sloane Stephens. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to play so well on clay so I thought everything will be lost again,\u201d she says. \u201cI said I have to try something so I was more aggressive. I went to the net three times in one game, which I never do. I won the game and I had the confidence because I thought about the year before when I was leading and lost it. I really believed then.\u201d\nHalep\u2019s face lights up as she remembers how 20 years of grinding work had finally given her the ultimate happiness she craved on court. \u201cEverything I had dreamed was real in that moment. All the people I love were there and when I lift the trophy, and the national song is played, it was the best moment I ever had. I was crying because it was huge. Maybe it will be my best moment as an athlete. But let\u2019s see. Maybe the future will give me even more.\u201d\nThat future is made intriguing by Halep\u2019s decision not to replace Cahill immediately. In explaining how much he helped her overcome mentally, Halep suggests her personal challenge is shared by many Romanians. \u201cPeople here don\u2019t believe in themselves much. We are very talented but we don\u2019t have confidence. I was lucky. Darren is Australian and totally different. He pushed me to be positive. I changed a lot.\u201d\nCahill took drastic action in March 2017 when, after she lost in Miami to Johanna Konta, he walked out because Halep was too negative. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Halep says. \u201cDarren was really upset. He said that if I don\u2019t want to change it means I don\u2019t want to be the best. After a few days I started to work with a psychologist. This lady [Alexis Castorri] helped me understand myself and to work on my weaknesses. Darren was really proud and so we started to work together again because he really thought I want to be the best.\u201d\nCan she succeed without a coach? \u201cNo, I need to find a coach. At this level it is impossible to go alone.\u201d Will she and Cahill be reunited? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can say I hope so because he\u2019s a great person and that matters the most.\u201d\nHalep is as brave as she is honest and, in addressing all she gave up for tennis, she explains how she chose to undergo breast reduction surgery when she was 18. Did she feel scared? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cMy family was scared. I was not scared because I knew I have to do it for tennis. My dream was just to be the best. So I was laughing when I went to the doctor. Afterwards, I was so much lighter and all my back problems were gone. So it was the best decision. I was dedicated 100% and did everything for tennis.\u201d\nHer rise is remarkable because, apart from her Romanian background giving her few advantages, Halep\u2019s character was perhaps not one of a typical sportsperson. \u201cSometimes I was crying that I don\u2019t want to go on the court because I was too shy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was very introverted. I am still an introvert.\u201d\nHalep smiles when I say she has been confident and revealing in this interview. \u201cI am open now. I improved a lot and I can be more natural.\u201d\nShe has begun to support young Romanian players hoping to make it on the pro circuit. \u201cI received a lot from tennis so it\u2019s good to help others because it\u2019s very difficult. Many talented kids get lost because they don\u2019t have the money. Tennis is an expensive sport in Romania.\u201d\nHalep also supports a girls\u2019 ice hockey team. \u201cI am paying for everything they need \u2013 equipment, coaches, some tournaments outside of Romania. They started to beat the boys so it\u2019s good. Sometimes I go see them for the energy and to get motivated.\u201d\nShe is also motivated by her own \u201cnew goals. A new way. Of course I\u2019m not like some players who won 10 or even 20 grand slams. But coming from Constanta [her home city], from nowhere, and becoming the best, is pretty huge for a Romanian, and for me as a person.\n\u201cNow I would love to be better in Fed Cup, to dream of the title, and the Olympics in 2020. I also want to win a grand slam again, to finish No 1 again. But I won\u2019t put pressure on myself. I will have few more years of tennis and then I want to improve in other ways. In 10 years I would love to have three kids, a beautiful family and be out of tennis \u2013 knowing I gave it everything.\u201d",

        "content": "May says plan setting out \u00a320.5bn budget increase guarantees health service\u2019s future\nTheresa May has said the government\u2019s long-term plan for the NHS in England will secure its future for generations to come, as critics claimed the proposals were undeliverable in the light of a big staffing shortfall.\nLaunching the long-awaited 10-year blueprint at Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital, in Liverpool, on Monday, which will set out how the NHS in England will spend the \u00a320.5bn budget increase the prime minister has promised, May said taking a long-term view would transform healthcare.\nMany of the details, including developments in genomics, hi-tech surgery and artificial intelligence to help save hundreds of thousands more lives, had been trailed in advance. May used her speech instead to portray the overall package of measures as a gamechanger for the health service.\n\u201cWe are taking a big step to secure the future of the NHS for our children and their children,\u201d she said. \u201cDelivered effectively, our long-term plan for the NHS will secure the health service for generations to come \u2026 This is a historic moment. Our vision is clear, our commitment is assured, so let\u2019s deliver the NHS of the future.\u201d\nThe prime minister said she had made the NHS her No 1 priority as this was what the public wanted. Speaking before May, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said the plan was ambitious.\nHe said some of the changes would be implemented quickly, including new genetic tests for children with cancer this year, appointments to see GPs online, radical reforms to reduce 30m outpatient appointments, and guaranteed support for older people at home and in the community.\nIn the longer term, the plan envisages halving maternity-related deaths by 2025, tackling health inequalities and increasing the proportion of people getting an early cancer diagnosis, increasing their survival prospects, from a half to three-quarters over the next decade. Stevens said the measures, which would also target other major killers such as stroke and heart attacks, would create an \u201cNHS fit for the future for the next decade\u201d.\nHe said previously neglected areas such as mental health, learning disabilities and autism would also be addressed, \u201cservices that for too long have been squeezed from the national debate and unsupported by the NHS\u201d.\nWhile its vision has been broadly welcomed, questions have been asked about how the plan will be delivered, particularly in the light of the ongoing staffing crisis.\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cThis plan cannot be delivered whilst trusts still have 100,000 workforce vacancies. We need urgent action to solve what trust leaders currently describe as their biggest problem. It\u2019s a major concern that we will have to wait longer to get the comprehensive plan that is needed here.\u201d\nHis comments were echoed by Richard Murray, the chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund, who said a number of questions remained unanswered. \u201cWhile NHS leaders have done what was asked of them within the constraints of the funding settlement provided by the government, some significant pieces of the jigsaw are still missing. A number of decisions \u2013 notably on hospital waiting times \u2013 have been postponed, indicating that trade-offs and difficult choices lie ahead.\n\u201cWhether the plan can be delivered relies critically on tackling workforce shortages. While the plan recognises this, commitments to increase international recruitment depend on decisions about immigration policy and we will need to wait for solutions until a new workforce plan is published later this year.\u201d\nBoth May and Stevens were at pains to stress that staff were at the heart of the plan. Stevens said the majority of the \u00a320.5bn pledged by the government for the first five years of the plan would be spent on current and future staffing.\nThe prime minister repeated her disputed claim that the \u00a320.5bn cash injection had been made possible partly because of the \u201cvast amounts\u201d that would be saved by Britain leaving the EU.",

        "content": "Group of soldiers had called on people to \u2018rise up\u2019 while ailing president is out of country\nThe Gabonese government has put down a coup attempt after a group of soldiers briefly took over state radio and broadcast a statement calling on people to \u201crise up\u201d while the president, Ali Bongo, is in Morocco recovering from a stroke.\nAuthorities have regained control of the state broadcasting offices and a major thoroughfare in the capital, Libreville, which were the only areas taken by the plotters, the government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou told Radio France International.\nAt 4.30am (0530 GMT) on Monday a man identifying himself as Lt Kelly Ondo Obiang read out a message on state radio that was simultaneously filmed for social media.\nObiang was flanked by two armed men, all in the uniform and green berets of the powerful Republican Guard, which is usually tasked with protecting the president.\n\u201cThe eagerly awaited day has arrived when the army has decided to put itself on the side of the people in order to save Gabon from chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up. Wake up your neighbours \u2026 rise up as one and take control of the street,\u201d he added, calling on Gabonese to occupy the country\u2019s airports, public buildings and media organisations.\nA witness told Reuters a crowd of about 300 people had gathered in support of the attempted coup at the state broadcasting headquarters, where the military fired teargas to disperse them.\nThe Bongo family has ruled Gabon since 1967, except for four months in 2009 after Ali Bongo\u2019s father, Omar, died.\nFour of the five plotters were taken into custody on Monday morning, Mapangou told France 24. The fifth was caught in the afternoon, reportedly hiding under a bed in a house. \u201cThe government is in place. The institutions are in place,\u201d Mapangou said. The communications minister said the men were \u201ca group of jokers and the military hierarchy does not recognise them\u201d.\nMoussa Faki Mahamat, the chair of the African Union, said he strongly condemned the coup attempt. A spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry also criticised the action in its former colony. \u201cGabon\u2019s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,\u201d she said.\nBongo became ill in October while on a visit to Saudi Arabia. Rather than going home, he went to recuperate in Morocco, from where he gave a New Year\u2019s Day statement in which he admitted he had been \u201cthrough a difficult period, as sometimes happens in life\u201d. He said he was preparing to return home soon.\nObiang said Bongo\u2019s speech, in which he slurred some words and appeared unable to move his right arm, had \u201creinforced doubts about the president\u2019s ability to continue to carry out the responsibilities of his office\u201d.\nOmar Bongo squandered much of Gabon\u2019s vast oil wealth and kept close ties with France in a system known as Fran\u00e7afrique. Ali Bongo tried to set himself apart from his father but lost any moral high ground at the last presidential vote.\nHe was the beneficiary of an election in 2016 that was widely acknowledged to have been rigged amid violence from the country\u2019s security forces. Ostensibly he won 49.8% of the vote to his rival Jean Ping\u2019s 48.23%. Ping had looked set to win until results from Haut-Ogoou\u00e9, Bongo\u2019s home region, were announced. The electoral commission claimed a 99.98% turnout in Haut-Ogoou\u00e9, compared with 59% everywhere else, and said 95% of those who cast votes there did so for the president.\nThe opposition accused the Republican Guard of bombing its headquarters in the aftermath.\nOn Friday, Donald Trump sent 80 troops to Gabon to defend US interests and \u201cfurther foreign policy\u201d in the nearby Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the Catholic church has warned of an uprising if the result of an election on 30 December is not respected.",

        "content": "Despite extra funding, central idea of plan for NHS England is to do more with less\nThe NHS does not have enough money to keep doing what it does, treating the growing number of sick and often elderly people, many of whom live in the less well-off communities of the country. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens, last year played a brilliantly strategic Brexit card (citing referendum promises that EU money would go to the NHS instead) and managed to extract a tidy sum from the government to stop the gaps and improve its functioning \u2013 in comparison with what other departments are getting. But \u00a320.5bn by 2023-24 will not transform the creakingly overloaded health service. The Long-term plan, published on Monday, and part of a deal with the government to end the political clamour about the overloaded NHS, is about doing more with less.\nBy stopping people getting sick in the first place. The central thrust of the plan is to keep people well and to pick it up really early if they get ill, because it\u2019s far cheaper to treat cancer or heart disease before it\u2019s progressed. The focus has to be on primary care \u2013 picking up problems at the GP surgery \u2013 and supporting people to improve their own health, for instance, by stopping smoking or taking more exercise.\nIt\u2019s a big one \u2013 to save up to half a million lives. The subtext is that it will save the NHS a lot of money. The plan will \u201cprevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than 3 million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade\u201d.\nThere is excited talk of new technology. The NHS will open a digital \u201cfront door\u201d. Consulting a GP online will save her time and yours \u2013 and encourage more people with potential problems to get checked out. Stevens will be hoping it cuts the numbers heading for A&E because they can\u2019t immediately get to see a GP. Digital consultations, plus rethinking the support given to those arriving at A&E so they are channelled to the urgent care centre or somewhere more appropriate to their needs will save 30m trips to hospital and \u00a31bn, says the plan.\nThere will be genetic testing to find people at risk of dangerously high cholesterol levels that could lead to heart disease and strokes. Children will get access to mental health support in schools, in the hope of preventing depression and anxiety escalating into adulthood. Mental health issues will be investigated when people have physical health problems too. There will be a big emphasis on diagnostics and testing to pick up cancer early. Smart inhalers will be given to asthma patients.\nThe NHS is going to fund prevention programmes for obesity and smoking, and promote its already successful weight-loss support for people with type-2 diabetes. It\u2019s not the NHS\u2019s responsibility alone, it points out \u2013 but it interacts with 1 million people a day who are sick and may be at a moment in their lives when they will rethink what they are doing about their health. And they pick up the pieces. Obesity causes heart disease and cancers, as well as type-2 diabetes.\nNot at all. The NHS is being squeezed by the convergence of several intractable problems. Obesity, caused by poor diet and inactivity, is one of them. The growing numbers of frail and elderly people who are in and out of hospital \u2013 and can\u2019t be moved out because there is no social care package for them \u2013 is another.\nThat money is for the NHS. Local authorities have been crying in pain for some time, because they are responsible for public health programmes on obesity, smoking cessation and alcohol, as well as myriad other vital services and they are not getting enough cash. The NHS plan will help by its focus on supporting people at their GP practice and in their community to adopt healthier behaviour. Money from NHS England will be directed to areas on the basis of their local needs, in a bid to tackle health inequalities. The poorest in society are the sickest. But the NHS cannot sort this alone.\nThe other hugely difficult area is social care for the elderly. Everybody knows it is vital that it is sorted out and it will take a lot of money. The NHS is in jeopardy until that happens.\nIt\u2019s much more than that. Stevens is attempting a gradual transformation of the NHS \u2013 a tightening up and smartening up. New ideas have been trialled in a few areas of the country as \u201cvanguard\u201d projects and those that work are extended. He wants to dump the Lansley free market reforms. The plan calls for legislation to \u201ccreate publicly accountable integrated care locally; to streamline the national administrative structures of the NHS; and remove the overly rigid competition and procurement regime applied to the NHS\u201d, it says.\nBut the biggest problem, worsened by Brexit, will be staffing. The plan talks of taking the pressure off staff in A&E and hospitals generally. Online consultations will be expected to help GPs, too. But there will still be rising numbers of elderly people and a need for treatment, which is costly and really requires an expanding workforce. The nursing shortage, especially, will bite and the plan proposes support to train more. But the workforce issues are unlikely to go away.",

But since they established Baroque at the Edge, they deal with musicians who bring electronics, prepared pianos, folk instruments and more into the mix.\nThis weekend-long festival mines a fertile seam, inviting experimentally minded performers to take 17th- or 18th-century music and run with it into the present day. For some this is their stock in trade. Viol player Liam Byrne has inspired many new works for his old instrument; spotlit next to his laptop in LSO St Luke\u2019s, he showcased several in his afternoon concert. Composers included Nico Muhly, Edmund Finnis, Alex Mills, whose Suspensions and Solutions created hulks of sound through different reverb processes, and Samuel Milea, whose Unvoiced examines dementia in the way its phrases move in and out of lucidity. Byrne is an unassuming performer but his glee in the sonic potential of his instrument is infectious; he was mesmerising building up a Tudor consort work line by line, the music changing shape with each addition. His unamplified playing was just as spellbinding, especially in his encore, a gorgeous Vivace by Karl Friedrich Abel.\nElicia Silverstein\u2019s earlier concert, in the ringing acoustic of St James, Clerkenwell, tapped the affinities between monsters of the baroque and modern repertoire for solo violin. As well as thoughtful Bach, there was a tautly plotted performance of Biber\u2019s huge \u201cGuardian Angel\u201d Passacaglia, and Sciarrino\u2019s gauzy, scurrying Caprice No 2. Capping everything was Berio\u2019s colossal Sequenza No 8, in which Silverstein\u2019s control of the two distinct lines made it seem we were listening to two violinists.\nBack in St Luke\u2019s in the late-night slot, soprano Nora Fischer sang baroque and Renaissance laments by Monteverdi, Purcell, Barbara Strozzi and others. Sometimes she performs these with electric guitar; here, however, her partner was theorbo player Mike Fentross, and together they performed with an immediacy and cheerful disregard for convention that seemed to sum up the ethos of a little festival buzzing with ideas.",

        "content": "Eden Hazard has called on Chelsea and Tottenham supporters to show each other mutual respect ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, with police set to be out in force at Wembley in an attempt to act on any incidents of antisemitic chanting.\nIn the week that the World Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned Spurs fans\u2019 use of the nickname \u201cYids\u201d and called for them to take a stand against using the term during matches, the two clubs have been working with the Metropolitan Police to crack down on any potential trouble. With 5,000 expected to attend the match, Chelsea issued a strong warning to their supporters on Monday that they would take \u201cthe strongest possible action\u201d against anyone involved in racist chanting, while Hazard also admitted he would prefer if \u201cthose sort of fans\u201d just stayed away.\n\u201cDo I want the fans of both clubs to respect each other? Yes, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said before that these sort of fans are not fans for me. They come to the stadium just to say something. I understand people want the team they support to win but they need to show fair play, to just support their team.\u201d He added: \u201cI want people to remember the game for the right reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want all the fans to watch and enjoy the match. One team will win, one will lose, but try to act with fair play.\u201d\nMeanwhile Maurizio Sarri has admitted to underestimating the strength of feeling between Chelsea and Spurs with memories still very much vivid of the way Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s men took the Blues apart two months ago. Son Heung-min\u2019s second-half goal in the 3-1 victory, in which he left Jorginho for dead, was the abiding image of the game for many fans. For Sarri, however, it was the demeanour of his players as they sat despondent in the dressing room afterwards.\n\u201cAfter the match in the Premier League I realised the real situation,\u201d Sarri said of the nature of the rivalry. \u201cI saw my players in the dressing room afterwards. They were destroyed. So I realise that the match against Tottenham is very important for the club, the fans, but also for the players. So, of course, for me this match is now more important.\u201d\nSarri believes his squad have learned lessons from the November encounter, some of them tactical. But in a match where Spurs had less possession than the visitors but had nine shots on target to Chelsea\u2019s two, the Italian believes the key change his team must make in this week\u2019s fixture is to up their physical commitment.\n\u201cWe need to approach this match in another way because we lost [the last game] in the first 15 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were more aggressive than us, more determined than us. So now we know that, if the approach is the same [this time], there is no solution for us. I want to speak about this first. We need to talk about dedication first, otherwise to talk about tactics is useless. But I think we need to change tactics too.\u201d\nSarri had lots of kind words for his opposite number, Pochettino, but he was also willing to up the ante a little by concurring with the line of thought that says the Argentinian must win a trophy if he is to confirm his reputation as one of the leading managers in the game. Sarri also used Pochettino\u2019s longevity at Tottenham as a reminder for patience during his own first year in English football.\n\u201cHe is a very good coach,\u201d Sarri said, \u201cI think one of the best at the moment. I agree he has to win a trophy, though I hope not this one. I think it is the same for me. Of course Pochettino is in Spurs for four years and I am here for six months but I think here [in England] the first season is really very difficult. Pochettino has had four years, [J\u00fcrgen] Klopp four years, it was very hard in the first season for [Pep] Guardiola. Here it is really difficult to build an important team. You need time.\u201d",

Zs\u00f6g\u00f6n and his team are already working on the feat, and say they hope to have some news by the end of the year.\nZs\u00f6g\u00f6n added the endeavour was also about showing that genome engineering is a useful tool, and helping people to accept the technology.\n\u201cThere is the fun side \u2013 you just do it \u2026 because we can, basically \u2013 and there [are] the potentially interesting applications for agriculture,\u201d he said.\nZs\u00f6g\u00f6n said he was personally looking forward to hot tomatoes to make guacamole, but added that it might be best if the spicy produce did not end up at Spain\u2019s annual tomato-throwing competition. \u201cThere could be injuries,\u201d he said.",

Now scientists say they have worked out what is behind the gender imbalance: the females migrate further north than males.\nMagellanic penguins finish breeding in Patagonia in February, and during the subsequent winter months head north, reaching as far as Brazil, in search of anchovies. But every year thousands become stranded, with many airlifted to safety onboard military aircraft.\nWriting in the journal Current Biology, researchers in Japan and Argentina report how they attached tracking devices to eight male and six female penguins in 2017 and tracked where the birds went after they left the breeding grounds of Cabo dos Bah\u00eda in Argentina and began the migration north in April.\nPreviously it was unknown whether males and females took different paths or not.\n\u201cAlthough some assumptions are made, the exact reason for the female-biased stranding has been unknown due to the lack of information on their behaviour outside the breeding season, despite the growing focus on the conservation of this species,\u201d said Takashi Yamamoto, a co-author of the report from the Institute of Statistical Mathematics in Japan.\nThe results from the study offer a clearer picture. While the authors note that only a small number of penguins were tracked, the females generally travelled further north, with many reaching waters off the coast of Uruguay. The males, meanwhile, predominantly stuck to waters off the Argentinian coast. The study also found males typically dived deeper than females: about 59 metres compared with about 35 metres.\nThe authors offer a number of reasons why males and females may head to different areas \u2013 including to avoid competition for food \u2013 and why they dive to different depths \u2013 the females\u2019 smaller bodies may restrict the depths they can reach.\nThey also suggest the different sexes may seek waters of different temperatures, with the lighter females preferring warmer, shallower surroundings. The females may be more susceptible to being swept along on sea currents, they add.\nWhile researchers are still trying to understand why penguins end up stranded, Yamamoto and colleagues suggest those that end up further north may have used more energy swimming or catching dispersed prey, leaving them exhausted. Climate change, pollution in the area or injury from fishing equipment could also play a role. Reports of strandings have noted that many penguins are unwell or exhausted, with some also washing up dead.\n\u201cIn addition, plastic remains have been reported in the stomach of beach-washed Magellanic penguins,\u201d said Yamamoto, adding that a skewed sex ratio could potentially lead to a population decline.\nWhile the findings may not help prevent strandings, Yamamoto said it could help with conservation of the species in the face of growing human-generated hazards. \u201cIf we do not consider any conservation action, such as marine zoning, I expect that the number of stranding individuals will increase.\u201d",

That\u2019s not possible \u2026 too, too old.\u201d\nIn the interview with Marie-Claire magazine\u2019s French edition, Moix, the author of several prize-winning novels, added that women in their 50s were \u201cinvisible\u201d to him.\n\u201cI prefer younger women\u2019s bodies, that\u2019s all.

        "content": "Released on Bowie\u2019s birthday and narrated by Gary Oldman, the David Bowie Is ... app intends to bring you the gift of sound and vision \u2013 but falls a little short\nYou have to feel for anyone tasked with designing a David Bowie app, which launches on 8 January, his birthday, priced \u00a37.99. Given the guy was a shape-shifting pop genius who worked 10 steps ahead of his peers, transformed our cultural landscape and even turned his own death into a piece of art, you\u2019re probably not going to get away with throwing up a few annotated pictures. Bowie fans want something that lives up to the icon\u2019s name. No pressure.\nDavid Bowie Is \u2026 is an app based on the V&A\u2019s record-breaking 2013 exhibition of the same name, which toured the world before ending up at New York\u2019s Brooklyn Museum last year. The rather ambitious plan is not just to recreate the experience of going to the exhibition \u2013 which focused on the colourful, theatrical side of Bowie and drew a staggering 2m visitors \u2013 but to better it. As the creators put it, the app gains you access to all the exhibits: \u201cWithout the entire exhibition in the intimacy of your own environment, without glass barriers, vitrines or throngs of visitors.\u201d Who needs people when you\u2019ve got a smartphone?\nAs someone who will happily seize any excuse not to have to mingle with the public, I settled down on the Guardian sofas for a play around. The makers have gone for an augmented reality approach \u2013 \u201cstaging\u201d the exhibition in front of your camera viewer (that Guardian sofa gets quite psychedelic at times) and allowing you to navigate the items in three dimensions. You progress through the virtual museum\u2019s series of rooms that range from the obvious (\u201cEarly influences\u201d; \u201cLife on Mars\u201d etc) to the more esoteric (there\u2019s a good one on Kansai Yamamoto, the Japanese fashion designer who created costumes for Bowie\u2019s legendary Aladdin Sane tour). In each room, you\u2019ll find the exhibition\u2019s artefacts \u2013 lyric sheets, pop videos, various ephemera, not to mention a huge range of costumes \u2013 while Gary Oldman narrates.\nYou can see Bowie\u2019s early sketches proposing outfits for his teenage band the Delta Lemons (brown waistcoats with jeans), watch him perform in the short 1969 film The Mask (A Mime) and see the Warhol-esque lithograph he created of his wife Iman in 1994. In the Blackstar room, we hear him questioned on the subject of religion: \u201cDo you indulge in a form of worship?\u201d he\u2019s asked. \u201cLife,\u201d he answers. \u201cI love life very much indeed.\u201d\nI found the more obscure rooms the most fascinating. In the Yamamoto room I learn the roots of Bowie\u2019s love of \u201chikinuki\u201d \u2013 the Japanese method of quick costume change that he experimented with during his Aladdin Sane shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York. It was here, while performing half-a-dozen costume changes each night, that he received standing ovations and realised he was on to something. As Bowie himself puts it, he didn\u2019t want to be a radio, but a colour television.\nThe exhibition subscribes to this notion too, and is deep and rich \u2013 even after an hour or so messing around I\u2019d barely covered a third of it. It\u2019s great that you can zoom in on lyric sheets and rotate the outlandish costumes a full 360 degrees. But for all the \u201cbehind the glass\u201d hype, it\u2019s no match for seeing the costumes in real life \u2013 the renderings inevitably lose some of the character. Mingling with the public is unfortunately still the best way to experience this kind of thing.\nAs for the augmented reality interface \u2013 it\u2019s both impressive and frustrating. At times you wish it was simpler, as certain artefacts are hard to access and the screen positioning makes viewing them a disorientating experience. You can be forced to hold your phone at awkward angles to get the best view.\nIt\u2019s great that the app invites you to take your time, revisit at your leisure and to take lots of breaks \u2013 a welcome antidote to the hectic-pace of most pop culture consumption \u2013 but browsing through David Bowie Is \u2026 isn\u2019t always the most relaxing experience.\nStill, for the millions of fans who didn\u2019t get to see the exhibition, or even ones who did but spent most of it trying to crane their neck around someone else\u2019s shoulder, there\u2019s plenty of value to be had in this summation of an artist who was neither a radio nor a colour television but something far more advanced indeed.\nThe David Bowie Is \u2026 app is available for iOS and Android, priced \u00a37.99",

But it has attracted criticism for promoting laissez-faire, business-friendly policies that aim to boost private sector employment. Phillip Inman\nKim said: \u201cIt has been a great honour to serve as president of this remarkable institution, full of passionate individuals dedicated to the mission of ending extreme poverty in our lifetime.\n\u201cThe World Bank Group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity.\u201d\nHowever, in a letter to staff that is likely to be seen as veiled criticism of the organisation, the 59-year-old said: \u201cThe opportunity to join the private sector was unexpected, but I\u2019ve concluded that this is the path through which I will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change and the infrastructure deficit in emerging markets.\u201d\nOnly last month Kim said the organisation would make about $200bn (\u00a3157bn) available to fund action on climate change from 2021-25, helping countries adapt to the effects of warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nUS presidents have traditionally appointed the head of the World Bank, while European governments normally decide the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Barack Obama chose Kim in 2012 to fill the shoes of Robert Zoellick, a former US government official.\nKim\u2019s abrupt resignation leaves Donald Trump with the opportunity to appoint a successor. He could turn to Bulgarian national Kristalina Georgieva, the bank\u2019s chief executive, who will take over as interim president when Kim leaves. The much-respected official was a European commissioner and EU finance chief before moving to Washington.\nBefore Kim took over, the bank laid down criteria for appointing future presidents, which were designed to exclude officials with little experience of running large organisations or who lacked relevant experience, especially in the developing world.\nHowever, Trump is expected to use his effective power of veto to make sure a close adviser or a sympathetic political figure takes over.\nA senior official at an international charity, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was concerned that the World Bank\u2019s aid efforts could be badly affected if the appointment became a political football.\n\u201cIt is a US appointment that is not necessarily meritocratic. It is something that the Trump administration controls and that has to be a source of concern,\u201d he added.\nKim said his achievements included persuading countries on the governing council, including the US, to boost the bank\u2019s capital budget last year by a record $13bn. He said poverty around the world had fallen and the bank was on target to reach its goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.\nHowever, last year the bank was forced to admit that progress has slowed and efforts would need to be intensified to reach the goal. Poverty in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa also increased as aid efforts failed to cope with a dramatic increase in population across the region.\nMeanwhile, critics of the institution have pointed out that much of the reduction in global poverty levels over recent decades is largely down to domestic policies in communist China.\nCritics have also accused the bank of following a business-friendly agenda that allowed western companies to make profits from developing countries without paying a fair share in tax in those states.",

        "content": "BBC1\u2019s The Greatest Dancer and Channel 4\u2019s Flirty Dancing are going toe to toe for audiences. But can they fill Strictly\u2019s shoes?\nThe new year starts with two new dance shows to fill the Strictly gap: BBC1\u2019s talent contest The Greatest Dancer and, starting on Thursday, Channel 4\u2019s new dating show Flirty Dancing, in which Ashley Banjo choreographs dance routines for two strangers who meet for the first time on the dance floor to see if sparks fly.\n  Strictly has proven that dance can hold its own on primetime TV. Or has it? Clearly nobody involved in The Greatest Dancer believes that dance alone can keep our attention, hence the repeated cutaways to audience reactions, the backstories, the family members appealing for votes, the green room chats with the \u201creceptionist\u201d, the big reveal format where the studio mirror parts to reveal the audience. It\u2019s all a jumble of things familiar from other programmes. There\u2019s so much padding that dance barely gets a look-in.\n  But perhaps the producers know what they\u2019re doing. After all, a show that did focus more on dance, So You Think You Can Dance, which has been running for 15 seasons in the US, flopped after two series in the UK despite featuring some brilliant performers. Anyone who thought that TGD was going to really champion great dancers and introduce audiences to new styles of dance overlooked the fact that it\u2019s a Simon Cowell-created slice of Saturday night entertainment.\nThe great controversy of the opening episode was down to the fact that it\u2019s the audience and not the judges who vote the acts through to the next round, meaning that a gold-waistcoated uber-fan of Cheryl got through, perhaps because everyone wanted to see him meet his idol. While the Russian-trained ballet dancer Yassaui Mergaliyev, who reeled off barrel turns and pirouettes, did not. Mergaliyev may not have been the most charismatic dancer, but he was by far the most technically accomplished on the show.\nOn top of personalities and stories, it seems the public like acts that give a clear indication of how you\u2019re supposed to react to them. So the rather average \u201ccomic\u201d street dancers, or the gymnastically impressive girl doing the kind of emotive contemporary dance that you only ever see on TV (remember the \u201ccancer dance\u201d from SYTYCD?), get the vote because they\u2019re telling you how to respond, but an abstract ballet variation? Not everyone knows what to do with that.\nPart of the success of Strictly is down to the fact that it\u2019s not afraid of talking technically about dance. So as the series goes on, the audience learns about bevels and chass\u00e9s and heel leads as the celebs do. The more you watch, the more you get out of it, and you\u2019re not relying on cheap tricks or the tugging of heartstrings to keep your attention. Maybe we\u2019ll get some of that when \u201cdance captains\u201d Oti Mabuse, Matthew Morrison and Cheryl take over coaching their acts.\nAnd yet, sometimes technique is irrelevant. There\u2019s no doubt the highlight of the The Greatest Dancer was the final act. Andrew, a 21-year-old with Down\u2019s Syndrome, danced with so much joy that everyone was in tears (myself included) and it was a wonderful demonstration of what dance can do.\nFlirty Dancing is a wholly different show but it shares some of that joy of Andrew\u2019s dance. The first episode includes two guys bopping through an empty Tate Britain, bright eyed and grinning, and it\u2019s about amateurs having fun in a sweetly awkward shared endeavour. It\u2019s a show that\u2019s about that first moment of meeting someone, with no chat, just sensing them and reading their body language. For all the telly formatting and its contrived nature, Flirty Dancing is actually about something very pure: dance as wordless connection and communication, unmediated. And the programme trusts that dance can do that, in a way that The Greatest Dancer does not.",

Not all are marginal seat holders but were chosen by GetUp for what it considers \u201cout of date\u201d views on climate change, \u201cheartless positions\u201d on immigration policy and those who \u201cblatantly discriminate\u201d on social justice issues.\nThe results of the survey will be updated live on the website.\nGetUp has already committed to high-profile campaigns against MP Tony Abbott and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, but offers voters a host of other options in its \u201cLet\u2019s vote out the hard right\u201d campaign, which it considers an \u201cextension\u201d of its original campaign.\nGetUp\u2019s proposed targets include the attorney general, Christian Porter, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, as well as the influential conservative backbenchers George Christensen, Craig Kelly and Michael Sukkar.\nThe list of target MPs includes several in nominally safe Coalition seats including Kevin Andrews, who holds Menzies with a 10% margin, Barnaby Joyce, who holds New England on 23.4%, and even the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who is likely untouchable in Cook with a 15.4% buffer.\nAbbott, who holds Warringah with a margin of 11.6%, is under a concerted attack from grassroots organisers keen to capitalise on dissatisfaction about conservatives\u2019 role in bringing down Malcolm Turnbull.\nThe former prime minister is facing a challenge from the Indigenous broadcaster and mental health educator Susan Moylan-Coombs. The social commentator Jane Caro has also contemplated a run against Abbott.\nThe Coalition\u2019s disastrous Victorian state election result has convinced Labor that at least six more seats in Victoria are in play at the federal election. Sukkar\u2019s seat of Deakin (5.7%), Hunt\u2019s seat of Flinders (7.8%) and population minister Alan Tudge\u2019s seat of Aston (8.6%) are on GetUp\u2019s list and are considered in play despite healthy buffers.\nThe Australian has reported that even the deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, could lose his blue-ribbon seat of Kooyong, which he holds by 13.3%, because a union-backed poll found him trailing 48% to 52% in two-party preferred terms.\nGetUp has completed a survey of 23,000 of its members that found their top priorities for the 2019 election are: action on climate change and stopping the Adani coalmine, renewable energy, evacuation of people from offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru, social spending on health and education, and protecting the ABC and SBS.\nMembers placed less priority on: stopping tax evasion by corporations and high-income earners, a federal anti-corruption watchdog, raising income support for the unemployed, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander campaigns and defending multiculturalism.\nDespite being dwarfed by unions \u2013 collectively Australia\u2019s largest social movement with more than 1.8 million members \u2013 GetUp is an outsized irritant to conservative media and politicians, many of who believe the political right should emulate its organising tactics.\nThe campaign body has drawn the ire of the Coalition for its refusal to identify as an \u201cassociated entity\u201d of the opposition Labor and Greens parties, particularly after its decision in 2016 to hand out how-to-vote cards directing preferences away from the Liberal and National parties.\nGetUp\u2019s national director, Paul Oosting, said voters in targeted electorates could expect to see his organisation\u2019s members on the other end of their phone lines and at their doors, as well as witness to crowd funded advertising campaigns, with a focus on digital and social media.\n\u201cLed by our members we will be holding candidates to account on the key policy areas essential for Australia to be fair, flourishing and just,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cWe have a groundswell of enthusiasm and people everywhere are fed up with out-of-date politicians blocking meaningful action on the issues they care about.\n\u201cPeople are raring to go and to make a difference.\n\u201cThis election effort is going be huge, we already have thousands of hours committed by volunteers and are in awe of their dedication to have a lasting impact on election day.\u2019\u2019\nThe conservative side of politics has attempted to counter GetUp campaigns with its own centre-right campaign organisations, the latest incarnation being Advance Australia.

The coroner, Paul Bennett, said he came off medication that he had been taking for a number of years and James felt the new treatment was not as effective.\nOn 30 January 2015, James was involved in a car accident and the police were called. Officers took him to Bronglais hospital in Aberystwyth and he returned home from there.\nThe jury heard that in the early hours of 31 January, James became aggressive and assaulted his mother. James called the police and was arrested and taken to the police station. Later that morning, he was assessed by a medic who concluded he was fit to be detained.\nThe inquest heard that when officers went to James\u2019s cell at about 11am to check on him, he burst out of the cell and into the corridor.\nOfficers tried to restrain him and Pava spray was also used, the jury heard. James became unresponsive, and despite efforts to resuscitate him at the police station and at Withybush hospital in Haverfordwest, he was pronounced dead at 11.30am.\nThe inquest at Haverfordwest, which is due to last two weeks, will explore a wide range of issues, including:\nThe management of James by police officers on 30 January and their handover to staff at Bronglais hospital.\nThe treatment of James at Bronglais hospital.\nHis management at Haverfordwest police station on 31 January.\nThe restraint on 31 January 2015 and the emergency response thereafter.\nTraining of the police officers.\nBefore the start of the inquest, James\u2019s sister, Diana Vaughan-Thomas, said on behalf of the family: \u201cWe have had to wait four years for this inquest.

        "content": "Matteo Salvini and coalition partner Luigi Di Maio appear at odds as standoff continues\nA rift has opened within Italy\u2019s populist coalition government over the fate of 49 people who remain stranded at sea in the Mediterranean onboard two private rescue ships.\nThirty-two of them are onboard the German NGO rescue vessel Sea-Watch 3, which has been at sea for 17 days after Italy and Malta refused it permission to dock. An additional 17 people were rescued off the coast of Libya on 29 December by a second vessel, which is operated by another German humanitarian group, Sea-Eye.\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people rescued in the Mediterranean have been denied entry into Italy in similar standoffs since Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, started a clampdown on immigration within days of coming to power last June.\nAs the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, tries to reach an agreement with other EU states to take in some of the stranded, Salvini has refused to relent, writing on Facebook that Italy\u2019s ports \u201cwill remain closed to those who don\u2019t respect the rules\u201d. Salvini ignored a plea from Pope Francis on Sunday for European leaders to \u201cshow solidarity\u201d and offer a safe port to the 49 people onboard the Sea-Watch 3 and the Sea-Eye.\nSalvini also appears to be at odds with his coalition partner Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime minister and leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S). On Saturday Di Maio insisted Malta take responsibility for those onboard but that Italy would welcome the 10 women and their children who were among them.\nMalta allowed the two ships to shelter from bad weather near its coast and for them to be resupplied with fresh food and water, but refused to let those onboard disembark, arguing that they were rescued beyond the country\u2019s search-and-rescue zone.\nIn response to Di Maio, Salvini, who is also interior minister, struck a dismissive tone, saying: \u201cMigrants? I\u2019m the one who decides.\u201d\nDi Maio said on Monday he supported his government\u2019s tough immigration line but that he believed that the women and children ought to be taken in.\nBut clashes with the League has caused ruptures within Di Maio\u2019s own ranks. The M5S expelled two senators, including Gregorio De Falco, for voting against a security bill drafted by Salvini that targets asylum rights. Two MEPs were also expelled for failing to follow party rules.\n\u201cI voted against the security bill because it is abnormal, unconstitutional and will produce a greater number of illegal [immigrants] and insecurity,\u201d De Falco told the Guardian. \u201cThere are others in opposition - the far-right policies of the League are not the policies of the M5S.\u201d\nDozens of mayors across Italy have also refused to implement the security bill.\nDe Falco said the closure of sea ports was not an official government measure and that Di Maio and Salvini were simply giving the impression of a united front.\n\u201cThere are splits on many aspects. The two sides are not united nor, to tell the truth, is that the intention,\u201d he said.\nRino Marinello, an M5S senatorr, said that while Italy should take in women and children from the two ships, other EU states needed to play their part.\n\u201cThese migrants need medical assistance as soon as possible \u2026 but it is time that Europe makes new agreements for the resettlement of migrants,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt also time for Europe to invest in Africa and improve peoples\u2019 conditions there. We can\u2019t just stare at Africa while human traffickers are making millions out of migrants.\u201d\nAs the sparring continues, Frank D\u00f6rner, a doctor on the Sea-watch 3, said the rescued people were in a \u201cdire situation\u201d. A few days ago, one jumped into the sea in an attempt to reach Malta and was quickly brought back onboard.\n\u201cThe situation is getting more and more unstable,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were already traumatised when they reached our boat but every day the stress level is increasing.\u201d",

The team had earlier denied there was any change of leadership expected but after failing to mount a season-long challenge to Mercedes in 2018 Arrivabene has been dispensed with after four years in charge \u2013 and only two months before the new F1 season begins.\nArrivabene has most recently overseen two years when the Scuderia were found wanting against Mercedes. Last year was a particular disappointment: despite having the quicker car for considerable periods, a series of driver errors by Sebastian Vettel were compounded by team mistakes that saw their challenge falter and Lewis Hamilton taking the title with two races remaining.\n\u201cAfter four years of untiring commitment and dedication Maurizio Arrivabene is leaving the team,\u201d Ferrari said in a statement. \u201cThe decision was taken together with the company\u2019s top management after lengthy discussions related to Maurizio\u2019s long-term personal interests as well as those of the team itself.

Vettel was responsible for some of their failings in 2018 but the team notably let him down operationally, failing to institute clear orders on occasion and making the wrong tyre choice in qualifying in Japan, an error for which Arrivabene turned on his team.\nBinotto is understood to have been favoured by the former Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne and has extensive pedigree. He joined Ferrari as test race engineer in 1995 and has since been race engine engineer, race engineer and head of engines before being made chief technical officer in 2016, a role in which he has been credited with returning Ferrari to the front of the grid. He will take charge of Vettel and Ferrari\u2019s new driver, Charles Leclerc.",

        "content": "\u201cIf you do a lot of travelling and moving about, it\u2019s easy to go on doing just that,\u201d the artist and picturebook-maker John Burningham once remarked.\nBurningham, who has died aged 82, was referring to his peripatetic upbringing and subsequent community work in Calabria, Israel and Scotland as a young conscientious objector during his period of national service. But \u201cBrum\u201d, as he was known since schooldays to friends, might just as easily have been speaking of his fearless creative journey.\nThe evolution of the art of picturebook-making, of composing a graphic sequence of pictures and words in interdependent harmony, owes much to Burningham, who along with Maurice Sendak was one of the greatest masters of the medium. The word \u201cillustrator\u201d, as it is traditionally employed, is inadequate when attempting to describe Burningham\u2019s oeuvre. With one or two notable exceptions, almost all of his work was self-authored, words and pictures developed and refined in tandem, with increasing subtlety and economy over the course of his career.\nHis first book, published in 1963, was Borka: The Adventures of a Goose With No Feathers, about a goose whose mother knits him a jersey and who has to undertake a journey by boat when the time comes to migrate. The book won that year\u2019s Kate Greenaway medal, and its success launched a career that spanned six decades and more than 60 books.\nThere are many highlights, but the second Greenaway medal winner, Mr Gumpy\u2019s Outing, in 1970, stands out as a brilliant and highly influential example of cumulative graphic storytelling. Other much-loved titles include Avocado Baby (1982), Oi! Get Off Our Train (1989) and Granpa (1984), the last of which which won the Kurt Maschler award in 1984 and was adapted into an animated film in 1989. Burningham also illustrated with distinction Ian Fleming\u2019s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1964 and Kenneth Grahame\u2019s The Wind in the Willows in 1983.\nIn creating what might be termed (in Sendak\u2019s words) \u201cvisual poetry\u201d, Burningham constantly pushed at the boundaries of how much could be left unsaid, always treating the reader\u2019s imagination with the utmost respect, whatever that reader\u2019s age might be. In his books, the space between pictorial and verbal information is often large, inviting the reader to fill in the gaps. These brazen narrative ambiguities fly in the face of the traditional advice to creators of children\u2019s books that all loose ends must be firmly tied up.\nIn contrast to many of his contemporaries, such as Charles Keeping, Brian Wildsmith and Raymond Briggs, Burningham was not by any means a gifted draughtsman. It may be that the absence of mannerism or stylistic trickery in his drawing was key to the purity of voice that connected with so many readers and led to such widespread appreciation, not only in the UK but also across the globe \u2013 Burningham\u2019s books are especially revered in the far east.\nHe was never a confident speaker or writer in the traditional sense; his genius lay in an ability to communicate in a childlike but never childish visual language and in his understanding of the mutually exclusive worlds of childhood and adulthood.\nThis theme was explicitly explored in Come Away from the Water, Shirley (1977) and in Granpa. In each of these masterly works, the respective internal universes of child and adult are contrasted with consummate graphic and verbal economy.\nBorn in Farnham, Surrey, Burningham spent much of his childhood being moved around a succession of progressive schools that his liberally minded parents Jessie Macintosh and Charles Burningham wanted to try out. His father had fought in the trenches in the first world war but was registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of the second world war in 1939.\nThe family let out their house in Farnham and during the war years travelled the country in a caravan, setting up in remote rural spots in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Yorkshire, where his father would find work and John and his older sisters, Margaret and Elspeth, would be sent to the local schools.\nWhile Burningham recalled with fondness the idyllic freedom of a childhood seemingly spent mostly in trees, he was hopelessly disadvantaged academically, with his arrival at each new school seeming to involve grappling with a whole new system of learning. At the age of 13 some stability arrived when he was sent to AS Neill\u2019s Summerhill in Suffolk, the original \u201calternative\u201d boarding school, where he stayed, leaving with a school certificate in English literature but having failed the art exam.\nAfter two and a half years of non-military service as a conscientious objector, involving heavy labour on forestry and housing projects, Burningham bumped into a former Summerhill school friend on Waterloo Bridge in London, who mentioned that he was studying illustration and graphic design at the Central School of Art. John liked the sound of this and decided to try for a place himself. Despite not having attended the usual prerequisite art foundation course he presented a portfolio of drawings and was accepted.\nAt the Central he was taught by the painter Keith Vaughan, the designer and illustrator Laurence Scarfe and the textile designer Bernard Nevill. Here he met and later married, in 1964, Helen Oxenbury. Although Helen was studying theatre design, her own career as an illustrator blossomed too, and she went on to create many award-winning picture books including, with Michael Rosen, We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt (1989). Musing on how two artists so successful in the same field managed to stay together for so long, John speculated that the reason must be that each of them always thought of the other as the better artist.\nBurningham graduated from the Central with distinction in 1959. Contemporaries there included the illustrator John Lawrence, who recalled with great affection Burningham\u2019s wicked sense of humour and the fact that, unusually for the time, he always had transport of one kind or another, initially a Vespa scooter and later a military jeep. \u201cHe was always dashing off somewhere. He would roll up and say \u2018I\u2019m just off to Salisbury Plain, John, do you want to come?\u2019\u201d\nBurningham travelled again after graduating, including a trip back to Israel, where he made puppets for Yoram Gross\u2019s animation film Joseph the Dreamer (1961). But his first big break came in London shortly afterwards when he was commissioned by Harold Hutchinson, publicity director at London Transport, to produce a number of posters. This was something of a dream commission for a young illustrator, being comparatively well paid, printed to the highest standards of the time and presenting the artist\u2019s work at large scale to a wide audience.\nThis experience of designing bold, graphic, full-colour posters clearly had an impact on the evolution of Burningham\u2019s work in picturebooks. Most illustrators at the time would serve their apprenticeship through commissions for tightly controlled black and white line drawing, graduating to the occasional colour job if lucky.\nBut it was the experience of being told that his work was \u201cposter design rather than book illustration\u201d when hawking his portfolio around that led Burningham to take matters into his own hands and to create a complete picturebook to show to publishers. The book was Borka, and was taken up by Tom Maschler at Jonathan Cape.\nLawrence and another illustrator, John Vernon Lord, the latter a beneficiary of the brief period that Burningham spent teaching at the Central, recall visiting him in his London flat at the time he was working on Borka. They both recall their amazement at climbing down into the Percy Street basement and seeing the emerging spreads from the book laid out across the floor and Burningham continuing, apparently randomly, to apply bursts of car paint spray and swipes of boot polish to the artworks.\nThis fearless, painterly approach to media was suddenly possible as new developments in printing technology allowed for better reproduction. The richly textured Wildsmith\u2019s ABC had paved the way, winning the Greenaway medal in 1962, and these two artists were at the forefront of a new and vibrant era of picturebooks. Later, Burningham would explore further the possibilities of photographic collage and paint through experimental books such as England (1992), Cloudland (1996) and France (1998).\nIn 2010 Burningham and Oxenbury collaborated for the first time to produce There\u2019s Going to Be a Baby. Last year, they were jointly awarded the BookTrust\u2019s lifetime achievement award, for their outstanding contribution to children\u2019s literature.\nHelen survives him, along with their son and two daughters, and seven grandchildren.\n John Mackintosh Burningham, artist, author and illustrator, born 27 April 1936; died 4 January 2019",

No. They were none of those things.\nThey were quite fluffy. This is literally about the squirrels that live in New York City.\nOh, good. What have they been up to now, the little rascals? Scampering up trees? Nibbling nuts that they hold in both paws? Nibbling yes, but not nuts.\nWhat then? First an avocado, then an egg roll and now an Oreo cookie. All recorded on people\u2019s smartphone and uploaded to social media. They are all internet famous now.\nSo there are squirrel influencers? How intriguing. Did they spread the avocado on a charcoal croissant? Do Instagram squirrels offer tips on fur-care? No. Although one New York squirrel did eat a croissant in 2015, in an attempt to upstage the famous pizza rat, arguably New York\u2019s first rodent influencer.\n And where are they getting these tasty snacks from? We don\u2019t yet know how they are getting hold of these delicious dishes, but the New York parks department advises people not to feed them directly.\nSpoilsports. \u201cThey can find their own food,\u201d the department says, \u201cwhich is healthier for them than human food.\u201d Squirrels also sometimes bite people who try to feed them.\nUngrateful wretches. Yes, but we don\u2019t want them to become too tame. \u201cFeeding a squirrel can make them less fearful of humans, which can also hurt them in the long run,\u201d apparently.\nBut now someone is buying them meals? Perhaps. Or maybe New York\u2019s resourceful squirrels have begun taking human food for themselves.\nAre you accusing them of theft? I\u2019m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation. But of course they might be stealing our unhealthy food deliberately in order to make us give them nuts and berries for free.\nThat sounds unlikely. And risky. Have many squirrels visited their doctors with symptoms of diabetes? We have no smartphone evidence for that. But they are very intelligent, you know. They have been observed pretending to bury nuts to fool other squirrels.\nSo now they will have to pretend that they are burying egg rolls? I guess.\nWouldn\u2019t it be cleverer to stop biting people? Maybe, but we sometimes bite them, too. Squirrel is a traditional meal in parts of the US, and you can buy wild squirrel meat in the UK.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to eat a squirrel that has been stealing city food. Maybe that\u2019s part of the plan, too.\nDo say: \u201cSquirrels are just rats with a PR department.\u201d\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019ll have the Oreo-fed squirrel tartare, please.\u201d",

Pre-term birth clinics will be encouraged to help those at risk, including younger mothers and those from deprived backgrounds. The long-term plan also talks about minimising unnecessary intervention, improving foetal heartbeat monitoring and reducing smoking during pregnancy.\nCardiovascular diseases are seen as the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the next decade. The public will be offered increased opportunities to be tested for high blood pressure and other high-risk conditions. There will also be expanded access to genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), which causes early heart attacks. Defibrillator networks will be built to improve survival from out of hospital cardiac arrest and there is a goal of 85% of eligible patients accessing cardiac rehabilitation by 2028.\nThe threshold for referral by GPs will be lowered, and diagnosis and treatment accelerated. There will be new tests for bowel cancer, mobile lung cancer screening units and rapid diagnostic centres that yield a result on the same day. The age at which people are offered bowel cancer screening will be lowered from 60 to 50. There will be use of personalised and risk stratified screening and the NHS will begin to test family members of cancer patients for the disease. All children with cancer will be offered genetic testing to enable more comprehensive and precise diagnosis and access to more personalised treatments. Advanced CAR-T and proton-beam therapy will be available to children in England.\nLaunching the 10-year plan, Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said learning disabilities and autism had previously gone unsupported by the NHS. The plan aims to increase uptake of health checks by people with a learning disability and a specific health check for people with autism is being piloted. There will be action to tackle over-medication and staff will receive information and training on supporting people with a learning disability and/or autism. Their condition will be digitally flagged in their patient record by 2023/24. NHS England is also aiming to reduce waiting times for specialist services to facilitate speedier diagnosis and to increase investment in community support services.\nAn estimated 345,000 more children and young people will be treated via NHS funded mental health services and school or college-based mental health support teams over the next five years. Over the same period, an extra 380,000 more adults will be offered access to talking therapies. By 2023/24, there will also be community-based care available for 370,000 people with severe mental illness each year. Crisis care, which NHS bosses say is a serious weakness, will be improved by people of all ages being able to ring the NHS 111 helpline at any time and be directed to support. Mental health liaison services will be available in all A&E departments and ambulance staff will be trained to respond effectively to people experiencing a mental health crisis.\nAn extra 24,000 women with moderate to severe perinatal mental health difficulties and a personality disorder diagnosis will get care each year by 2023/24, on top of the extra 30,000 women getting specialist help by 2020/21. Care provided by specialist perinatal mental health services will be expanded to be available from preconception to 24 months after birth. Partners of women accessing specialist perinatal mental health services and maternity outreach clinics will also be offered assessment for their mental health.",

The Guardian understands a range of related issues will also be discussed, including cutting the length of the tournament to assist player welfare.\nAgainst a backdrop of uncertain economic forecasts, the recent sizeable private equity investment in English club rugby and the assorted different priorities of unions across Europe, all stakeholders will be asked to confirm their desire to remain in the tournament before June 2020 when, technically, a participant has the right to give two years\u2019 notice should it wish to leave.\nAs thing stand, European officials say there is no imminent danger of the competition ending but with talks ongoing about easing the congested global fixture list and the Guinness Pro14 now featuring clubs from South Africa the landscape is an increasingly volatile one and the Champions Cup\u2019s existing television and sponsorship deals are due to expire in three years\u2019 time.\nEuropean club rugby\u2019s flagship tournament has been among the biggest success stories of the professional era since it was launched in 1995-96 and this season\u2019s final in Newcastle in May is already a sell-out. With increasing calls for top players to play fewer matches, however, it is understood that a proposal to cut the number of European weekends from nine to seven or eight is set to be aired.\nOne possibility is for the pool stages to be reduced from six to four matches per team, with the semi-finals possibly being played over two home and away legs as happens in football. This might well involve reducing the number of competing teams from 20 to 16, which would not go down well among those potentially excluded.\nWhatever happens Simon Halliday, chairman of European Professional Club Rugby, is among those who firmly believe that safeguarding player welfare is crucial to the game\u2019s future. \u201cIf we\u2019re only going to pay lip service to player welfare, we don\u2019t deserve to have a leadership position in our sport,\u201d said Halliday, uncomfortably aware that next season\u2019s cup is due to start 12 days after the World Cup final.\nThe former Bath, Harlequins and England centre is equally keen to ensure the tournament retains its lustre. \u201cThere is no longer term as we currently sit here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe facts are that everything \u2013 the heads of agreement, television and sponsorship revenues \u2013 is due to unwind at the same time in 2022. Theoretically at the end of the 2020 season people can declare their wish to continue or not. I think the competition is absolutely safe but you can\u2019t sleepwalk into the next cycle. That\u2019s just irresponsible.\u201d\nEPCR is also keeping a close eye on Brexit developments, with the United Kingdom due to leave the European Union on 29 March, the same weekend as the European quarter-finals are scheduled. In the event of widespread travel disruption, there would be numerous potential issues for fans, players and officials to overcome. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a board meeting within the next month and it\u2019ll be on the agenda but I would like to think there will be an outbreak of commonsense,\u201d said Halliday.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone sees an Armageddon scenario. I think the practicalities will win out eventually because I don\u2019t believe anyone, least of all the EU, are going to want to create chaos.\u201d\nSale have confirmed the signing of the Wasps tighthead prop Jake Cooper-Woolley. The 29-year-old will join the Sharks on a three-year deal this summer after six years with Wasps. \u201cSale looks like a great opportunity for me to challenge myself in a new environment,\u201d said Cooper-Woolley. \u201cThe club are on the up and hopefully I can play a big part in them having a successful future both domestically and in Europe.\u201d",

        "content": "It is untruthful to suggest that private schools take IGCSEs because they are easier (Labour calls for an inquiry into GCSE changes \u2018gamed by private schools\u2019, 31 December).\nUntil 2010, grade inflation had been rampant at both GCSE and A-level for at least a decade. During the years of New Labour, syllabuses were dumbed down, with simplistic coursework a key requirement of almost every subject. For a few unhappy years, GCSEs even became modular, as A-levels then were, so the nation\u2019s children took public exams every single summer from year 10 to year 13.\nThose were the main reasons that many independent schools moved to IGCSE in middle school, and some, like King\u2019s, introduced the International Baccalaureate in the sixth form. We wanted to encourage teaching that was more stimulating and demanding; we thought we were making things better \u2013 not easier.\nFinally, the difficulty or otherwise of an exam rests partly in the generosity of marking. In 2016, to gain a C in the \u201ceasier\u201d, pre-reform GCSE maths, you needed to get 34% of your answers right. In 2017, under the reformed system, just 17% was considered enough for a grade 4 \u2013 or \u201cstandard pass\u201d. To the glory of neither, I suspect the difference in difficulty between reformed GCSEs and IGCSEs is infinitesimal.Andrew HallsHeadmaster, King\u2019s College School, Wimbledon\n It\u2019s welcome news that Labour is demanding an inquiry into the ways private schools are \u201cgaming\u201d the examination system, and Angela Rayner is absolutely correct to say that we cannot have an education system \u201cwith different rules for the privileged few\u201d. The inquiry, however, must go further than looking into what is happening at GCSE level.\nThe fact that more and more private schools are opting for Pre-U exams rather than A-levels is also worthy of investigation. With much higher percentages of A*/A grades, papers set and marked by teachers in the independent sector, and with a more lightly regulated regime than A-levels, Pre-U examinations, provided by Cambridge Assessment, could well be another means of giving the privately educated yet more advantage over pupils from underfunded state schools \u201cin the race for university places\u201d.\nThe general secretary of the Independent Schools Council might well say that private schools have a duty \u201cto ensure their pupils are fully prepared for their next steps in life\u201d, but is it fair that those \u201csteps\u201d are so far ahead of pupils in the state sector, when increasingly suspicious methods are being used?Bernie EvansLiverpool\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

We found nearly half (48%) of girls aged 11-18 in the UK have experienced some form of abuse on social media.\nIt\u2019s alarming that these negative experiences are destroying girls\u2019 self-confidence, causing them to have sleepless nights and leading them to experience depressive symptoms. Girls tell us that they want the digital space to be somewhere they can share ideas and find their voice without feeling threatened, but with little support they are withdrawing from the online world.\nWe urge the government to consider these findings when forming the new relationships and sex education curriculum for schools which is due out next year. Girls especially need to learn how to navigate the digital world and about the risks of social media, but in parallel understand that they have a right to a voice online.Lucy RussellHead of girls\u2019 rights and youth, Plan International UK\n Shannon McLaughlin (Case study: \u2018It affected me physically and mentally\u2019, 4 January) is so brave in speaking about the pressure to show only positive news and images on social media. The distinctive contribution of the psychoanalytic perspective on society and in individual therapeutic work is to recognise the reality that there are positives but also vulnerabilities and difficulties that need some shared recognition and understanding.\nMental health and development can only progress when young people are able to manage and process difficult or negative feelings about themselves and others. Understanding and processing negative worries and thoughts can help creativity, learning, stable relationships and developmental progress. Mental health services and indeed social media platforms themselves must begin to consider this new habit of avoiding negative conversations as deeply alarming for the mental health of children and young people.Jane ElferChild and adolescent psychotherapist\n At last someone, Gaby Hinsliff (Mental health should not be a luxury, but a national goal, 4 January), has pointed out something crucial; something that should be repeated again and again to underpin any mental health policymaking and provision; something so lost in the media miasma of wellbeing approaches \u2013 cooking, running and the like \u2013 as self-help strategies. With such \u201ccooked\u201d offerings, as Hinsliff points out, \u201cwe are some way from the rawest ends of psychiatric wards\u201d, and nowhere near close enough to the shame we should feel, all but abandoning sufferers once an acute episode is over. Dr Lisa DartEastbourne, East Sussex\n Gaby Hinsliff\u2019s article showed more insight into alleviating the problem than some others I have read and the recent batch of readers\u2019 letters (3 January). Back in the 60s I remember seeing a TV documentary on curing alcoholics where commitment to and involvement with other people, or developing specific interests, offered some hope for the \u201cpatients\u201d.\nThis development of interests and involvement with others existed, nationwide, up until 1992 when it was cut off at a stroke by the Major government. It was called local education authority adult education provision and over 2 million people were enrolled annually, mainly in weekly evening classes based in local schools, so easy for people to get to. Learning took place across a wide cross-section of subjects and the people attending came from all social classes. Two-thirds of the participants were women and I often wonder where so many women could go today in places that were safe and held an interest for them together with a sense of achievement \u2013 surely something that would contribute towards the mental health of many people.\nThe schools belong to the community but most now stand empty and idle in the evenings. It is such a waste of excellent facilities in the year when those few of us who are left will be celebrating the Adult Education Report of 1919 which foresaw the need of such provision for the enlightenment and involvement of adults after the conclusion of formal education.David SelbyCounty adviser for adult education (retired), Winchester \n While mental health services have been massively cut under this government, mental health is also a political issue (May to promise mental health treatment for more children, 5 January).\nTo improve mental health, Theresa May needs to decrease poverty, unemployment, isolation, lack of housing and increasing inequalities \u2013 \u201cburning injustices\u201d she promised to address but has made far worse.Dr Julia NelkiChild and adolescent psychiatrist, Birkenhead, Merseyside \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Savills is pencilling in land prices falling to about \u00a313,600 a hectare (\u00a35,500 an acre) compared with the \u00a317,300-plus prices common before the EU referendum.\nEU direct payments make up about 60% of the profits of UK farmers, rising to 90% for livestock hill farms and are worth \u00a33bn a year in total. After Brexit, subsidies that are currently based on how much land farmers cultivate will be replaced from 2021 by payments to farmers and landowners who deliver environmental benefits.\nFarmers committed to protecting habitats, improving flood management and enhancing air and water quality will be rewarded. However, the final shape of the subsidies is not yet known, leading to uncertainty as to who is going to lose out.\nEmily Norton, head of rural research at Savills, said: \u201cWhere we feel values might be knocked is where it\u2019s bare commercial land, which has low natural capital potential. Where we\u2019ve got no opportunity to earn additional public money you\u2019ll be highly exposed to just returns from farming and therefore it\u2019s going to require very high levels of management skill. They will be in demand but prices will be knocked.\u201d\nFarmland was a better investment than even prime central London residential property in the decade running up to the Brexit vote in 2016, but has been falling since. According to Knight Frank an average UK hectare of farmland sold for just \u00a3398 in 1966 but rocketed to a peak of \u00a320,500 in 2015, just before the EU referendum.\nThe fastest-growing part of the property market during the next five years will be \u201curban logistics\u201d, another term for warehouses that supply households with goods bought over the internet. Savills expects returns to average around 10% a year.\nIn the residential property market, the next five years will be all about the north and the Midlands, as a Brexit-hit London market trails behind Manchester and Birmingham in terms of house price rises, according to forecasts.\nSavills is forecasting that an investor in buy-to-let properties in the north-west will earn about 8.4% a year from a mix of rent and capital value increases, compared with 3.9% in London.",

The White House also offered $800m to address \u201curgent humanitarian needs\u201d at the border.\nAll the while, about 800,000 federal workers remained without pay, either at home or on the job, and key government services faced increasing strain and closure. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told NBC that if the shutdown continues into Tuesday, \u201cthen payroll will not go out as originally planned on Friday night\u201d.\nSpeaking to reporters as he left the White House for Camp David on Sunday, Trump claimed many workers without pay \u201cagree 100% with what I\u2019m doing\u201d. Returning, he said: \u201cThey will make an adjustment because they want to see the border taken care of.\u201d\nThe president also floated the idea of declaring a national emergency, thereby circumventing Congress to build his wall. It may have merely been a tactic designed to push Democrats to do a deal but Trump\u2019s opponents said in any case such a move would be, in the words of congressman Adam Schiff, a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, subject to fierce opposition and legal challenges.\nOn Monday morning, Trump tweeted three times complaining about the media, then quoted the new Democratic chairman of the House armed services committee, Adam Smith, as saying: \u201cYes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It\u2019s been done a number of times.\u201d\nCongressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, \u201cYes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It\u2019s been done a number of times.\u201d No doubt, but let\u2019s get our deal done in Congress!\nTrump omitted the rest of Smith\u2019s comment, which came from a Sunday interview on ABC. Smith continued to say: \u201cBut primarily it\u2019s been done to build facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying: \u2018Where is the emergency?\u2019\u201d\nThe new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will this week start passing bills to reopen government agencies, starting with the treasury, in an attempt to ensure people receive tax refunds threatened by the government closure.\nThe moves are meant to pressure Senate Republicans currently sitting out the fight, as the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, seeks to avoid political damage. Among Senate GOP moderates, Susan Collins of Maine expressed support for the Democratic move on Sunday.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get those reopened while the negotiations continue,\u201d she told NBC.\nOn Monday, Senate Democrats indicated they would attempt to block the chamber from voting on any legislation until McConnell moves to allow votes on the House-passed funding bills. The gambit would not end the shutdown but it would, if successful, force Trump to veto government funding legislation if he wants the showdown over the border wall to continue.\nTalks remain at an impasse, following a breakdown in communication. A Democratic official said a Sunday meeting with the White House began 45 minutes late after Trump administration officials failed to produce information requested by Democrats and detailing the president\u2019s budget justification for the border wall.\n\u201cNo progress was made today,\u201d the Democratic aide said, while adding no additional meetings had been scheduled.\nOf the 800,000 workers directly affected, about 420,000 are estimated to be working without pay because they are considered essential. These workers typically receive back pay after a shutdown ends, but it is not guaranteed.\nSome of those workers, such as Transportation Security Administration (TSA) airport screeners, have been calling out sick at higher rates than usual. Union representatives said this is because workers are being forced to take temporary jobs or cannot afford childcare.\nFederal workers have warned the shutdown will have long-term effects.\nHundreds of immigrants\u2019 court hearings have been cancelled, exacerbating an existing backlog of more than a million cases. And hundreds of government scientists say they will miss crucial opportunities to exchange research and ideas because the shutdown is stopping them from attending major scientific conferences about technology, space exploration and climate change.\nOutside the White House on Sunday, Trump said he could \u201crelate\u201d to the federal employees who aren\u2019t being paid during the shutdown.",

This has never been a police issue. In fact, the BC RCMP is impartial and we respect the rights of individuals to peaceful, lawful and safe protest,\u201d they said in a statement. \nEnergy company TransCanada is attempting to build the Coastal GasLink, a 670km line stretching from Dawson Creek to the coastal city of Kitimat. The C$6.2bn (US$4.6bn) project is part of a broader plan to ramp up natural gas exports in the province.\nThe company has previously said it has the support of all elected indigenous leaders along the proposed route, but Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs have signaled they do not support the project \u2013 and argue that elected band leaders are not in the position to negotiate with the company.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the title-holders or the caretakers of the land. The hereditary chiefs are,\u201d said Madeek.\nThe pipeline project has previously faced numerous delays, after a group of protesters constructed a blockade \u2013 named Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp \u2013 in order to prevent construction vehicles from accessing the area.\nOn 14 December, a British Columbia court granted TransCanada an injunction permitting them access to the construction site and ordering the removal of the blockade. Within days, activists erected the new barrier, named the Gidimt\u2019en checkpoint.\nOn Sunday, Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp issued a statement of support for the Gidimt\u2019en checkpoint: \u201cThe RCMP\u2019s ultimatum, to allow TransCanada access to unceded Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory or face police invasion, is an act of war. Canada is now attempting to do what it has always done \u2013 criminalize and use violence against indigenous people so that their unceded homelands can be exploited for profit.\u201d\nBoth the Unist\u2019ot\u2019en and Gitimd\u2019en are part of the five clans which make up the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en.\nIn recent years, British Columbia has been the site of a number of high-profile legal cases surrounding the issue of land title. Because few of the province\u2019s First Nations signed treaties with colonial governments, the courts have often been the arbiters of land rights disputes.\nThe Delgamuukw v British Columbia case \u2013 which covers part of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory \u2013 previously found that indigenous rights to their historical territory are not \u201cextinguished\u201d for lack of a treaty.\nWet\u2019suwet\u2019en claim they retain title to the land and as a result, have sole authority to deny or grant access to the territory.\nThe pipeline feud comes as energy companies in Canada are facing numerous delays and barriers to their infrastructure projects, including environmental assessments and adequate consultations with indigenous communities on whose territory the projects would pass through.\nAnother high-profile pipeline project, Trans Mountain, was halted over the summer after a federal court determined indigenous communities had not been adequately consulted during the approvals process.\nBritish Columbia premier John Horgan, who made headlines for his fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, has cheered on the C$40bn liquid natural gas project \u2013 of which the Coastal GasLink is a critical piece \u2013 citing the large number of jobs and revenue that will result from its completion.\nWhile the provincial government has said the facility will be the cleanest of its kind in the world, a report from the Pembina Institute found that the project would increase the province\u2019s emissions by 8.6 megatonnes by 2030.\nProtesters at the Gitimd\u2019en checkpoint have vowed to prevent the project from being built on their territory.\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for, is to protect the 22,000 sq km and this section of the territory for our grandchildren and our great-great-grandchildren that aren\u2019t even born yet so they can enjoy what we enjoy today out on the territory,\u201d said Madeek.\n This article was amended on 8 January 2019 to make clear that a photograph shows protesters at a demonstration against a separate pipeline project in March 2018",

Ankara sees those forces as a branch of militant Kurdish insurgent inside Turkey and describes them as terrorists.\nAgainst a backdrop of friction and uncertainty, it is unclear who Bolton will be seeing in Ankara. No meetings had been confirmed by Monday afternoon.\nThe Pentagon was initially told to plan for the withdrawal of US soldiers within 100 days. But during to a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday, Bolton said the withdrawal would depend on conditions inside Syria and on Turkish actions.\n\u201cThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal,\u201d Bolton said.\n\u201cTimetables or the timing of the withdrawal occurs as a result of the fulfillment of the conditions and the establishment of the circumstances that we want to see. And once that\u2019s done, then you talk about a timetable.\u201d\nBolton said that one of those conditions would be the total destruction of Isis, who the president had claimed had already been defeated.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear, we\u2019re going to withdraw, we\u2019re going to protect American forces during the withdrawal period, but the president also expects it would be able to accomplish the destruction of the Isis territorial caliphate, and other Isis personnel and facilities that are potentially dangerous to us as we leave,\u201d Bolton said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also very important that as we discuss with members of the coalition [and] other countries that have an interest, like Israel and Turkey, that we expect that those who have fought with us in Syria in the opposition, particularly the Kurds but everybody who\u2019s fought with us, who\u2019s not put in jeopardy by the coalition withdrawal.\u201d\nUS troops, as well as special forces from the UK and France, have fought alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to oust Isis from almost all its \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria. The SDF is led by the Kurdish Protection Units (YPG) which has strong links with Kurdish Workers\u2019 party (PKK) militants in Turkey, a source of constant tension between Ankara and Washington.\n\u201cThe issue is PKK/YPG are making efforts to establish an order by oppressing Kurds who don\u2019t obey them, and by their terrorist activities against our country,\u201d Kalin said, in a rebuke to Bolton. \u201cThere is no doubt that a terror group cannot be an ally of the US.\u201d\n\u201cThere is deep disappointment in Ankara with the US administration, and right now Turkish policy-makers are trying to assess whether this is a policy shift or whether it is empty words and the policy will change again,\u201d Sinan \u00dclgen, a former Turkish diplomat and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe thinktank.\nThe White House denied there had been a policy shift, and Trump went on Twitter on Monday to denounce the New York Times for its reporting of Bolton\u2019s comments.\n\u201cNo different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!..\u201d Trump tweeted. Bolton retweeted the president, adding \u201cMy thoughts exactly.\nPompeo said in an interview published on Monday: \u201cWe need to have long conversations with the Turks about what this will look like after withdrawal.\u201d\nThe secretary of state said that the US would maintain its relationship with the Syrian Kurds. \u201cWe will find a relationship with them that accommodates all of our interests,\u201d he told Bloomberg News.\nPompeo is due to embark on a tour of eight Arab capitals, with the aim of steadying alliances in the wake of Trump\u2019s surprises announcement and the subsequent resignation of US defence secretary James Mattis.\nTrump tweeted on 19 December: \u201cWe have defeated Isis in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.\u201d\nDuring his heated phone call with Erdo\u011fan five days earlier, he is reported to have declared: \u201cOK, it\u2019s all yours. We are done.\u201d\nBy Sunday, however, he appeared to agree with Bolton that the withdrawal would be conditional. \u201cWe are pulling back in Syria. We\u2019re going to be removing our troops,\u201d he told reporters. But he added: \u201cWe won\u2019t be finally pulled out until Isis is gone.\u201d\nNicholas Heras, a fellow at the Centre for a New American Security, said: \u201cI think there is an intramural battle going on within the administration by the designated Syria policy team, trying to repair damage done by the president\u2019s announcement.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cTrump came off a bad month in December and thought that the Syria announcement would be a quick win for his base.\u201d",

        "content": "Scandal over diesel emissions is a bigger factor in explaining last year\u2019s sales dip\nSpare a thought for the car dealer waiting for the next customer to wander into a showroom choc-a-bloc with gleaming unsold saloons. Car sales last year were well down on 2017 \u2013 falling by almost 7% . Contrary to some of the more lurid headlines, though, this is not an economic cataclysm.\nNot so long ago, the 2018 total for new registrations \u2013 just shy of 2.4m \u2013 would have been a cause for celebration. The number last year was similar to that in 2005 and 2006, the last years of strong economic growth before the financial crash.\nThere are some pretty obvious reasons for the decline in registrations. Fleet sales have been affected by the cautious approach to investment taken by companies while the outcome of Brexit remains uncertain.\nConsumer spending has proved more resilient but has not been immune to Brexit doom and gloom. There has been a reluctance to commit to spending on big-ticket items \u2013 a tendency that has also affected the housing market.\nBut it\u2019s more than politics. The scandal over hushed-up tests for diesel emissions was a bigger factor than Brexit in explaining last year\u2019s sales dip, because it hit demand for new diesel models and made second-hand vehicles harder to shift.\nThere is a broader point here: consumers are getting more use out of products before changing them. The run-them-until-they-pack-up mentality has always applied to white goods in the kitchen \u2013 fridges and washing machines \u2013 but has now expanded to mobile phones and laptops, and perhaps cars as well. Motor manufacturers have accelerated this process by reliability and durability upgrades that mean the average car is better than it was two or three decades ago, so reducing the incentive to trade it in.\nMake no mistake, this is good news at a time when the world is supposed to be getting more serious about the heightened risks of climate change. If the notion of what constitutes economic good news is that the number of new cars should go up each year, then we should rethink our definitions of success and failure.\nIn this context, Tuesday sees the launch by Diane Coyle, from the Bennett Institute at the University of Cambridge, of alternative metrics for gauging how well a country is faring, based around long-term sustainability rather than the ups and downs of GDP. To which the only logical response is: not before time.\nIt\u2019s not easy running an international organisation with Mr America First sitting in the White House, but even so the departure of Jim Yong Kim as president of the World Bank came as a shock. Kim is leaving more than three years before the end of his allotted tenure, leading inevitably to rumours of a clash with Donald Trump.\nNot so, apparently. Kim has always got on well with Trump, even playing golf with him in the days before he beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race. The story is that Kim thought he had done most of what he had set out to do at the Bank when he arrived in 2012 \u2013 a big increase in the organisation\u2019s capital, two replenishments of the fund that helps the poorest countries and the launch of new targets for poverty reduction and advances in human capital \u2013 and didn\u2019t want to be a president who simply kept things ticking over.\nIn theory, Kim\u2019s successor will be chosen by the \u201cone, merit-based, transparent\u201d procedure agreed by the Bank\u2019s shareholders in 2012. In reality, Trump will expect to nominate an American for the job because the Europeans have always chosen one of their own to run the International Monetary Fund and the US has picked the president of the Bank.\nThis cosy arrangement has long been an anachronism. With Trump likely to choose someone for political reasons rather than an expertise or interest in development, it is now positively dangerous.",

        "content": "The Netherlands has been a place of refuge for Jews since at least the 15th century when Sephardic Jews fleeing from Portugal found freedom and prosperity there. In 1677, the sceptical Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza was buried with honours in the Protestant New Church in The Hague, which Bart van Es describes as \u201can astonishing gesture of acceptance\u201d. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, some 35,000 refugees fled to the Netherlands. By 1940, when Germany invaded Holland, there were some 18,000 Jews in The Hague, which portrayed itself as an open and idealistic \u201ccity for the world\u201d. Only 2,000 of them would survive the war and the concentration camps.\nHesseline, known as Lien, lived there, at 31 Pletterijstraat, with her parents, Charles and Catharine de Jong-Spiero. Although they were married at a synagogue, Lien\u2019s parents were not observant: \u201cIt is really Hitler who makes Lien Jewish.\u201d From 1941, seven-year-old Lien attends a Jewish school. Jews have a \u201cJ\u201d stamped in their passports and are banned from the civil service, cinemas and universities. Signs appear outside markets and parks: \u201cForbidden for Jews\u201d. In May 1942, her mother had to stitch a yellow star with the word \u201cJew\u201d on to their clothes and eight-year-old Lien was bullied by children calling her a \u201cdirty Jew\u201d.\nOne day her mother sat beside her on the bed. \u201cI must tell you a secret,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are going to stay somewhere else for a while.\u201d A woman took Lien to a family in Dordrecht. Unknown to Lien, they were arrested within months and sent to their deaths in Auschwitz. The family she stayed with are the author\u2019s grandparents, Jans and Henk van Es. But just as shestarted to feel at home, the police arrived and she had to run. Lien spent the rest of the war with a strict Protestant family in the village of Bennekom. There she was treated as a servant rather than one of the family, and sexually abused by one of their relations: \u201cThe rapes are a secret, hard and poisonous, that she swaddles within.\u201d\nSome 4,000 Jewish children survived the war in hiding in Holland. Lien was one of just 358 who stayed with a non-Jewish family after 1945: she asked to return to the Van Eses. Bart van Es \u2013 an Oxford English professor who has lived in Britain since the age of three \u2013 had always known that his grandparents had sheltered Jewish children. But it was only after the death of his uncle in 2014 that he began to ask questions and made contact with Lien, now in her 80s and living in Amsterdam.\nWinner of the 2018 Costa biography award, this deeply moving account of Lien\u2019s life is the result of his personal journey into the history of his family and his country\u2019s treatment of the Jews. Many felt their suffering was not adequately acknowledged after the war. Unbelievably, some even received tax demands for the time they spent in the camps.\nWriting with an almost Sebaldian simplicity and understatement, Van Es weaves together history and Lien\u2019s recollections to tell the story of her traumatic childhood. Unsurprisingly, what she experienced left her \u201cbadly damaged\u201d and questioning her very existence: \u201cI ought not to be here.\u201d The Van Eses did not understand the true depth of Lien\u2019s trauma as one of the \u201chidden children\u201d and this led to tragic misunderstandings later when Jans fell out with Lien, ending all communication with her. Even as an adult, Lien seemed fated to be \u201ccut out\u201d from her family. By telling Lien\u2019s story, Van Es brings her back into it, an experience he describes as transformative: \u201cgetting to know Lien has changed me\u201d.\n PD Smith\u2019s City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age is published by Bloomsbury.

Although only an idea for now, her intervention raises questions over whether such a policy might work in another country with sharp economic divisions: the UK.\nHer proposal would apply to income above $10m (\u00a37.8m) a year. Ocasio-Cortez argued that the wealthiest Americans needed to pay their fair share of taxes to help fund a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d for the US to combat climate change, while also tackling inequality.\nBritain was used to higher top rates of income tax as recently as the late 1970s, when the highest rate was set at 83% under the Labour government of Jim Callaghan, before the rise of neoliberal economic policy under Margaret Thatcher.\nThe prevailing logic in UK government since has tended to be that lower headline rates of tax help to encourage individual enterprise, empower wealth and job creators, and attract the brightest and best to Britain, boosting economic growth.\nThatcher oversaw reductions in the top tax rate to 60% and then to 40% by 1988, where it has remained until Gordon Brown introduced a 50% additional rate on earnings above \u00a3150,000 after the 2008 financial crisis.\nGeorge Osborne, however, cut that additional rate to 45% in 2012, arguing that Brown had not managed to bring in any additional revenue because wealthy taxpayers altered their arrangements to avoid the tax. In Scotland the highest band is 46% on earnings above \u00a3150,000.\nDebates have raged over the optimum levels for individual taxation in the UK ever since income tax was introduced in 1799 to help finance the wars with France.\nGovernments in the 21st century have tended to worry that higher tax rates might cause the richest to change their behaviour to avoid taxes, losing them potential revenue, or to flee the country altogether.\nDuring the 1970s, the US economist Arthur Laffer argued that higher tax rates would only generate higher revenue up to a certain level before revenue declined, a theory known as the \u201cLaffer curve\u201d.\nThe idea was that the more money the government took, the less incentive there was to work. If the government took 100% of your income, there was no point in working.\nHigher income tax rates could result in wealthy individuals shifting their earnings into company shares, which attract a lower rate of taxation as capital gains, or into offshore vehicles. Globalisation has increased in recent decades, meaning that the super-rich can more easily relocate their tax affairs.\nHigher tax rates may also reduce household spending, as the state takes money that individuals would otherwise spend, damaging the economy. On the flipside, however, the state may have more money to spend to boost the size of the economy, for example through more investment in education or infrastructure.\nEconomists say for this reason, among others, the evidence is mixed that lower rates can boost revenue from taxes, or the size of the economy. Scandinavian economies such as Sweden have higher rates than the UK, without falling behind in the global economic league tables.\nStuart Adam, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \u201cAll the scare stories that everyone will leave the country are clearly nonsense. But saying there will be no response is clearly nonsense also. The question is where we are in between \u2013 and it\u2019s difficult to know.\u201d\nRising levels of inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the ballooning government budget deficit, have raised renewed questions over whether higher income tax rates could be used to redistribute wealth.\nThere is a sixfold difference between the income of the top 20% of households and those of the bottom 20%. Meanwhile, wealth inequality is much worse: 44% of the UK\u2019s wealth is owned by only 10% of the population, five times the total wealth held by the poorest half.\nToday the UK (with the exception of Scotland) has a basic rate income tax of 20% for earnings above \u00a311,500, a higher rate of 40% on earnings over \u00a345,001, and the additional rate of 45% for income over \u00a3150,000.\nScotland has a starter rate of 19% for earnings from \u00a311,850 to \u00a313,850, a basic rate of 20% from \u00a313,851 to \u00a324,000, an intermediate rate of 21% from \u00a324,001 to \u00a343,430, a higher rate of 41% from \u00a343,431 to \u00a3150,000, and a top rate of 46% on income above \u00a3150,000.\nAs much as the actual rate of taxation, these thresholds matter. First, they mean that not all of a person\u2019s earnings are taxed at the same level: someone earning \u00a3200,000 a year in England, for example, would only hand over 45% to the government on \u00a350,000. The rest would attract lower rates of taxation.\nThere are about 31 million people in Britain paying individual income tax. About 26.3 million are classified as paying the basic rate, while 4.3 million pay the higher rate and only 393,000 pay the additional rate \u2013 about 1% of all taxpayers.\nHowever, despite being in the minority, the top 50% paid 90.6% of total income tax (about \u00a3178bn) collected in 2015-16. The top 1% of taxpayers paid 28.8% of the total.\nGiven the low numbers of high-tax payers involved, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s suggestion of a 70% rate for those receiving more than $10m would mean very few people outside of FTSE 100 chief executives and hedge fund bosses would pay such a rate.\nFor this reason, many economists say that higher tax bands are more useful as political statements rather than as revenue raisers.\nWealth taxes \u2013 levied on items such as property and inheritance money \u2013 might be a better idea, according to Carys Roberts, a senior economist at the IPPR thinktank.\nTotal household wealth has rapidly risen to almost \u00a313tn, with the top 10% owning half of it, and is taxed at comparatively low rates.\n\u201cWe need to have conversation on tax, about recapturing some of the huge gains that are being made at the top of society. The only point where I differ is in how best to do that,\u201d she said.\n This article was amended on 8 January 2019 to reflect the different tax bands that apply in Scotland.",

        "content": "Manager cites Ars\u00e8ne Wenger as having faced similar pressures \u2018If we want to win titles, we need to operate in a different way\u2019\nMauricio Pochettino was in soul-searching mood. The Tottenham manager had brought up Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and how his former adversary at Arsenal had endured \u201ca lot of limitations\u201d with regard to the Emirates Stadium project but, at the same time, was still expected to win trophies.\nTo Pochettino the parallels to his present situation are plain and that is not to say they have surprised him or made him unhappy. He knew what he was signing up for in 2014 when he accepted the job offer from the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, and the overall boss, Joe Lewis.\nIt was to manage the team on a relative shoestring, driving it as hard as he could, as the club streamed their revenues into the new stadium project. In other words, precisely what Wenger did for much of the second half of his 22-year Arsenal tenure.\nPochettino\u2019s problem \u2013 if that is the right word \u2013 has been that he has performed ahead of the curve. He says that Levy\u2019s demand was for the club to enter the new stadium with the chance to compete for a top-four Premier League finish and then to deliver one in the season after that.\nInstead Pochettino has returned top-three finishes in each of the last three seasons and the expectation now is that he wins trophies. It is the obvious next step, albeit the most difficult one, and it colours the club\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea \u2013 the first leg of which is at Wembley on Tuesday night.\nPochettino\u2019s thoughts turned to Wenger\u2019s longevity and loyalty at Arsenal and he said he had one question for him: was it worth it? It is a question that appears to resonate with Pochettino as he approaches a crossroads in his career. Does he remain true to the project at Spurs or would he be tempted by an offer from Manchester United or Real Madrid in the summer?\n\u201cI hope, if I have the opportunity to talk with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, to ask if it was worth it?\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he would say.\u201d\nHe has an inkling. \u201cI have massive, huge respect for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger because when you talk about 22 years in charge of a club like Arsenal, you need to be so good \u2013 not only a fantastic coach but a great human being, to display the values you have,\u201d the Tottenham coach said. \u201cThat is why it is a little bit sad the way it ended at his club. It shows how difficult this business is. But for us it is not a business, it is a passion. All that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger gave for Arsenal, to finish in the way it finished, yes, was a little bit unfair.\n\u201cDo I see the similarity between his situation at Arsenal and mine at Spurs? Yes, although it\u2019s true this is only my fifth year. It\u2019s true we work and we know the reality and sometimes we cannot expect that the people live the same reality or have the same knowledge about what happens inside [the club].\n\u201cI hope or I wish to be here 20 years and decide to leave or to finish my career here. But I don\u2019t know because I need to ask him one day if he is so happy in the way that he finished [for him]. From my point of view it was so unfair how the people treated him and talked. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nPochettino made the point explicitly that he is happy at Spurs at the moment. He will not deviate from this line. But he also acknowledges it is impossible to foresee the future.\n\u201cThe only way the people think is about money,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThat is going to help but at the moment I am happy. Today the club is doing what the club needs to do and I am so happy to be here. The project is so clear. It\u2019s true the people are so impatient but it\u2019s going to arrive. We are creating a legacy that is going to be amazing for the future of the club. I can see in the future Tottenham winning trophies. I don\u2019t know if [it will be] with us or without. In one year or five years.\u201d\nThe issue of squad strengthening is never far away in English football, particularly in January, and Pochettino said that, if Spurs are to win the biggest prizes, they must invest more heavily. \u201cI saw a stat about how teams were spending money in the last 10 years and we were on the bottom in England and Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to be real contenders, we need to operate in a different way in the future. At the moment it\u2019s fantastic \u2013 so far so good \u2013 but we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s enough to challenge and be consistent in the next five years operating in that way; if we\u2019re capable to fight with the big sides in the same way that we\u2019ve fought [with them] in the last four or five years.\u201d\nPochettino is not the type of manager to bang down the chairman\u2019s door demanding new signings and at Spurs he has relished the challenge of finding other ways to compete, such as developing players from the academy. Equally he is not blind to the benefits of big spending.\n\u201cIf you have money, like the other top six clubs, and you need [something], you buy it,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIf we need, we build and we need time to build. There is Chelsea, Arsenal, City, Liverpool, United \u2013 and us. When people put us in the same level with expectations and everything, it\u2019s unfair.\u201d",

        "content": "Letter to Met police comes after Speaker expresses concern about protesters targeting MPs outside parliament \nDozens of MPs have written to the UK\u2019s most senior police officer to raise concerns about safety outside parliament after the Conservative MP Anna Soubry faced chants from protesters on Monday calling her a \u201cNazi\u201d.\nAt least 55 parliamentarians signed the letter to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, after the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, urged officers to do more to protect MPs and Soubry criticised the lack of police response to the abuse.\nScotland Yard later confirmed it had opened an investigation into whether any offences had been committed when chants of \u201cSoubry is a Nazi\u201d could clearly be heard while the pro-remain MP was being interviewed by BBC News on Abingdon Green, a grassed area outside parliament used by broadcasters.\nIt is the second time in recent weeks that Soubry has been targeted by a small group of pro-Brexit protesters wearing yellow vests, some of whom have links to the far right. On the earlier occasion, she was surrounded by shouting men calling her a traitor.\nThe MPs\u2019 letter to Dick reads: \u201cAfter months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far-right and extreme-right connections, which your officers are well aware of, have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting members of parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public.\n\u201cWe understand there are ongoing investigations but there appears to be an ongoing lack of coordination in the response from the police and appropriate authorities including with Westminster borough policing, and despite clear assurances this would be dealt with following incidents before Christmas, there have been a number of further serious and well publicised incidents today.\u201d\nIn the letter, the MPs said they wanted to ensure that people retained the right to protest peacefully outside parliament. \u201cIt is, however, utterly unacceptable for members of parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public to be subject to abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour and indeed potentially serious offences while they go about their work.\u201d\nAfter the latest incident against Soubry, the Conservative MP Nick Boles raised the issue with Bercow, asking what could be done to end the harassment.\nBercow said safety off the parliamentary estate was not part of his remit, but he took the issue very seriously and had been in touch with police, \u201cwho have been made very well aware of our concerns\u201d.\nThe Speaker told MPs: \u201cPeaceful protest is a vital democratic freedom, but so is the right of elected members to go about their business without being threatened or abused, and that includes access to and from the media stands in Abingdon Green. I am concerned at this stage about what seem to be a pattern of protest targeted in particular \u2013 I don\u2019t say exclusively \u2013 at women.\u201d\nHe was backed by other MPs, among them Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh, who said such \u201cvile, misogynist thuggery, abuse and harassment\u201d raised particular worries following the murder of her colleague Jo Cox in 2016 by a far-right terrorist.\nThe small but highly visible and noisy band of yellow-vested activists harassing MPs and journalists outside parliament are ostensibly protesting in favour of Brexit, but have links to wider far-right activism of the sort carried out by Tommy Robinson.\nRobinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has built both a huge social media following and a handsome living from anti-Muslim protests. He has recently tried to latch on to pro-Brexit activism, co-organising a so-called Brexit Betrayal march in London in December.\nThe group outside parliament, almost all of whom are men, are not formally linked to Robinson, or his new political partners in Ukip, but have similar roots. They have modelled their outfits on the French gilets jaunes protests.\nJames Goddard, a self-styled \u201cpolitical activist\u201d who filmed Tory MP Anna Soubry being abused and harassed in December, is the most prominent of the group, and has appeared at many of their small-scale protests, including blockades of Westminster bridge.\nHe gave a speech at a rally in the summer in support of the then-jailed Yaxley-Lennon, and has posted anti-Islam comments on Gab, a niche Twitter-mimicking social media site popular with far-right users.\nGoddard has also been involved in protests connected to an anti-Muslim conspiracy theory which claims that claims an incident in which three teenage boys were killed by a speeding drunk driver as they walked to a party in west London was in fact a terror attack.\nLike Robinson, Goddard has been seeking to make such protests his full-time job by soliciting donations from supporters online.\nBercow said he was aware of incidents \u201cinvolving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members and others by assorted protesters who have donned the yellow vests used in France\u201d.\nHe said it was a matter for the Met rather than parliamentary authorities as it had happened in the street, but added: \u201cFemale members, and in a number of cases I\u2019m advised, female journalists have been subjected to aggressive protest and what many would regard as harassment. I can assure the House that I am keeping a close eye on events and I will speak to those who advise me about these matters.\u201d\nDuring the BBC interview, Soubry broke off from answering questions to tell the presenter Simon McCoy: \u201cI do object to being called a Nazi actually. I\u2019m sorry but I just think this is astonishing.\u201d\nThe abuse continued as Soubry was interviewed by the Sky News presenter Kay Burley, with chants of \u201cliar, liar\u201d heard throughout the live broadcast.\nSoubry told Burley: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with people demonstrating and making their views heard. I have a real problem with people who call me a traitor, or \u2018Soubry, you Nazi\u2019. That is a criminal offence and I\u2019m a criminal barrister.\n\u201cI\u2019m told that we should get used to it, but we shouldn\u2019t have to. Apparently it\u2019s democracy in action and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] believe that no offences are being committed.\u201d\nIn a later tweet, Soubry said: \u201cApparently MPs and politicians are meant to accept it as part of the democratic process. I fail to see why journalists and technicians should be subjected to the same abuse & intimidation as the police stand by and do nothing. They tried to stop me getting into parliament.\u201d\nThe Guardian columnist Owen Jones was accosted by a group outside parliament earlier on Monday, with some wearing union flags. He shared a video of his encounter on Twitter, where they could be heard calling him a \u201ctraitor\u201d a \u201chorrible little man\u201d and accusing him of writing \u201cfake news\u201d.\nMany of the incidents have been carried out by the same small group of protesters wearing yellow hi-vis jackets, modelled on the French gilets jaunes movements, who like to livestream their actions on Facebook. They have also blocked Westminster Bridge and harassed other politicians and journalists, including shouting racist and sexist abuse at a Sky News team.\nA key member of the group is James Goddard, who identified himself as the person filming the first abuse of Soubry. Goddard is a supporter of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and has posted anti-Muslim messages on the social media site Gab, which is popular with far-right users.",

He had been led into the courtroom in handcuffs, which were later removed.\n\u201cI have always acted with integrity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in my several-decade professional career. I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,\u201d the 64-year-old, whose hair was greying at the roots, told a packed courtroom.\nHe added: \u201cContrary to the accusations made by the prosecutors, I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed.\u201d\nHis lawyer had demanded the court justify his client\u2019s continued detention in connection with a case that has shaken the Japanese carmaker\u2019s alliance with Renault and prompted criticism of Japan\u2019s treatment of suspects.\nGhosn was first arrested on 19 November and later charged on suspicion of under-reporting his salary by 5bn yen ($44m) over five years until 2016 \u2013 allegedly to avoid accusations from Nissan staff that he was overpaid. He has consistently denied the allegations.\nHe has since been twice rearrested \u2013 but not charged \u2013 over allegations that he continued to file false pay reports and had transferred personal investment losses of 1.85bn yen to Nissan.\nTuesday\u2019s hearing, a right granted to suspects by Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, does not mark the official start of Ghosn\u2019s trial, nor will it have an impact on his case, according to legal experts.\nHis lengthy stay in a tiny, freezing cell at the Tokyo detention centre has drawn international criticism of Japan\u2019s \u201chostage justice\u201d, which allows prosecutors to re-arrest suspects several times over different allegations and to question them for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present.\nGhosn\u2019s courtroom appearance attracted huge media attention, with cameras ranged along the streets to capture his departure from the detention centre and arrival at court. More than 1,000 people had queued outside the courtroom to draw lots for the 14 seats in the public gallery.\nHis latest period of detention expires on Friday.\nThe Frenchman, who was born in Brazil and is of Lebanese descent, was once hailed as Nissan\u2019s saviour for masterminding its stunning turnaround in the late 1990s and for forging a three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors.\nHe was sacked as chairman of Nissan \u2013 which has yet to appoint a permanent replacement \u2013 soon after his arrest but kept on as head of Renault.\nThe scandal has exposed differences between the French carmaker and its partners in Japan over Ghosn\u2019s alleged conduct that some industry observers say could threaten the alliance.\nBut in an interview with Agence France-Presse on the eve of the hearing, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, dismissed speculation that the scandal risked destroying the alliance. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in danger at all,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "The Derbyshire town, Dennis Skinner\u2019s constituency, voted to leave by over 70% \u2013 and has had no change of heart\nWalking into the debating hall at a school in Bolsover during the EU referendum campaign, Kate Godfrey couldn\u2019t quite believe her eyes. On the front row, ahead of the sixth-formers she had come to address in her role as east Midlands field manager for Britain Stronger in Europe, were five teachers wearing green ties advertising the Grassroots Out campaign.\n\u201cWe lost that school years before I walked in,\u201d she said last week. \u201cGenerally, young people nationally were backing remain 80-90%. At the end of that debate, 96% of the students said they would vote leave if they were old enough.\u201d\nWhen the referendum results rolled in, Godfrey\u2019s only surprise was that as many as 29.6% of the electorate in Bolsover plumped for remain. Cameron Mitchell wasn\u2019t at Godfrey\u2019s debate: he went to a different sixth form. But he has no doubt how he would have voted had his 18th birthday been just a few weeks earlier. \u201cLeave,\u201d said the now 20-year-old, shortly after waking up from a lunchtime nap following a very early shift at Tesco. \u201cI did think I should have had a vote then, but a second referendum would be bad for democracy, especially around here. They\u2019ve already lost trust in politicians after all the chaos that happened in the 80s.\u201d\n\u201cHere\u201d is Shirebrook, a former pit village five miles south-east of Bolsover, a market town famed for its allegedly haunted castle \u2013 as well as its cantankerous Beast, Dennis Skinner, MP since 1970. The main colliery, which employed more than 2,000 men in its heyday, closed in 1993. The mine shaft was filled in and Sports Direct, the bullish discount retailer, plonked its 75,000 sq metre (800,000 sq ft) headquarters on the site. Mitchell worked there when he was 16. Most young people in Shirebrook have at least had a holiday job in the gargantuan warehouse, where a Guardian investigation in 2015 revealed workers were toiling for effectively less than the minimum wage.\nIn the 13 years since Sports Direct moved in, thousands of eastern European people followed, taking up insecure agency jobs. Old miners moved out, their homes snapped up and then carved up by landlords sensing a quick buck. Bedrooms were divided in two by sheets of cardboard, sellotape on windows marking which half of the window belonged to which tenant. Living rooms became sleeping quarters, forcing new residents out into local parks to do their socialising, drinking cans of Tyskie and \u017bubr that had ousted stout and bitter from the corner shop.\nIt has led to a \u201cdivided community\u201d, believes Mitchell, who works 25-30 hours a week at Tesco, where he is a union steward, and is studying for a degree in sports coaching and development. \u201cNow, I go out with a Polish girl personally and my best friend is Polish, but there has been an integration problem because there\u2019s such a large amount of migrants, they\u2019ve got their own shops where they speak Polish, they\u2019ve got their own little communities and there\u2019s this divide. In many ways, I think that\u2019s what Thatcher wanted right from the beginning. She wanted to divide and conquer, and she\u2019s been able to do it through European Union policy,\u201d he said.\nSelling hot dogs outside Sports Direct last week, 27-year-old Chris Handley said his girlfriend used to work inside and voted leave partly as a result of her experience: \u201cShe struggled with work because her colleagues were from eastern Europe and she felt pushed out as a result.\u201d\nAlong with Mitchell, Ashley Taylor, 23, is one of the youth officers of Bolsover constituency Labour party. A landscape architect, he voted remain in the referendum but has now changed his mind. \u201cI would vote to leave now because the way the EU has treated the UK on its exit has opened my eyes up a little bit. I\u2019ve seen what they have been doing to other countries, particularly Greece,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Labour party member with Jeremy Corbyn at the helm, I believe in socialist values and I believe we could generally achieve more nationally under him than we could in the EU.\u201d\nHe is against a second referendum: \u201cWe\u2019re already in a situation where domestic policies have been totally forgotten about because of Brexit. I don\u2019t believe a second referendum would solve homelessness on our streets or improve our NHS.\u2019\u201d\nIt is that sort of talk which makes Alan Gascoyne want to wring some young necks. A former miner down Shirebrook pit, the 63-year-old is now secretary of the Miners Welfare, a community centre and charity in the town. He has been listening to Naomi Crew, the 26-year-old barmaid at the Welfare, explain why she would probably have voted leave, had she actually turned out in the referendum. \u201cPeople my age, people born after 1990, don\u2019t know what it was like round here once \u2013 the Shirebrook Alan talks about, when people looked out for each other and the pits were still open and acted like glue for our community. We\u2019ve never known it stitched together like that,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe Shirebrook people used to look out for each other, but now it\u2019s every man for himself.\u201d\nGascoyne is similarly dismayed at the rapidly diminishing Labour vote in the area. Skinner, a lifelong Eurosceptic who announced his plan to vote for Brexit in the Morning Star, has seen his majority slashed to 5,288 from 27,149 in 1997.\nThe generational ties are breaking, sighed Gascoyne. \u201cIt was always the case that you voted how your dad voted and he voted how his dad voted. In one of the last elections my daughter rang me up and said, Dad, I\u2019m thinking of voting Lib Dem. I said fine, but don\u2019t show your face around our house any more.\u201d He laments the lack of political education among many young people. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that it was Labour that founded the NHS and that it is the EU which has given them many of their employment rights. They think they\u2019ve just dropped from the sky.\u201d\nMany young people the Guardian meets in this large constituency just aren\u2019t bothered: \u201cDoesn\u2019t make a difference to me, duck.\u201d But Brexit will change Bolsover. Its biggest employer is already making contingencies for life outside the EU. Foreseeing a recruitment problem when the ready supply of young eastern Europeans is cut off, Sports Direct has been investing in some \u201cpartial automation for the Shirebrook warehouse operations\u201d on internet fulfilment orders. This, according to the annual report, should \u201cmitigate any potential staffing shortfall after Brexit\u201d. We often hear that no one voted to be made poorer. They probably didn\u2019t vote to lose their jobs to a robot either.\nAverage age: 41\nAverage house price: \u00a3139,198\nPercentage non-UK born: 9%\nMP: Dennis Skinner\nParty: Labour\nMP\u2019s intended vote on May\u2019s deal: Brexiter Skinner is said to have decided not to back the prime minister.\nReferendum result: Leave 70.4%\n The constituency profile at the end of this article was amended on 8 January 2019. An earlier version said the percentage of non-UK born people in Bolsover was 2.6%. That was based on 2016 figures from the Office for National Statistics; 2017\u2019s data puts the figure at around 9%. This has been corrected.",

The Conservative MP Anna Soubry faced chants from protesters calling her a \u201cNazi\u201d and a \u201ctraitor\u201d. Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh said such \u201cvile, misogynist thuggery, abuse and harassment\u201d raised particular worries following the murder of Jo Cox in 2016 by a far-right terrorist.\nThe MPs\u2019 letter to the Met chief, Cressida Dick, reads: \u201cAfter months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far-right and extreme-right connections, which your officers are well aware of, have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting members of parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public.\u201d The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has also urged officers to do more to protect MPs. Scotland Yard has confirmed it is investigating.\nIn parliament today, Labour is poised to support a backbench amendment to prevent a no-deal Brexit. And despite praising Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s portrayal of Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings, Lucy Mangan gives two out of five stars to Brexit: The Uncivil War which has gone to air on Channel 4 overnight. A superficial treatment that puts Cummings too firmly at the centre of everything, Mangan suggests \u2013 \u201cFarage and Banks become cartoonish buffoons instead of dangerous shit-stirrers\u201d. Carole Cadwalladr, who exposed dirty tricks in the leave campaign, takes writer James Graham to task. Meanwhile in Bolsover, a constituency that voted 70% leave, Helen Pidd finds that even some remain voters now support Brexit \u2013 \u201cThe way the EU has treated the UK on its exit has opened my eyes up a little bit,\u201d says one \u2013 while the idea of a second referendum is anathema.\nPrivatisation: no further, say NHS chiefs \u2013 Health service leaders want Theresa May to scrap Conservative legislation that forces the tendering of contracts for care. Their latest long-term plan, which Downing Street has endorsed, warns that the Health and Social Care Act 2012 is damaging the health service and curtailing its improvement. An estimated \u00a38.7bn of the health service budget went to non-NHS providers of care in 2017-18. The NHS bosses say having to obey general competition rules prevents them choosing the best option for spending the \u201cNHS pound\u201d \u2013 Virgin Care has come under heavy criticism for suing the health service after having a bid rejected. Here is what the long-term plan means for patients.\nUber shooter switches plea \u2013 An Uber driver who told police he was compelled to kill by a \u201cdevil figure\u201d on the app has entered guilty pleas to murdering six people in between fares. Defence attorney Eusebio Solis said he had advised Jason Dalton not to plead guilty over the 2016 shooting spree in and around Kalamazoo, Michigan. But Dalton dropped an insanity defence and told the judge: \u201cI\u2019ve wanted this for quite a while.\u201d Solis said: \u201cThere are personal reasons for him. He does not want to put his family through that, or the victims\u2019 families, through the trial. It\u2019s his decision.\u201d The pleas mean he could be sentenced to life without parole.\nDrone users face curbs \u2013 Police will be handed extra powers to combat drones after the mass disruption at Gatwick airport in the run-up to Christmas. Exclusion zones around airports will be extended to about a three-mile radius, and further from runway ends, while police will be able to issue on-the-spot fines. Operators of larger drones will be required to register and take an online drone pilot competency test, and the Home Office is to test the use of counter-drone technology at airports and prisons. Police will be empowered to land, seize and search drones.\nGene pairs \u2013 \u201cYou have to tolerate another animal next to you for an extended period of time and that is not easy.\u201d It might sound to some like the institution of marriage, but the scientist is talking about monogamous species and what makes them stick together. Researchers say they have located the DNA that correlates with certain animals staying paired up to survive and raise offspring while others go their separate ways. \u201cWhat evolution came up with is brilliant,\u201d says Hans Hoffman, a senior author on the paper. \u201cWhen we enter into a pair bond, or have offspring we must take care of, we find it rewarding. The reward system gets hijacked.\u201d Future studies might manipulate genes in animals to see if it makes monogamous species promiscuous and vice versa.\nFrom mugshots to happy snaps \u2013 The privately run Lowdham Grange prison in Nottinghamshire has been praised by inspectors for putting in a photo booth so inmates can take pictures with their visiting families. The Ministry of Justice says helping prisoners keep up family ties leads to lower rates of reoffending. Lowdham Grange, run by Serco, was found to have a high rate of violent incidents, and has put in a hotline where inmates can report violent or antisocial behaviour. \u201cWe did see some innovative practice, and recent improvements needed to be embedded,\u201d said Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons.\nAs Kim Jong-un visits China again and attempts to negotiate a fresh summit with Donald Trump, the Guardian\u2019s Tania Branigan looks at his leadership so far, while Emma Graham-Harrison describes a rare trip to Pyongyang and the humanitarian conditions for ordinary North Koreans.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nWhen I was living in Yemen during the 1980s, someone gave me a battered old map. Information was scarce then, and accurate maps were extremely hard to come by. So departing expatriates tended to pass on any treasures to new arrivals. As he did so, my benefactor paused. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get caught with this.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nMaps, you see, can be dangerous. I think of this when I meet Martin Greenaway, a cartographer at Stanfords in London. Martin is sitting by a couple of computer screens behind a treasure trove of maps: tables covered in vast colourful countries, wall racks groaning with continents, drawers stuffed with cities and mountain ranges. Stanfords has been making maps since the mid-1850s, and has operated from this purpose-built site on London\u2019s Long Acre since 1901. Now it is moving on \u2013 opening new premises in nearby Mercer Walk on 10 January.\nMartin laughs at my Yemen story. \u201cA customer came in and told us how, in the 1970s, he pulled out a 1:50,000 map on a bus and got into trouble with a Spanish secret policeman sitting next to him. Now we sell those same maps to walkers.\u201d\nAnd do many still buy them, I ask. Isn\u2019t the internet killing the paper map?\n\u201cGPS and Google have certainly eaten into the market,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I think paper is going to make a comeback. You just cannot orientate yourself as well with a handheld device.\u201d\nPart of the reason for this possible comeback is that Stanfords can now print any map you need, centred on the place you choose, at a scale that suits your purpose. Martin takes me through the process. \u201cYou know how the hike you want is often at the join between two or more maps? We simply re-centre it and print it for you.\u201d\nI\u2019m reminded of the OS Explorer maps for the Lake District. Four sheets, all of which manage to fail miserably for anyone doing a walk centred on where they meet, roughly Grasmere Common. Now there\u2019s a solution for someone like myself, a folded paper aficionado.\nAnd who buys such maps?\n\u201cAll sorts: a man who was researching an ancient pilgrim footpath in Italy got me to create a whole new map for it; a canoeist doing the Yukon River needed something similar. We get homeowners who are in boundary disputes, pilots \u2013 and a lot of people who can\u2019t get maps in their own country.\u201d\nThat interests me. Many years ago I bought a map in Stanfords for a journey in Sudan. I knew I wouldn\u2019t find anything like it once I was there. Repressive regimes around the world have always wanted to limit cartographic freedom.\nMartin nods. \u201cWe had one man who wanted a street map of Homs in Syria.\u201d\nIn a time when facts are to be treasured, perhaps paper maps have real significance, recording as they do a version of the truth less susceptible to tampering and fakery.\nMartin quickly demonstrates the opportunities and limitations of digital mapping by pulling up all the information he has on Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a. It\u2019s not a lot. \u201cThis is Open Street Map, a website that uses GPS data from contributors\u2019 phones to build maps.\u201d\nHome in on our own current location and the quality is good: every shop and alleyway in London\u2019s Covent Garden is accurately plotted. Move to North Yorkshire and a footpath I\u2019ve recently walked in the Howardian Hills is totally absent.\nNot that paper is infallible. The Ramblers is currently running a volunteer project called Don\u2019t Lose Your Way, the purpose of which is to recover lost rights of way that somehow failed to make it on to maps. Its conservative estimate is that England and Wales are currently missing about 10,000 miles of footpaths on what are intended to be the definitive maps. These are held by all local councils and used by organisations including Ordnance Survey.\nMartin himself clearly delights in the new technology but his love of paper has a practical aspect. \u201cI trained as a pilot when I was a teenager and we still need those paper maps.\u201d\nHe flies a lot in Canada, relishing the remote regions where many lakes remain unnamed, and where if geographical features have a name, they tend towards the bizarre. \u201cMy favourite is an escarpment in Alberta called Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump. Mind you, the UK is pretty good: you\u2019ve got places such as Cold Christmas and Unthank.\u201d To which I can add, from personal experience, Wetwang and Slack Bottom.\nWe go through the process of printing a map: I choose an OS Explorer-style production with my own house bang in the middle. Handy for walks straight from the door. Martin bumps up the scale a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much more you see in a map when the scale is changed from 25,000 to 12,000. There\u2019s no more information \u2013 we can\u2019t add that \u2013 but you do spot things you\u2019d previously missed.\u201d\nWe move to the formidable printing machine and load up with the paper of my choice, then watch as woods, streets and rivers roll out. Next to us is the map of London\u2019s streets that taxi drivers use when learning The Knowledge.\n\u201cPeople still do it?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes. We sell a lot of these.\u201d\nThis formidable task is all the more fascinating at a time when the effects of the digital era on humans\u2019 mental map abilities are becoming apparent. A recent study at the University of Montreal found that some video games that relied on non-spatial strategies could reduce growth in the hippocampus, an all-important region for mental mapping. The dangers of digital maps, it seems, could be inside your own head, rather than in the secret policeman sitting next to you.\nMartin keeps both options. \u201cI always carry a GPS, a paper map and a compass.\u201d\nI ask if he has a favourite map.\n\u201cStanford\u2019s 1871 world map, showing the trade winds.\u201d He fishes out a copy from one of the wall racks and we gaze in wonder at the colours and textures. \u201cIt\u2019s a work of art.\u201d\nIt seems that paper maps will always trump digital in one important respect: beauty.\n Stanfords customised OS 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 scale maps on A1 paper cost from \u00a324.99",

Sure, new Fifa and Call of Duty games will arrive every year and sell predictably well, there\u2019ll probably be a new Assassin\u2019s Creed, and Nintendo will usually deliver a fresh take on Mario, Zelda or Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 but who could have foreseen that 2018 would be obliterated by Fortnite, a colourful cartoon shooter that launched to little fanfare in 2017 but became a global phenomenon over the course of last year? Or that one of 2018\u2019s most critically acclaimed games would be a psychedelic virtual-reality version of 80s obsession, Tetris?\nGames are now almost as varied as the people who play them \u2013 more than two billion of all ages, across the world, playing on phones or PCs or PlayStations. But apart from Rockstar\u2019s western epic Red Dead Redemption 2, whose \u00a3550m opening weekend made the kind of splash seen only every few years, the biggest earners of 2018 were games that have been around for years: Clash Royale and Pok\u00e9mon Go on mobile, League of Legends and Counter-Strike on PC, and the omnipresent Fortnite. The money that these established, evolving mega-games make is astounding: it\u2019s estimated that Fortnite now earns its creator Epic Games about $100m (\u00a378.5m) a week. In terms of revenue, any new game released in 2019 will struggle to compete.\nIf anything stands a chance, though, it\u2019s probably Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, a mobile game from the creators of Pok\u00e9mon Go that will combine JK Rowling\u2019s wizarding world with the real one. As you walk around your neighbourhood, your phone will alert you to traces of magic in random locations. As happened with Pok\u00e9mon Go, expect to see small crowds of Potter-loving millennials gathering in bizarre locations, exchanging knowing nods in between staring at their phones.\nIt\u2019s been more than five years since the current home games consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, were released, which means that new ones are likely to be announced soon (and will probably launch in 2020). This year\u2019s most anticipated console games are the final wave of big hitters. Sony is pretty much certain to finally release The Last of Us: Part 2, a cinematic adventure that combines a post-apocalyptic zombie survival scenario with excellent starring characters (think The Walking Dead, except back when it was good), and Ghost of Tsushima, a stunningly beautiful homage to samurai cinema. On Xbox, Microsoft has tongue-in-cheek superhero action game Crackdown 3. EA\u2019s Anthem, a science-fiction game where players step into mech suits and fight aliens together on gorgeous planets, has people tentatively excited. Kingdom Hearts 3, a long-awaited sequel featuring Disney\u2019s iconic characters and worlds, will dominate in its native Japan.\nOne forthcoming development that could transform how the games industry works is Netflix-style streaming \u2013 though it\u2019s unlikely that this will happen in 2019. Almost every major player in the games space has been experimenting with game-streaming technology, from Microsoft to Ubisoft to Google and Amazon, and their executives love to talk about how it will change the world. Right now, games run on the device you\u2019re playing them on, but game streaming could make it possible to play the same game on a phone, at home on a TV, or at the office on a PC, offloading all the technical heavy lifting to the cloud and saving players from having to buy expensive consoles. Microsoft already runs Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service that gives players a steady stream of new games for a monthly fee, rather than asking them to pay \u00a350 a pop for individual titles.\nBut streaming relies heavily on good internet speeds, and nobody has yet quite solved the problem of lag. Streaming a film uses much less data than streaming a game, and it\u2019s not a huge problem if a streamed film stutters occasionally, but streamed video games need to be totally responsive or they feel horrible to play. And a lot of players simply aren\u2019t ready to abandon their beloved consoles in favour of a new, unproven technology. Many of us have a strong sense of attachment to the physical games and consoles we grew up with, though the younger generation is unlikely to be burdened with such sentimentality. It\u2019s unlikely that 2019 will be the year that streaming technology turns the games industry\u2019s business model upside down, but it will be another step along the way.\nSpeaking of business models, loot boxes, which thanks to government inquiries and media reports are now seen as adjacent to gambling by many, could start to disappear from games this year. They\u2019ve already been rolled back in titles such as Forza 7 and Star Wars Battlefront, and in Belgium, where regulators have been paying close attention, Blizzard removed them from Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm as well. Loot boxes make money \u2013 an awful lot of it, in games such as Fifa Ultimate Team \u2013 but if the negative publicity around these randomised in-game rewards continues, publishers will have to consider other ways of chasing the \u201crecurrent revenues\u201d that swell their coffers.\nWe\u2019re approaching the end of a cycle in video-game world, and it\u2019s coming at a time when the world seems in flux. Brexit threatens to decimate the UK games industry, and worldwide dips in people\u2019s spending are making investors nervous, which is certain to affect video gaming\u2019s behemoth companies and perhaps lead to a couple of years of reduced risk-taking.\nBut every year we\u2019re also seeing new people start to make and play games, and as younger developers and players do things on their own terms and create their own new video-game cultures, the games that emerge from it are becoming ever more interesting.\nThis year I\u2019m looking forward to playing Hypnospace Outlaw, a surreal detective game set in the 1990s internet, and NeoCab, a narrative science fiction game with a lot to say about the evils of the gig economy. In years like this, where blockbuster games are thinner on the ground and the giants of the industry are taking stock, indie producers have more space to shine.",

If you would like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here.\nProducing the Guardian\u2019s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter. Thank you.\nHere we are, then: 2019. In less than three months, the UK is due to leave the EU. Not that you\u2019d know it. The withdrawal deal struck between Theresa May and the EU27 is no closer to winning MPs\u2019 approval than it was before Christmas.\nAfter the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the UK to \u201cget its act together\u201d, the prime minister urged the Commons in her new year address to allow the the country to \u201cturn a corner\u201d by voting through the unpopular deal.\nBut she failed to win any concessions from EU leaders over the Christmas period and, having insisted MPs will vote on the agreement in the week starting 14 January (the UK will be \u201cin uncharted territory\u201d if they reject it, she warned), has now launched a fresh round of appeals to the bloc to cut her some slack on the Irish backstop.\n\u201cFriendly\u201d conversations with, among others, Juncker have so far got her nowhere, with the EU adamant that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement \u201chave been concluded\u201d and the bloc has gone as far as it can in offering reassurances over the backstop.\nGermany and Ireland are doing what they can, but any potential fix they come up with will be limited to tweaks to the political declaration. The EU could perhaps offer an \u201cexchange of letters\u201d confirming its intention to conclude trade talks by 2021, so avoiding the need for the backstop, but whether that will satisfy Tory Brexiters or the DUP, which has ruled out backing the deal, is far from clear.\nLabour, meanwhile, will support a backbench amendment that could severely restrict the government\u2019s taxation powers unless no deal is taken off the table, and could offer a second referendum on an EU deal it renegotiates, as the party leadership came under intense pressure over its Brexit policy.\nOne poll showed Labour support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal, while another survey of party members suggested most believed Jeremy Corbyn should back a second Brexit vote \u2013 90% would opt to remain. So far, however, the Labour leader has remained defiant.\nMeanwhile, Brexit-related economic gloom deepened. Economists predicted GDP growth of just 0.1% for the final quarter of 2018, manufacturers face their biggest worker shortage in 30 years and house prices took a major hit.\nPolice reinforcements are to be deployed to Northern Ireland to deal with the disorder of a possible no-deal Brexit, which universities said would be catastrophic, and the government has signed a \u00a314m contract with a ferry firm that has no ferries and copied its T&Cs from a fast food delivery joint.\nAs the prime minister announced she would chair a new cabinet committee on Brexit planning, including for no deal, the one thing we can be sure of is that it\u2019s going to be a fun-packed few weeks.\nParliament will finally have its delayed vote on the withdrawal agreement on 15 January, government sources have confirmed. Before then, May aims to offer reassurances in three areas: Northern Ireland, the role of parliament in future negotiations and (in written and legal form) the role of EU27 member states.\nThe DUP and hardliner Tory Brexiters will not be convinced, and the EU is unlikely to make any further concessions until MPs have defeated the agreement at least once, as seems almost certain, so as to prevent Brexiters from coming back for yet more.\nIf the margin of the defeat is less than about 100, the government may make a final appeal to the EU27 for help in the unlikely hope it can come back to parliament with a substantively different proposition.\nPressure on May will increase. Labour could table a vote of no confidence, and hard-Brexiters in her cabinet could revolt. Ultimately, she hopes to convince the DUP, Tory hardliners and enough Labour leavers in a second parliamentary vote that the choice is her Brexit, no deal, or no Brexit at all.\nA very heavy defeat on 15 January, or a second defeat, could trigger a crisis. Anything could happen: a mass cabinet walkout; indicative votes; a change of strategy, perhaps towards a permanent customs union; a second referendum, or an election (though the two latter options would mean extending article 50, requiring EU27 agreement).\nNo-deal Brexit lorry rehearsal in Kent \u201ca waste of time\u201d.\nMay will win vote on her deal on 15 January, says Brexit minister.\nMost Tory members would choose no deal over May\u2019s plan.\nChris Patten says UK must have second EU referendum.\nJohn Redwood says UK is losing sight of Brexit benefits.\nNo-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for UK farmers, warns the NFU.\nUK nationals in Italy assured of residency in event of no-deal Brexit.\nPublicity drive to prepare UK public for possible no-deal Brexit.\nSadiq Khan angers Brexiters with pro-EU fireworks display.\nRecord number of Britons seek Irish passports before Brexit.\nIn the Guardian, Anne Perkins says of Channel 4\u2019s Brexit drama The Uncivil War, which focuses on the role of Dominic Cummings, that Brexit was \u201cfuelled by deceit, not one oddball\u201d:\nThe shameless misinformation that Cummings and his associates propagated was infinitely more brazen and dangerous than anything that has gone before \u2026 Their audacity was best summed up in the single, Cummings-crafted message, \u201cTake back control\u201d, implying that control \u2013 sovereignty \u2013 had been frivolously, cravenly surrendered by an effete political class for no discernible reward. The notorious pledge of \u00a3350m a week to the NHS was the symbol of what restored sovereignty would deliver. It was a grossly misleading figure that crowned a campaign based on deceit. No one imagines we live in a world where politicians never dissemble, but nor did we imagine that they painted deliberate untruths on campaign buses.\nSimon Jenkins says MPs should be given a free vote on the deal:\nThere is said to be a majority of MPs against no deal, but that means nothing without a positive alternative. There is none. There is only May\u2019s deal. The Brexiters\u2019 argument that Britain held all the cards was rubbish. Next week\u2019s vote still looks hopeless, but that is because so many MPs will defy their whips. This is a classic case where parliament should rise above party. May should agree with Corbyn to have next week\u2019s vote a free one, and to let conscience divide the house. Parliament is the national interest in conclave. MPs at this time should decide individually, not tribally.\nLabour\u2019s David Lammy on that no-deal Brexit rehearsal (in the end, only 89 trucks showed up):\nThere is no better representation of the sheer absurdity of Brexit than this. 150 lorries driving round a disused airport practising the popular British pastime of queuing, in preparation for an entirely self-inflicted national catastrophe. https://t.co/fjlQ56caAK",

        "content": "Proposals to bar students without three Ds at A-level would hit courses such as nursing and \u2018strike at heart of social mobility\u2019\nThe heads of UK universities have reacted angrily to leaked proposals they say would bar thousands of disadvantaged young people from going to university by preventing them from getting student loans.\nThey also say that if the government goes ahead with rumoured plans to cut tuition fees, undergraduates would experience a poorer quality of education, less mental health support and a smaller choice of degree subjects.\nThe ideas have been leaked from the prime minister\u2019s review of post-18 education, chaired by Philip Augar, a former equities broker, which is expected to report next month. One idea would stop young people qualifying for a loan if they didn\u2019t get three Ds at A-level.\nVice-chancellors argue this would be reducing student numbers \u201cby the back door\u201d, and damaging poorer students in the process. \u201cThis would strike at the heart of social mobility,\u201d says Dominic Shellard, head of De Montfort University, as it would prevent many people from the poorest backgrounds from improving their life chances by studying for a degree.\nLast year nearly 8,000 UK 18-year-olds were accepted to study at university with 3Ds or lower, according to new data released by the admissions service Ucas last month. Universities say these applicants are much more likely to be from poorer families.\nShellard says these students are potentially among the best motivated: \u201cMany students with lower A-level grades go on to do extremely well at university as they feel they\u2019ve got something to prove.\u201d\nOne of the subject areas that could suffer would be nursing. \u201cThere are already 500 nurse vacancies in our local hospitals and there will be far more after Brexit,\u201d says Shellard. \u201cAt a time when we will have skills shortages because of Brexit it seems crazy to be talking about rigging the market even more and reducing our ability to train people.\n\u201cMy fear is that we are going to end up with fewer people going to university, less social inclusion, less diversity, more elitism and a greatly denuded sector.\u201d\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, a thinktank, also believes this would be a \u201ccatastrophic policy\u201d. \u201cIt will hit entrants from the poorest backgrounds disproportionately. You might have missed 3Ds because you\u2019ve been at a poor performing school,\u201d he says.\nWith the Conservatives anxious to regain ground with young voters following Labour\u2019s commitment to abolish tuition fees, universities have long believed that the review is a vehicle for reducing the \u00a39,250 fees cap. But vice-chancellors fear the government is unlikely to plug the resulting gap in funding.\nThe Augar review team is rumoured to be favouring a cut in fees to \u00a36,500 for arts, humanities and social science subjects \u2013 a loss of nearly \u00a33,000 per student for universities. But fees for high-cost subjects that typically lead to higher earnings, including science, engineering and medicine, could increase to up to \u00a313,500.\nAcademics with close links to Westminster have heard that for every \u00a31,000 reduction in fees, the government calculates the sector will lose \u00a31bn. They say reducing fees to \u00a36,500 could mean an \u201ceye-watering\u201d loss of nearly \u00a33bn.\nThe head of a Russell Group university, who asked not to be named, says: \u201cThe bottom line is that has to mean big job losses. You can\u2019t cut \u00a33bn without some really serious consequences.\u201d\nA second Russell Group vice-chancellor agrees: \u201cIf the government bring this in they will see a huge university job losses in the same year as a general election.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make some tough decisions. We won\u2019t close arts and humanities subjects. But we will have to get more students on to those courses to make them viable.\u201d\nUniversities including Cardiff, Reading, Gloucester and Birkbeck have already announced plans to make redundancies this year.\nNick Petford, head of Northampton University, told the Guardian that if fees dropped to \u00a36,500, there was \u201cno way\u201d his university could move forward without \u201csignificant redundancies\u201d.\nNigel Carrington, vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts, one of London\u2019s biggest universities, is angry about the implication that arts disciplines are worth less. \u201cIt is very frustrating and depressing. If the leaks are to be believed, policy is being created based on ignorance or prejudice with no understanding of the importance of world-leading creative education as the foundation for our flourishing creative and cultural sectors.\u201d\nCarrington, whose university is made up of six internationally renowned arts and design colleges, including Central St Martins and the London College of Fashion, says it costs his institution more than \u00a311,500 to deliver the average degree. He says teaching these subjects to the level industry requires needs technical facilities, properly resourced studios and increasingly expensive technology.\n\u201cA fees cut for arts subjects would be terrible for the UK. The creative industries will become even more important if we are to sustain growth after Brexit. And if universities don\u2019t receive enough to run these courses properly, many will be forced to drop them.\u201d\nHillman warns that some universities forced to find savings would slash investment in student mental health, as well as on helping students prepare for the job market. \u201cIn the short term, universities might be able to squeeze these things invisibly \u2013 until they have a spate of student suicides or their employment rate plummets.\u201d",

        "content": "Lessons from those who have overcome trauma are helping pupils confront their own personal challenges\nWhen the IRA bomb exploded, Darren Swift, an army dog handler in Belfast, had several split-second decisions to make. One of his legs had been blown off; the other, along with two fingers, was hanging by a thread.\nHis first instinct was to shoot himself, he now readily admits, but unusually, as he was feeding his dog at the time, he was without a weapon. The second was to rip off his remaining leg to enable him to drag his body more quickly to safety.\nIt is gory, vivid and explicit material to present to a class of 11- and 12-year-olds on a crisp morning in the home counties. But Swift\u2019s story is part of a new project, Making Generation R, where limbless veterans help build resilience in young people.\nThe idea of building resilience \u2013 developing the ability to overcome adversity and recover quickly from challenging situations \u2013 alongside academic learning has come and gone in political importance in the past decade. Ever since the schools minister Nick Gibb described the idea of social and emotional learning as \u201cghastly\u201d in 2007, doubts have been expressed about the value of non-academic education in schools.\nBut the current education secretary, Damian Hinds, has promoted the idea of \u201ccharacter education\u201d, and the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which carries out large-scale research projects aimed at breaking the link between disadvantage and lack of achievement, acknowledges that character and resilience are associated with a range of positive outcomes at school and beyond.\nThe evidence about how these personal characteristics can be developed is mixed. Promising interim results of an EEF project with the London School for Economics, to see how personal, health and social education (PHSE) can be used to improve wellbeing, resilience and motivation, were published at the end of last year.\nFor Peter Leidig, who runs an extensive PHSE programme at Blenheim school, in Epsom, Surrey, any opportunity to give pupils real-life examples of people who have overcome trauma and challenges is a powerful resource, especially at a time when one in eight young people reportedly has mental health concerns.\n\u201cOf course teaching resilience is very difficult,\u201d says Leidig, whose own son was profoundly affected by meeting one of the limbless veterans. \u201cBut there is a dearth of good resources in this area, and giving young people an experience unlike their own can be powerful.\u201d\nThe graphic account of Darren Swift\u2019s injuries is certainly powerful. Reactions from year 8 and 9 pupils at Blenheim veer from concern to open-mouthed fascination as \u201cSwifty\u201d (as he is universally known) walks up to them on his stumps and explains that he went from being 6ft 2in to 4ft 6in in an instant, when a bomb containing semtex, nuts, bolts and rivets was dropped on his head, killing his fellow dog handler instantly.\n\u201cFour days later I woke up in a military hospital and remembered everything,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe next 18 months were spent in a rehabilitation unit and it was only when I decided that I needed to become more independent and bathe myself that I saw my reflection in the mirror for the first time and thought: \u2018What am I going to do now? I used to be a 6ft strapping soldier, now I have a choice to sit on my backside weeping or crack on and get my life back on track.\u2019\u201d\nThat positive attitude took him on a gruelling recovery journey that included a solo trike ride across Iceland, becoming a skydiving champion, taking up snowboarding and effectively sticking two fingers up to people who said \u201cyou can\u2019t do that without legs\u201d.\nBut it was getting involved with the Drive Project, which uses the arts to promote mental health, that took Swift in a new direction and into schools all over the country.\nThe Drive Project\u2019s collaboration with Blesma, the limbless veterans\u2019 charity, involves giving veterans professional training in theatre and storytelling to ensure their sessions have the maximum impact.\nAccording to Blesma\u2019s director of operations, Ian Waller, this is as important for the veterans as for the young people: \u201cOur people spend a lot of time on rehabilitation, focusing in on themselves. But there comes a time when they are ready to look outwards again and want to give back.\n\u201cThis is a great way for them to redevelop a sense of self worth, to tell their story, to say: look I have been in a bad place, I may not have all the answers but I came back,\u201d he says. \u201cThe feedback we get is that the pupils really relate because they are hearing it from people outside school and working it out for themselves.\u201d\nBlesma, which was founded after the first world war, raises funds to ensure the programme is free to schools. More than 23,000 pupils have already taken part, and Making Generation R has a target of reaching a further 30,000 young people by the end of this year.\nThe sessions include opportunities for the pupils to confront their difficult personal issues. In the case of the Blenheim group, body image, social media, bullying and schoolwork came up.\nWorking with the veterans, pupils are encouraged to think about their own feelings and what they perceived as \u201chelpful\u201d and \u201cunhelpful\u201d strategies to deal with emotional reactions. The students we watched chose communication, friends, asking for help and bonding with a pet, as opposed to lying, hiding emotions and self-harming. They are also taught \u201cmindful\u201d breathing and to focus on one positive response.\nMuch of the research on developing resilience emphasises that single interventions such as these will only work in schools if reinforced positively throughout lessons and the school\u2019s culture. But the immediate take-away messages from the pupils are positive. \u201cPeople are worse off then me\u201d, \u201cWe are lucky for what we have\u201d and \u201cLife can change so quickly\u201d were universal responses.\nFor Swifty, the message is clear: \u201cWe are not superheroes, just ordinary people to whom a bad thing happened. I had resilience in me \u2013 I just had to find it. I am not even sure I would go back to my old life now. I am probably more fulfilled today trying to pass this message on.\u201d\nMake Generation R is booking free sessions for schools for the current academic year. It can be contacted through the website",

        "content": "Parts of the NHS are still in the dark ages, technologically speaking,\u201d says Professor Joe Harrison, chief executive of Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS foundation trust. \u201cThere are still sites across the NHS that don\u2019t even have wifi. In certain parts of the NHS we still believe that paper and pen are the way to capture data,\u201d he adds with barely concealed contempt. Harrison worries that the service\u2019s unhappy history with technology, most infamously exemplified by the failure of the \u00a312bn Connecting for Health initiative, a bold attempt by the then Labour government to modernise NHS IT but plagued by cost overruns and scrapped in 2011, has left it poorly placed to benefit from the digital revolution.\nHarrison fervently believes that embracing tech, IT and digital innovation helps patients and staff and improves the quality of care. He appears both baffled and horrified that doctors at outpatient clinics still write notes from the consultation into the patient\u2019s often bulging paper medical record and that hospitals send patients letters to confirm their next appointment. \u201cThe vast majority of people who use tech on a daily basis would be happy to communicate and engage with the NHS in a different way.\u201d\nHarrison unsurprisingly welcomes the NHS long-term plan, launched this week, which spelled out a much more central role for technology in the health service over the next decade. Headline initiatives include rolling out online GP appointments to millions of patients and more people using approved health apps to manage their physical and mental health symptoms. \u201cI am really pleased to see technology and digital innovation feature so prominently,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cThere is so much scope to improve service delivery and patient experience through the use of technology \u2013 it is not a panacea for all things, but there is certainly much more technology can offer us as patients and as professionals.\u201d\nAfter Harrison\u2019s six years at the helm, Milton Keynes, an acute hospital with more than 4,000 staff, serving one of the fastest-growing populations in the country, is now one of the NHS\u2019s most technologically advanced hospitals. It is as close as any NHS trust to becoming what Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary and fellow digital evangelist, wants the entire service to be \u2013 \u201can ecosystem for the best technology available\u201d.\nIt integrates technology into much of what the hospital does, from giving patients wearable technology to monitor their clinical symptoms to booking appointments. Since last year, 300 patients with heart problems wear a wristband that automatically uploads their latest vital signs, such as their pulse, temperature and blood pressure, into their electronic patient record. This saves time, he points out. \u201cThe nurse doesn\u2019t even have to put the cuff on to measure their blood pressure; it\u2019s happening continuously. It\u2019s something a nurse or healthcare support worker doesn\u2019t need to do.\u201dHarrison is looking at expanding this from cardiology into other clinical areas, including diabetes.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about technology replacing the doctor or the nurse. If you take the human interaction out of having to physically enter the readings into the patient\u2019s record, then a valuable, scarce resource has more time to talk to the patient, feel their skin and see how they are.\u201d\nIn April last year Milton Keynes became the first hospital to let patients book their own outpatient appointments online, something that Hancock and his predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, want to see happening everywhere. This ability to arrange consultations directly, using a phone or computer, \u201cis the Ocado or Tesco home delivery of the outpatient world\u201d, jokes Harrison.\nHe sees that facility as potentially only the start of a process of patient empowerment.\u201cThat\u2019s the precursor to enabling that patient to look at their medical record on their phone, thereby making it transportable, and enabling them to go and see any healthcare professional, with their own medical record.\u201d It would mean that any member of staff in the UK could see a patient\u2019s medical record at the push of a button. But, given the NHS\u2019s failure to introduce electronic records before, and with increasingly ageing IT systems, let alone any agreement over the many security and governance issues sharing such sensitive information entails, Harrison comes across as over-optimistic and overambitious. However, within his own organisation, Harrison has started this process. A&E staff sing his praises over e-Care, an electronic patient records system that replaced the paper-based system last May. Until the electronic system was introduced, A&E staff had to track down patients\u2019 paper notes.\nNow, staff can instantly identify any patient who arrives at the emergency department and see what stage they are at in their treatment. And when an A&E arrival is transferred to a specialist ward, their notes go with them \u2013 electronically. This makes everything quicker for patients and staff, says Harrison.\nBut tech isn\u2019t cheap. NHS England\u2019s own estimates put the cost of implementing its digital plans at as much as \u00a313bn. Harrison says that\u2019s a price worth paying and will even help solve the NHS\u2019s biggest problem \u2013 understaffing.\n\u201cA focus on technology has to be our priority, as does the development of our workforce alongside this. Tech can support the improvement of the NHS. [But] it can\u2019t replace our workforce. Can we concentrate on the workforce agenda at the expense of developing tech? Definitely not. We need to do both.\u201d \nCurriculum vitae\nAge 49\nLives Buckinghamshire\nFamily Married, two children\nEducation Merchant Taylor\u2019s secondary school; Open University (MBA)\nCareer 2012\u201319: chief executive, Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS foundation trust; 2010\u201312: chief executive, Bedford Hospital; 2005\u201310: deputy chief executive, North Middlesex Hospital; 2000\u201305: director of performance and planning, University College London Hospital; 1999-2005: general manager, St Bartholomews Hospital, London; 1995-99: general manager, Northwick Park Hospital, London; 1992-95: service manager, Central Middlesex Hospital; 1990-92 \u2013 finance assistant, Central Middlesex Hospital; 1989-90: medical records, Central Middlesex Hospital\nInterests Sport, horseriding, travel",

Others hang out of the doors, but the Kilwa Road heading south towards Mbagala slum is jammed and these diesel-belchers are going nowhere fast.\nOn Bagamoyo Road to the wealthier areas in the north, solo drivers in blacked-out 4x4s sit stationary too \u2013 captive customers for the hawkers who trudge up and down the traffic jams selling charging cables and garish wall clocks, carved wooden animals and plastic skipping ropes. Their metal and glass boxes are expensive and air-conditioned, but they\u2019re still boxes.\nBy 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48.\nGuardian Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda; from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.\nWe'll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi'an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.\nRead more from\u00a0the next 15 megacities\u00a0series here.\nNick Van Mead\nSo far, so normal for a sprawling megalopolis of 6 million with virtually no public transport and only eight lanes of major road heading to and from the centre.\nDar es Salaam, the de facto capital of Tanzania, is one of the fastest growing cities in Africa. Its population has increased eightfold since 1980 and swells by half a million people every year. The latest UN projections anticipate it will become a megacity within seven years as its population passes 10 million, reaching 13.4 million by 2035. A paper by Daniel Hoornweg for the Global Cities Institute forecasts the city could be home to an incredible 73.7 million people by 2100.\nIn 2018, four out of five of its people live in single-storey informal settlements on the sprawling fringes, where the journey to and from the centre regularly takes over two hours. It can be longer if rain turns dirt roads to mud.\nBut Dar es Salaam is pinning its hopes on a solution that could offer a different model for Africa\u2019s megacities, giving them an alternative to a future in thrall to the private car. Unlike many cities on the continent, Dar es Salaam isn\u2019t trying to build a metro. It has chosen a less sexy but cheaper and more achievable route: the bus.\nEven in the middle of the day, traffic frequently grinds to a halt without warning. It is not unusual for cars and minibuses to queue for 20 minutes at a single pinch-point intersection. A lone suburban rail line serves residents in a few areas to the south but is tiny in the context of the wider city. Outside the centre many rely on boda boda motorbike taxis to navigate the narrow side alleys and potholed mud roads that make up much of the metropolis. Their safety record is notorious.\nDar es Salaam\u2019s reliance on four arterial roads \u2013 two lanes each way for the most part, one lane in places \u2013 is a legacy of the colonial government that planned the city at the start of the 20th century for a population of 35,000. Most of the growth is made up of young people arriving from the countryside to find work, and as the population has exploded Dar es Salaam has grown around those four highways. Nearly all the expansion is happening on the periphery, and nearly all is informal and unplanned.\nUntil recently, Morogoro Road, the arterial serving the north-west, was one of the most congested and polluted. \u201cIt was just dalla dallas,\u201d remembers Ulisses Navarro, a consultant on the city\u2019s original Dart bus rapid transit design in 2005, as we squeeze on to a packed bus for the long trip out towards the edge of the city. \u201cThat was the only way for people living out here. It was one of the worst.\u201d\nThe Dart system boasts bus lanes separated from other traffic, mostly in the middle of the road to reduce stoppages. Ticket payment and control takes place at stations rather than on board, while step-free stations and boarding mean the entire route is accessible to people in wheelchairs or with buggies.\nWe get on the first bus fine, but for the return journey have to wait for three buses before there is space to board. You should have seen how bad it was before, says Navarro.\nThe average journey time from the centre to the terminus at Kimara has been slashed from two hours each way to just 45 minutes, according to sustainable transport group the ITDP. That adds up to a saving of around 50 hours a month for the average bus passenger making the full trip. The ITDP awarded the system Africa\u2019s only \u201cgold standard\u201d bus rapid transit (BRT) rating.\n\u201cThe new buses are much, much better,\u201d says Paulas George, a young IT worker waiting at Manzese station. He takes the bus every day and it has cut his journey time by two-thirds. He says it is not perfect though, complaining drivers sometimes turn off the air conditioning to save fuel.\nThat is not the only teething problem. A shortage of buses after the main depot flooded during the 2017 rainy season means the system is carrying 200,000 people a day \u2013 half the expected capacity. Smartcard readers at station entrances aren\u2019t working either, forcing passengers to buy individual paper tickets for every journey. Each is printed with a scannable QR code, but there are no scanners. Station staff stand by the gates and tear tickets as people enter. Lines are long at peak times.\nMorogoro Road was phase I of the BRT project. Phases II and III will install bus lanes along Nyerere Road to the south-west and Kilwa Road to the south. Construction on both routes is due to start imminently. Phase IV, towards Bagamoyo in the north, is in the preliminary design stage.\n\u201cMuch of the city will have access to a world-class transport system within the space of a few years,\u201d says Chris Kost, the ITDP\u2019s Africa director. All phases are being planned to gold standards and, once complete, a third of city residents will be within a 10-minute walk of the BRT network.\nThe ITDP bemoans Africa\u2019s obsession with metros. Lagos in Nigeria \u2013 the largest city in the world without a functioning mass transit system \u2013 has been trying to build a metro since the 1980s. In the latest of many incarnations, the project was supposed to begin operations in 2012 at a cost of $2.4bn (\u00a31.9bn). Six years after the supposed start date, construction is \u201cnowhere near complete\u201d, says Kost.\nAbidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast, began construction of a metro last year. The French-financed and -built line is projected to carry 500,000 passengers a day at a cost of $1.7bn. Dar es Salaam\u2019s bus system, by contrast, has capacity for 400,000 people and cost less than a 10th of that \u2013 about $150m.\nAddis Ababa in Ethiopia opened a Chinese-built and -operated light rail line last year at a cost of $475m. Shenzhen Metro Group has a deal to run it for the first five years.\u201cWith a metro, an international firm will often just parachute in its own system,\u201d says Kost. \u201cBus rapid transit allows existing stakeholders to get involved. That\u2019s what we did in Dar es Salaam and what we\u2019re planning in Nairobi, where the bus bodies will be built in the city and local operators will look after tickets, fare collection and IT. It\u2019s good for the development of the local economy.\u201d\nSo why are these cities choosing the metro over the bus? Karol Zemek, the editor of Metro Report International, says trains can carry far more passengers than buses, have higher speeds, reduce emissions \u2013 and deliver a status boost buses cannot match. \u201cMetro is the top end of mass transit,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to carry large numbers of people you cannot beat it, and moving large numbers of people around the city is crucial for economic growth.\u201d\nKost, though, sees it more as political expediency. \u201cBecause metro systems don\u2019t take up road space and don\u2019t take away from cars then they are politically easier,\u201d he says. \u201cPoliticians see it as a big project with no sacrifices. But what if it never gets built? What if what is built is too expensive and so limited in size it leaves the majority of city residents no better off?\n\u201cIt can be tempting for those in power, but is it really addressing the needs of people of the city? Bus rapid transit has been transformational for Dar es Salaam. For millions of people in African cities, this is their best hope of ever being connected.\u201d\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here",

As Kim arrived in Beijing on Monday for a three-day visit, Chinese media went out of their way to flatter the young leader.\n\u201cThe millennial who commands the wind and clouds has arrived in Beijing,\u201d wrote Liu Hong, the Chinese editor of a Xinhua affiliate, on his public WeChat account. \u201cTo come to China for a heart-to-heart ahead of such momentous change is a sign of the complexity of the situation and the ability of the millennial to seize the moment.\u201d\nOther publications republished Liu\u2019s commentary.\nChinese state media have often highlighted Kim\u2019s age. In 2010, as it became clear Kim would be the successor to his father, Kim Jong-il, People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist party, dedicated a page to Kim, describing him as world\u2019s \u201cthe most extraordinary millennial\u201d. In 2012, a CCTV special on Kim hailed him for bringing in younger officials into his government.\nBut referring to Kim as a millennial, specifically a balinghou, or post-80s, a generation in China who grew up in the relative comfort of China\u2019s reform era, is not entirely complimentary. In China, they are often described as self-indulgent, spoiled, and lacking resilience. Among netizens Kim is often referred to as zuiniudebalinghou or \u201cthe most badass millennial.\u201d\nFor Kim, the emphasis on his youth serves as a veiled insult in a country where the average age of senior officials was 63 in 2012, the most recent leadership transition. Ties between Pyongyang and Beijing, its closest ally, deteriorated after Kim took office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s serving a dual purpose, both to suggest that based on his youth he could be the right kind of reformer, and as a bit of a put-down,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat.\n\u201c[Beijing is] happy to be positive toward Kim and North Korea, as long as they establish a hierarchical relationship. They don\u2019t want to put Kim on equal terms with Xi,\u201d he said.\nKim\u2019s trip to Beijing this week follows three visits to China last year, a sign ties may be improving, but the relationship remains complicated.\n\u201cUnderlying everything is the fact that North Korea resents being so dependent on Beijing and China wishes North Korea would be a more pliable, less provocative vassal state that embraces the Chinese model of economic reform,\u201d Oba said.",

The Wall of Sound tyrant and ex-husband/emotional abuser of Ronnie Spector spectacularly screwed over Darlene Love, singer with the Blossoms, by using her vocals in He\u2019s a Rebel, a hit single for another of his acts, the Crystals. He then promised Love a solo career but sidelined her, all the while keeping her under contract until 1974.\nBasically the best singer in the Supremes (soz, Diana), Florence Ballard was made to leave the band in 1967 after her drinking got out of hand.

The Blues will try to replace him with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, also on loan, and will also attempt to sign a midfielder to replace the supposedly departing Cesc F\u00e0bregas, with Zenit Saint Petersburg\u2019s Leandro Paredes and Cagliari\u2019s \u00a345m-rated 21-year-old Nicol\u00f2 Barella under consideration.\nThey would do well not to move too soon, mind, because having agreed to leave for Monaco and waved a tearful farewell to fans, F\u00e0bregas is still waiting for the Ligue 1 club to agree a fee with Chelsea, leaving the whole business ripe for potential collapse. Like Morata, Tammy Abraham is a Chelsea striker who wants to leave on loan, though his departure is complicated by the fact he is already on loan. With his temporary stay at Championship side Aston Villa going thrillingly well, Abraham is demanding another chance to prove himself in the Premier League.\nAmid rumours of interest from Wolves, the Mirror is reporting that Abraham failed to turn up to training at Villa on Monday, and is hoping to force Chelsea to cancel his loan. Villa have already started looking for a replacement, with their gaze settling on Brentford\u2019s Neal Maupay, who like Abraham has scored 16 goals this season. They could also attempt to snaffle the \u00a310m-rated winger Adam Reach from their former manager Steve Bruce, soon to arrive at Sheffield Wednesday.\nWest Ham want a striker on loan as well, and have taken a fancy to Internazionale\u2019s Gabriel \u2018Gabigol\u2019 Barbosa. Burnley, Cardiff, Newcastle and Fulham are all interested in the Marseille winger Clinton N\u2019Jie, formerly of Tottenham, but Burnley are hedging their bets by also eyeing up Stoke\u2019s James McClean. Fulham also want the Bordeaux right-back Youssouf Sabaly, while Cardiff are hoping to seal an \u00a38.5m deal for Nice midfielder Adrien Tameze in the next few days.\nTalking of Tottenham, Beijing Guoan have offered \u00a311m for their midfielder Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and the club are open to offers for the goal-shy Dutch striker Vincent Janssen. Potentially heading the other way to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is Yannick Carrasco, the Belgian winger currently in China with Dalian Yifang. Arsenal have leapfrogged over Milan in the race for the 25-year-old, but may find the \u00a3170,000-a-week wages he is pocketing in China a little hard to match, particularly if they are also going to sign Barcelona\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez. Bar\u00e7a are willing to let Su\u00e1rez leave on loan, but only if the Gunners agree to pay \u00a320m to keep him come the summer.\nThat move is necessary because of Aaron Ramsey\u2019s imminent departure. Juventus have offered the Welshman \u00a345m over five years in a bid to convince him to head for Turin when his contract expires in the summer, and now \u201cbelieve they have won the race\u201d for the midfielder, says the Mirror. They also want to steal Callum Hudson-Odoi from under the noses of Bayern Munich, though the player is believed to favour a move to Germany. Roma\u2019s Kostas Manolas, one of several centre-backs on Manchester United\u2019s shopping list, has a helpful \u00a330.5m release clause, active this summer, in his contract.",

        "content": "The Premier League side\u2019s youngsters visit the Stadium of Light in the Checkatrade Trophy but Sunderland\u2019s Jack Ross wants to face their north-east rivals in the Premier League\nThe big news on Wearside on Monday revolved around Peter Reid\u2019s hair transplant and the former Sunderland manager\u2019s denial that it was motivated by vanity.\nConsidering Reid\u2019s old team are at home to Newcastle United on Tuesday the amount of coverage commanded by his follicular regrowth might have seemed a little out of proportion but then, as Jack Ross confirms, this derby is not the real thing.\nGranted there will be extra road blocks, an increased police presence and rather steep ticket prices. Yet, as Reid\u2019s latest successor puts it: \u201cThis is not the game everyone wants it to be.\u201d\nInstead it is a Checkatrade Trophy last-16 tie between Sunderland\u2019s first team and a Newcastle Under-21 side coached by Ben Dawson. By coincidence it falls a day short of the one-year anniversary of Peter Beardsley\u2019s suspension as manager of the Tyneside club\u2019s development side while allegations of racism and bullying from junior players are investigated.\nTwelve months on Beardsley, who denies the allegations, remains on \u201cgardening leave\u201d, an internal inquiry is uncompleted and Dawson has done a fine job of nurturing youngsters including the 19-year-old Elias S\u00f8rensen. The Denmark Under-21 international has scored 19 goals for the second-strings this season and, despite recently declining an offer of a \u00a31,500-a-week, three-year contract to replace his current deal which expires in June, he is expected to join a Football League club on loan this month.\nWhile Sunderland\u2019s own contract rebel \u2013 their top scorer Josh Maja, who has rejected a proposed new agreement in the wake of considerable interest from leading clubs \u2013 seems set to be rested, S\u00f8rensen is likely to find himself up against a battle-hardened League One defence as Checkatrade Trophy rules decree EFL clubs must field at least four outfield players with a high percentage of league appearances behind them.\nThere is scope for Newcastle to even things up by fielding up to five professionals aged over 21 \u2013 although no more than two can have made more than 40 first-team appearances \u2013 but Rafael Ben\u00edtez has indicated his side\u2019s Premier League survival struggle will almost certainly militate against that.\n\u201cWe have a lot of [first-team] games,\u201d says Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cWe have to decide what\u2019s most important.\u201d\nIf that surely constitutes doing everything to ensure top-tier status, Ross\u2019s priority is winning automatic promotion from League One. Sunderland stand third, one point behind second-placed Luton Town, with a game in hand. On Saturday Luton visit Wearside.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, the Newcastle tie is far from ideal, it\u2019s a no-win situation for us,\u201d says Ross. \u201cA consequence of our club having suffered two successive relegations is the soreness everyone feels when a fixture like this comes around. The extra motivation for me is to take Sunderland back into this fixture properly.\n\u201cI want to manage this club against Newcastle in a league game, ideally in the Premier League. That\u2019s a task I was given \u2013 and I\u2019ve set myself. I\u2019m not going to dress Tuesday\u2019s tie up as something it\u2019s not.\u201d\nProviding promotion is secured, Ross would also rather like to lead his side out at Wembley and knows only three games stand between Sunderland and a trip to the national stadium in this competition.\n\u201cWembley\u2019s appealing and exciting because of the size of the support we\u2019d bring,\u201d he says. \u201cIdeally we want to get there and win the trophy \u2026 but Saturday\u2019s game against Luton is obviously very important to us and it will influence Tuesday\u2019s team selection.\u201d\nDespite \u00a315 tickets \u2013 up from the \u00a33 charged in previous rounds \u2013 a sizeable crowd is expected at Sunderland\u2019s near-50,000-capacity stadium for the first semi-senior Wear-Tyne derby since March 2016. Somewhat controversially the police advised against Newcastle fans being granted the allocation of 5,000 tickets Checkatrade rules theoretically entitle the visitors to, leaving them with 2,800.\nGiven the 7.45pm kick-off and history of violence scarring past north-east derbies, such caution is perhaps understandable but relations between the two sets of supporters have been infinitely more harmonious since 17 July 2014 when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.\nAll 298 passengers and crew perished, including John Alder and Liam Sweeney, two Newcastle fans en route to their team\u2019s pre-season tour of New Zealand. Within days Sunderland fans had joined Tyneside counterparts in assorted tributes and charity fund-raising initiatives honouring the pair\u2019s memory and there is optimism this entente cordiale will endure.\nNot that Newcastle supporters are likely to refrain from serenading Reid \u2013 or \u201cMonkey Heed\u201d as they used to delight in calling him \u2013 with a new, hair-related, ditty should he make one of his regular trips to the directors\u2019 box on Tuesday night.",

That year\u2019s jump in emissions is the biggest since the bounce back from the recession in 2010. It is the second largest gain in more than two decades.\nCoal plants are shutting down, but electricity demand is growing. Natural-gas fired power emits about half as much carbon as coal but still contributes to climate change. The fossil fuel is replacing most of the coal plants that are closing and also fed most of the higher demand, increasing power-sector climate pollution. Outside of the power sector, transportation, industry and buildings all increased their emissions as well, according to the estimates.\nThe numbers undercut one of the Trump administration\u2019s key defenses for dismissing federal science reports that show rising temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy, kill people and cause more extreme weather. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t believe the findings and his officials have argued they are exaggerated.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, often trumpets declines in greenhouse gases, citing data showing that they fell 2.7% from 2016 to 2017.\nBut the EPA is rescinding Obama-era climate work, including regulations meant to speed a shift from coal. The agency contends that Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is driving energy innovation that could help cut emissions. Energy experts, however, say Trump is doing the opposite by rolling back the rules and policies that could have sped renewable growth and by forgoing new regulations beyond the electricity sector.\nRhodium Group tracks the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The firm found a modest decrease in carbon emissions between 2016 and 2017, in part because of a warmer-than-usual winter that didn\u2019t require as much heating. Since then carbon output has surged.\n\u201cThe tailwinds of Obama administration policy are dissipating,\u201d said Trevor Houser, a partner at the firm. \u201cThis year makes it abundantly clear that energy market trends alone \u2013 the low cost of natural gas, the increasing competitiveness of renewables \u2013 are not enough to deliver sustained declines in US emissions.\u201d\nHouser said the numbers would have been worse without the state and local policies enacted during the past five to 10 years. But that the groundswell of climate commitments by governors and mayors since Trump said he would exit the international Paris climate agreement might not translate into policy for some time, he added. He said those efforts are likely to be significant but not sufficient to meet the levels the US pledged.",

        "content": "This week, the government\u2019s much anticipated NHS long-term plan has finally seen the light of day after months of delay. It talks of investing more in primary, community and mental health care, creating a digital \u201cfront door\u201d to the NHS, reducing the burden of many life-limiting conditions and improving the flow of patients through A&E. These are certainly areas that need a fresh focus, given rising demand and slipping waiting times and standards in recent years.\nIt\u2019s great that the plan will see an extra \u00a32.3bn for mental health. As a GP, around half my consultations are with patients who have mental health problems. Services are at breaking point \u2013 with thresholds to accept referrals so high that often only those in crisis (such as being potentially suicidal) are seen, with limited possibilities for GPs to refer for talking therapies. Around 90% of us GPs feel services for these young people with mental health problems are inadequate. Waiting times for adult talking therapies on the NHS can be as long as two years, leaving patients in limbo and in a revolving door system of GPs, A&E or emergency psychiatry services.\nThe NHS plan promises that 350,000 more children and young people will be treated and similar numbers of adults offered access to talking therapies. But it seems that much of this extra funding will go on services for those in crisis, not ongoing help and support. What patients really need are long-term interventions that the NHS does not have the staff to deliver quickly: one in 10 mental health posts remain unfilled \u2013 2,000 mental health nurses quit every month, and plans to increase numbers have seen little success.\nI would like concrete funding proposals for counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy and other talking therapies so that patients can be supported over years, not just months. The digitalisation of healthcare services through apps and online CBT has its place, but cannot be used alone.\nMy patients Tom, who has anxiety, and Doris, with borderline personality disorder, have tried various medications with little benefit. They attend the practice regularly, often call 111 or the Samaritans, and both have been waiting six months for dialectical behaviour therapy. But our local mental health service does not have the resources to see patients such as these on an ongoing basis \u2013 unless they become suicidal or develop acute psychotic conditions.\nNo one can quibble with the government\u2019s commitment to new \u201csupport teams\u201d in schools to identify and support children with mental health problems earlier. Many schools no longer have dedicated nurses, and health visitor numbers have plummeted, while caseloads rocket, due to cuts to public health. This has left many pupils with complex asthma, epilepsy and other health conditions without access to a school nurse, adding strain for parents and teachers, and leaving GPs like me and other community staff with limited or no access to school nurses.\nRather than new teams, I\u2019d like the government to ringfence public health budgets, so that local authorities can\u2019t use the money for something else. Health visitors are working beyond capacity with complex caseloads (children\u2019s safeguarding, domestic violence and postnatal depression). In many parts of the country they look after many more under-5s than previously or the recommended number, which is a big concern. Sexual health budgets also need realistic scrutiny. Despite escalating demand, cash-strapped local authorities are cutting spending on promoting safe sex to those at risk of sexually transmitted infections.\nBut are we putting the cart before the horse? Where is the plan to recruit and retain our workforce? This is essential to any long-term plans. Many of us have been drawn to the NHS for its varied roles, sense of purpose and a chance to become experts in our fields. But over years of relentless work, with little personal development or pastoral support, we lose many excellent staff along the way.\nYes, I would like to see reduced waiting times in A&E and shorter hospital stays. But this should not be at the cost of \u201ctoo soon\u201d hospital discharges, which have become so common in recent years, with a backdrop of collapsing social care and no intermediate care provision whether in the form of beds or community geriatricians. General practice \u2013 already at capacity \u2013 then becomes the inevitable sponge, which is now saturated.\nThe NHS long-term plan has a lot to deliver, but we need to ensure we are focusing on where the real problems lie within the NHS and how we must resource the solutions. Without this, everything just becomes rhetoric.\u200b\n Zara Aziz is a GP in inner-city Bristol",

The 44-year-old was tasked with leading Stoke to an immediate Premier League return but has won only eight league games out of 26 this season.\n\u201cStoke City have terminated the contract of manager Gary Rowett,\u201d a club statement released on Tuesday said. \u201cMembers of his immediate coaching staff have also left the bet365 Stadium.\n\u201cThe club would like to thank Gary and his staff for their efforts over the past eight months. A new managerial appointment will be made as swiftly as possible but in the meantime Rory Delap, Kevin Russell and Andy Quy will take charge of first-team affairs.\u201d\nA poor start to the season meant Rowett has been unpopular with Stoke fans. Vocal protests erupted during last week\u2019s 2-0 home defeat by Bristol City, in which a \u201cRowett Out\u201d banner was on display. The board decided to act after Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Shrewsbury in the FA Cup, when Stoke supporters\u2019 frustration reached breaking point.\nThe defender Bruno Martins Indi said that anger in the stands was having a negative effect. \u201cOf course it is affecting the players,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are shouting the football is shit, the football is shit. But what is going to help? what is going to help, tell me? It is not helping us, but I understand the frustration. I am frustrated as well that we don\u2019t get to top six during the season.\u201d\nRowett is the third Stoke manager to leave the club in little over a year, with Mark Hughes sacked at the beginning of January 2018 and Paul Lambert vacating his position after failing to keep the club in the Premier League.\nDavid Moyes is the favourite to succeed Rowett with bookmakers.

        "content": "Poor pitches, poorer opposition and cows on the wicket have made pre-Test games in the Caribbean entirely unpredictable\nFrom Mike Gatting\u2019s shiner to Andrew Flintoff\u2019s pedalo England\u2019s visits to West Indies have rarely been free of memorable incident, with even the humble warm-ups reliably producing drama, interest and controversy. England are due to arrive in Barbados on Friday for their latest tour and it would be no surprise if the first days were to throw up a few dramatic moments \u2013 and perhaps a bit of comedy.\nSo intriguing have previous warm-ups been that on the one vaguely recent occasion when they were not particularly compelling, the lack of interest was itself interesting. That was in 1990, when England prepared for a Test series against a side packed with fast bowlers and exclusively right-handed batsmen with a series of games against teams stuffed with spinners and southpaws.\nNearly 60% of the bowling they faced before the international action started was slow, though it was not obvious whether this was to prevent England honing the most useful batting skills or to make them look better than they were in the hope of selling more tickets for a Test series that might be competitive.\n\u201cFour years ago England were blitzed into submission, even before the first horrible Test in Jamaica, by a combination of quick bowling, poor pitches and non-existent practice facilities,\u201d Mike Selvey wrote in the Guardian. \u201cThis time the West Indies board, mindful as much of the need to market the series and of the potential English whinge factor, has bent over backwards to accommodate. [But] the tourists look as ill-prepared for the first Test as they were in 1986. It has just been less painful.\u201d\nThe 1986 tour was perhaps the apogee of comedic preparations. There were terrible performances with Matthew Engel suggesting that their \u201copening game, against the Windwards, looks nice and gentle\u201d and then watching England lose it by seven wickets.\nPreparations for the second game, against the Leeward Islands, were hampered when \u201cpractice had to be scrapped because a herd of cows had chosen to wander over the only available wicket\u201d and with the ground softened by rain it was some time before \u201cthe hoof holes were repaired\u201d.\nThey then very nearly lost to the Leewards, with seven batsmen dismissed in single figures and England 22 runs from victory with two wickets remaining when the game ended. \u201cEngland left for Jamaica looking every bit as silly as they did when they arrived from St Vincent,\u201d wrote Engel.\nBruce French, England\u2019s back-up wicketkeeper, had to miss that game after being bitten by a dog while jogging (the dog, which had apparently done that kind of thing before, was put down). \u201cThis tour,\u201d Engel surmised, \u201cis starting to feel a little shambolic.\u201d\nThe following year French went on the tour of Pakistan, got hit on the head by a ball thrown by a spectator, was hit by a car on his way to hospital and then, on arriving, walked into a light fitting.\nThe most famous of England\u2019s warm-up woes came in 1994, the tour that would include Brian Lara\u2019s triple ton but that started with Chris Lewis coming down for breakfast on the morning after their arrival with his head freshly shaved, spending the day practising without a hat and ending up with sunstroke, ruling him out of the tour-opening match against an Antigua XI.\n\u201cThe funny thing was, he\u2019d got Devon Malcolm to shave his head for him,\u201d Keith Fletcher told the Guardian. \u201cDevon\u2019s blind as a bat anyway, so Chris had all these little bits of toilet paper stuck all over his head where Devon had nicked him. My initial reaction when I saw him wasn\u2019t to worry whether he might get sunstroke, it was to laugh.\u201d\nIn the Guardian Selvey described \u201ca tour whose tide has been going out so far and fast it might be Weston-super-Mare rather than the Caribbean\u201d, on which \u201cEngland\u2019s batsmen plumbed depths that make the Puerto Rican trench seem like a sandy ripple on Grande Anse beach\u201d \u2013 and that was before the Tests began and England emphatically lost the first three. In the last of those, set an achievable target of 194, they were bowled out for 46.\nFour years later England\u2019s first warm-up against Jamaica was played on what Mike Atherton raged was \u201ca substandard pitch for a first-class game\u201a\u201d and produced, in the words of Selvey, \u201cnot so much a gentle entry into the Caribbean tour as a rite of passage: like circumcision or body piercing, something that has to be done with the hope that not too much pain is inflicted on the way\u201d.\nThe outfield grass was so long that it \u201cmight have passed for golf-course rough at the US Open but was inappropriate for a cricket match\u201d. David Lloyd, the England coach, decided it was worth having a word with the groundsman. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you lower your mower blades?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy mower,\u201d the man replied, gnomically, \u201cis metric.\u201d When England returned to Jamaica for the first Test, the pitch was so poor the match was abandoned after 56 minutes.\nWhen England last visited, in 2015, they scheduled two warm-up games, both against a St Kitts Invitational XI. The first was so one-sided \u2013 the hosts were bowled out for 59 in their first innings and reduced to 24 for six in their second, leading the Guardian to call it \u201can utterly meaningless contest\u201d \u2013 that in the second game Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Jonathan Trott and Gary Ballance batted for both teams. This time we called it \u201ca farce of a non-event\u201d.\nNext Tuesday England will play the first of their two warm-up matches, both against a West Indies Board XI in Barbados.

A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the Avon via the great Roman drain.\nWhen harnessed and converted, the abbey says it could potentially produce 1.5MW of continuous energy to support a 200kW ground-source heat pump system.\nIsoenergy, a renewable energy company, will be exploring the great Roman drain to plan how to install heat exchangers in the structure as part of the abbey\u2019s \u00a319.3m Footprint refurbishment project.\nAlix Gilmer, Footprint\u2019s project director, said: \u201cThe abbey\u2019s Victorian heating system is sadly outdated, inefficient and expensive to maintain. This combined with the work we\u2019re doing as part of our Footprint project to repair the abbey\u2019s collapsing floor makes this the ideal time for us to install a new underfloor heating system and is a truly exciting way of using Bath\u2019s most famous resource to create sustainable energy.\u201d\nEdward Levien, commercial director of Isoenergy, added: \u201cThe drain survey marks the first practical step in installing what is one of the world\u2019s first hot spring heating systems. Our engineers will be taking measurements and planning how the heat exchangers will be installed in the great Roman drain beneath York Street so work can be carried out with minimal disruption to the drain and the road above.\u201d",

        "content": "Madeline Linford, first editor of the Manchester Guardian women\u2019s page and subsequent features and pictures editor was the only female editor at the paper for nearly 25 years\nMadeline Linford is the only woman pictured with her editorial colleagues in the 1921 centenary staff album. She had joined the paper eight years before as an assistant in the advertising department moving on to become a secretary for News editor WP Crozier. It was Crozier (third from right in the front row) who spotted her journalistic potential. She wrote film and theatre reviews for the newspaper from February 1917. As was the tradition of the time, her articles had no byline, just initials at the end (M.A.L.).\nIn 1919 she made the move from administration to journalism. She travelled alone to post-war Europe to see how the money the paper had raised for the Society of Friends Mission was being spent in France, Austria and Poland in the midst of war with Russia. When Mary Stott, women\u2019s editor from 1957-1972, interviewed Linford in 1971 she recalled the long train journeys in dangerous conditions with little food and heating. During an 11 hour journey to Warsaw she was locked in a first class compartment with one man, \u201cIt never occurred to me to be nervous either for my virtue, which didn\u2019t matter all that much, or of the fact that I was carrying a good deal of money on me which would have been a fortune in Polish currency at the time\u201d.\nHer intelligent and insightful reports into the effects of war were published in the paper. Mary Crozier (daughter of CP) noted in interview for the GNM archive oral history project that her father was impressed by her \u201cvery brilliant articles\u201d covering famine and a typhus epidemic in Poland. As a result she was sent on a second trip to Germany, Austria and Poland and although this time CP Scott arranged a chaperone and insured her for \u00a32,000 against catching typhus she was still paid her secretarial wage.\nOn her return she joined the editorial staff and covered education and community stories along with reviews.\nHer career progressed in 1922 when she was asked to set up and edit a new section of the paper \u201cMainly for women\u201d. Linford was aware that although advertisers would like the idea she noted, in an article in 1963, that \u201cwomen\u2019s pages were not well thought of by serious journalists.\u201d Her brief from CP Scott was that \u201cthe page must be readable, varied and aimed at the intelligent woman\u201d. To that end she was keen to keep a high standard of writing and encouraged established women\u2019s writers such as Helena Swanwick and Evelyn Sharp to contribute articles along with new ones including Winifred Holtby and Vera Brittain. \u201cSo into an uncharted sea, with a young and very nervous pilot, the Women\u2019s page set forth. From the beginning I was lucky in the intelligent woman not only apparently read it but was also anxious to maintain her standards by its own efforts. Possibly it supplied a platform, dignified, yet light-hearted which she could not find elsewhere.\u201d\nMadeline Linford edited the Women\u2019s page for 17 years with a great deal of independence. No one else saw the copy before it was set in type, \u201c I don\u2019t think they read it\u201d. She recalled a headline being changed only once.\nIn addition to her work for the Manchester Guardian, Madeline Linford wrote a biography on pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and a number of novels in the 1920s.\nThe Women\u2019s page was suspended in 1939 with the outbreak of the second world war, one of the many cuts due to paper rationing. Linford joined the Women\u2019s Royal Voluntary Service and ran a civil defence post between 12-4pm and then did a night shift on the newspaper as picture editor. In 1944 CP Crozier died. In a letter to his widow, held in the GNM archive, she praises the editor who recognised her abilities and encouraged her move into journalism: \u201cI shall always remember him as the finest of characters I have ever met, kind, very wise and extraordinarily modest about his great abilities.\u201d\nShe remained in charge of pictures and also back page features until she retired in 1953. She continued to write occasional articles.\nMadeline Linford died in 1975 at the age of 80. Her obituary hails her as \u201cone of the most remarkable newspaper women of her time.\u201d\nMadeline Linford is one of six women featured in the Women who shaped Manchester at the John Rylands Library.

According to analysis from the economic firm Rhodium Group, carbon emissions rose by 3.4% in 2018, the biggest rise since the bounce back from recession in 2010 and the second largest annual gain in more than two decades, despite an ongoing shift from coal to natural gas-fired power.\nExplosive warming.

Vice-president Mike Pence has said Trump is still contemplating whether to declare a national emergency to force through his plan for a wall, while White House lawyers review whether he has the power to do so.\nPolitical impasse. Pence said on Monday that shutdown negotiations between Democrats and the White House over the weekend had been \u201cproductive\u201d, but a Democratic aide told the Guardian no progress had been made.\nThe new Republican governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, will be sworn in on Tuesday after winning a contentious, racially charged election race against Democrat Andrew Gillum. But despite tacking close to Trump during the midterm contest, DeSantis has since picked at least two Democrats for prominent administration positions, apparently sticking to his campaign promise to embrace bipartisanship in the nation\u2019s third most populous state.\nClimate change.

        "content": "Surprise increase after sluggish year comes despite uncertainty over Brexit\nUK house prices unexpectedly rose at the fastest monthly rate in almost two years in December, according to Halifax, despite warnings over the potential impact of Brexit for the year ahead.\nHalifax, one of Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders, said the average cost of a home rose by 2.2% compared with November. This outstripped all forecasts in a poll of economists by Reuters, in a surprise sign of strength for the economy with less than 90 days before the UK is expected to leave the EU.\nHowever, the figures come after a sluggish year for house price inflation, against a backdrop of heightened political uncertainty and following years of rising prices that have reduced the affordability of properties. On an annual basis, house prices rose by 1.3% in the three months to December, marking the weakest year since 2012.\nAnalysts warned house price growth would be restrained in 2019 after a decade of weak wage rises, as well as the risk of a property slump triggered by a no-deal Brexit.\nHansen Lu, a property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith prices so high relative to incomes, many buyers have been priced out of being able to purchase a home.\u201d\nThe latest snapshot of the property market came as a surprise after a conflicting report from Nationwide, which suggested house price growth was 0.5% in December \u2013 the slowest annual rate since February 2013.\nAnalysts said the two barometers of house price inflation, which are based on each lender\u2019s differing mortgage approval figures, can be volatile. Low numbers of property transactions, which have declined amid fears over Brexit, may also have had an influence, they added.\nJeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: \u201cAt first glance, the Halifax numbers are really positive as they reflect a time of particular political uncertainty and the height of Brexit turmoil.\n\u201cBut when taken with the recent fall in transactions, it is clear that the increase has more to do with a shortage of stock rather than a bounce-back in the market generally.\u201d\nThe average cost of a house in Britain is \u00a3229,729, according to Halifax, although there are significant differences across the country in house price growth. Property values in London and the south-east have either fallen or barely risen, while house price inflation has increased sharply in other parts of the country, including the midlands and the north-west of England.\nRussell Galley, a managing director at Halifax, said he expected annual house price growth would remain stable between 2% and 4% this year, although warned this would depend on the Brexit outcome.",

Director Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 previous biggest film was The Lobster, which achieved a lifetime total of \u00a31.52m.\nThe big question is whether The Favourite can match the giant numbers achieved by Darkest Hour (\u00a324.1m) and Three Billboards (\u00a315.2m).\nThe latter title began with \u00a32.17m (\u00a32.36m including previews), so The Favourite is encouragingly ahead of the pace.

The Favourite benefits from must-see cachet plus support for national treasure in waiting Olivia Colman, but its appeal to fans of The King\u2019s Speech is moot.\nDespite its strong opening, The Favourite failed to dislodge Mary Poppins Returns from the top spot. The magical-nanny sequel dropped 40% from the previous session, and has now grossed \u00a334.3m after 17 days. That number makes it the eighth-highest-grossing release of 2018, and it looks set to climb higher.\nThe new film from Robert Zemeckis landed outside the Top 10 with a disappointing \u00a3145,000 from 328 cinemas (\u00a3242,000 including takings on 1-3 January). Welcome to Marwen stars Steve Carell as an artist who, after a vicious beating, retreats into a fantasy world, creating a small-scale second world war-era Belgian town in his back yard and populating it with dolls. Given a production budget estimated at up to $50m, Welcome to Marwen has already been declared a big cash loser for backers Universal, with losses up to $60m including marketing costs.\nThe takeaway from Welcome to Marwen is that the storyline needed to be realised as a modestly budgeted arthouse film, rather than the CGI-heavy production delivered by Zemeckis. The story was previously told in acclaimed 2010 documentary Marwencol.\nAnother week, and another stunning result for Bohemian Rhapsody, which rises 10% from the previous session. This is on top of a 58% rise for the Freddie Mercury biopic last time around. The film grossed \u00a3726,000 at the weekend, pushing its tally so far to \u00a348.4m.\nWins for best picture and best actor in the Golden Globes drama category on Sunday should help sustain Bohemian Rhapsody in the run-up to the Baftas and Oscars. The film enjoys a strong IMDb user rating of 8.3/10, plus a weaker Metacritic score of 49/100, indicating a large disparity between the audience and critical opinion on this title.\nThe box office summary for 2018 shows that a weak December took the shine off what had been shaping up to be a strong year. November ended with box office 3% ahead of 2017 for the same 11-month period. But December eroded that advantage, and box office for the whole of last year was essentially flat compared with 2017.\nAdmissions data \u2013 the number of tickets sold \u2013 is calculated separately and takes longer to tabulate. When these numbers arrive, 2018 is expected to show a rise on 2017. If box office is flat and admissions rose, the logical conclusion is that cinema ticket prices fell slightly in 2018, thanks to the growing popularity of unlimited-use loyalty cards and two-for-one promotions. Vue has also been engaging in price discounting at many of its sites.\nFor the 4-6 January weekend, box office is 2% up on the equivalent session from 2018. Cinema bookers now have hopes pinned on the arrival this week of awards contenders Colette, Stan and Ollie and The Front Runner, plus Kevin Hart/Bryan Cranston comedy The Upside, a remake of the French hit The Intouchables.\n1.

        "content": "It is a stage sensation in France \u2013 not to mention Kazakhstan and Korea \u2013 but Notre Dame de Paris was panned by critics when it first hit London. Now it\u2019s back, in the original French\nEarly on in Victor Hugo\u2019s tragic novel Notre Dame de Paris, the poet Gringoire proudly presents his latest play to the public and finds it rudely rejected. In a case of life imitating art, a French musical version of Hugo\u2019s epic \u2013 which remains better known as The Hunchback of Notre Dame \u2013 opened in London in 2000 to some of that year\u2019s harshest reviews. The show\u2019s brutal critical reception rested chiefly on its clunky English lyrics (translated from the French) and the use of a prerecorded backing track instead of a live orchestra. The lyricist Luc Plamondon also complained of xenophobia among the hostile reviews.\nYet the production ran for over a year in the West End\u2019s enormous Dominion theatre, with Tina Arena and Dannii Minogue both having stints as Esmeralda. It has been a smash hit elsewhere in Europe, as well as in South Korea and Kazakhstan. Now, as part of its 20th-anniversary tour, the show is returning to London for another run, this time performed in the original French at the Coliseum, with new English surtitles, in a translation by Jeremy Sams that aims to capture the richness of Plamondon\u2019s lyrics. This time, there will also be a live string accompaniment played alongside the prerecorded score. The show will hope to enjoy a boost from the BBC\u2019s popular new TV adaptation of Hugo\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables, starring Dominic West, as well as the ongoing success of Les Mis, the longest-running musical in the West End.\n\u201cWe all know what happened in 2000,\u201d says the actor Richard Charest, who plays Gringoire in the current revival and also appeared in the original London run. \u201cThe critics were really hard at that time.\u201d Also returning from the London production is Daniel Lavoie, who again plays Frollo \u2013 the archdeacon who adopts the hunchback and, like his ward, falls for Esmeralda in Hugo\u2019s story. \u201cI had always dreamed of the West End,\u201d says Lavoie. \u201cI knew the West End was the place to do a musical in the world.\u201d He believes British critics were \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the style of the production. \u201cI don\u2019t think Notre Dame De Paris fits into the class \u2018musical\u2019. It\u2019s more like an opera. Nothing is spoken, everything is sung from beginning to end. The story is told in singing.\u201d\nThe story is also told with a crack squad of back-flipping acrobatic dancers, who dangle from giant, swinging bells, against a stark set comprising huge slabs of stone and buttock-baring gargoyles that are wheeled around the stage. The sense given by the design is of a dystopian world rather than the panoramic view of 15th-century Paris that Hugo details with precision in the novel. But scenes involving persecuted refugees and civil unrest should strike a chord with modern-day French audiences.\nNotre Dame de Paris has just concluded its third consecutive winter run at the cavernous Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Paris, which seats almost 4,000 and once hosted the Eurovision song contest. This is where the production had its premiere in 1998. Composer Richard Cocciante remembers searching for potential backers in Paris and being repeatedly told \u201cthat I was crazy and it would be a disaster\u201d. Certainly, a Quasimodo song-and-dance spectacular sounds like it could rival Springtime for Hitler, the show that is designed to be a surefire disaster in Mel Brooks\u2019s satire The Producers.\nInfluenced by Italian opera and French popular song, Cocciante says he felt no affinity to the tradition of American or British musicals while creating the show. Pop and rock singers are often cast in the major roles of the production rather than classical singers. Notre Dame de Paris was released as a concept album before it was even staged; the first song that Cocciante and Plamondon wrote, Belle, sold 2.5 million copies as a single. Unusually, the lyrics were written (by Plamondon) after the music had been composed rather than vice versa. \u201cWhen you compose the music first,\u201d says Cocciante, \u201cthe impact of the music is primary.\u201d\nCharest says that when Notre Dame de Paris was first put on in 1998, there was a vogue for large-scale musicals in France: it was soon followed by a major staging of Romeo and Juliet. But he believes it is becoming more difficult to originate musicals of that scale today. He and Lavoie are now collaborating on musical projects about both the poet Rimbaud and The Elephant Man.\nAccording to Lavoie, Notre Dame de Paris has been \u201ctightened and tweaked\u201d for this revival, which uses an international cast: the Italian Angelo Del Vecchio plays Quasimodo and the Lebanese actor Hiba Tawaji stars as Esmeralda. Conductor Matthew Brind says it will prove to be a stylistic change for English National Opera when their string players perform alongside the prerecorded score. The lead actors each wear an earpiece that enables them to isolate specific elements of the score \u2013 such as the strings or wind instruments \u2013 at different times throughout the evening.\nAlthough best known as a novelist, Hugo was an important playwright whose drama Hernani is a key text of the romantic movement and sparked riots upon its premiere in 1830, when it was renounced by classicists. His plays are still regularly performed in France but rarely in the UK. In 2016, Bristol Old Vic had a hit with The Grinning Man, a musical version of Hugo\u2019s 1869 novel The Man Who Laughs, which transferred to the West End. But while the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables had a successful premiere in Paris in 1980, it is the stage version of Notre Dame de Paris that continues to ring the bells of French audiences.\nNotre Dame de Paris is at the Coliseum, London, 23-27 January.",

        "content": "Nearly two years after raising the alarm, Human Rights Watch report reveals continued allegations of electric shocks and beatings on boys aged 14 to 17\nKurdish security forces in Erbil are continuing to torture children to confess their involvement with Islamic State, according to allegations in a report released by Human Rights Watch.\nAccording to the organisation, which first raised the alarm about the mistreatment of child detainees by Kurdish security forces nearly two years ago, it has collected claims of the continued regular use of beatings and electric shocks to extract confessions, often prior to trials lasting a handful of minutes.\nThe boys interviewed by the group allege the abuse took place in a detention centre in the Iraqi Kurdistan city in 2017 and 2018, where they were being held without access to a lawyer and without being permitted to read the confessions they say security officers wrote and forced them to sign.\nThe report, published on Tuesday, is based on interviews late last year with 20 boys, aged between 14 and 17, who have been either charged or convicted because of their alleged affiliation with Isis and are being held at the Women and Children\u2019s Reformatory in Erbil.\nThe group also interviewed three boys who had recently been released.\nAt the time of the visit by HRW researchers, 63 children were being held at the facility for alleged terrorism-related offences, including 43 who had been convicted.\nSixteen of the 23 children who were interviewed said that security officers known as Asayish officers had beaten them with plastic pipes, electric cables or rods, while three others said the officers had used electric shocks.\nOthers described being tied into a painful stress position called the \u201cscorpion\u201d for up to two hours. Several boys said the torture continued over consecutive days, and only ended when they confessed.\nFour other boys said Asayish threatened them with torture during interrogation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell us the truth, I will call the guys and they will beat you and break your bones,\u201d a 17-year-old boy recalled his interrogator telling him.\nWhile several of those interviewed said they had joined and worked with Isis, or received religious or military training, only one said that he had participated in fighting against Iraqi military forces.\nOthers, however, insisted that they had no personal involvement, while admitting family members were involved.\nAll but one of the boys interviewed said they eventually confessed.\n\u201cMy confession says that I joined Isis for 16 days, but actually, I didn\u2019t join at all,\u201d one 16-year-old boy told researchers. \u201cI said 16 days to stop the torture.\u201d\nAnother 14-year-old boy told a similar story.\n\u201cFirst they said I should say I was with Isis, so I agreed,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they told me I had to say I worked for Isis for three months. I told them I was not part of Isis, but they said, \u2018No, you have to say it.\u2019\u201d He said that after two hours of interrogation and torture, he agreed.\nAt least five boys said they told an investigative or trial judge that their confession was produced under torture, but that the judges appeared to ignore their statements.\nMost of the children interviewed said they were arrested at checkpoints entering the Kurdistan region, often because their name was on a security list of Isis suspects, while others were arrested at camps for internally displaced people. Many boys believed their name appeared on a security list because a family member was affiliated with Isis, their name was similar to that of another suspect, or people from their village had reported their family because of unrelated grievances.\n\u201cSamir\u201d, whose real name, like those of other boys interviewed, has been withheld by HRW to protect his identity, said that like many others he had been arrested by military forces at a checkpoint.\n\u201cThere were three officers. They bound my hands behind my back, one from above and one below. They beat me with a stick and they gave me five to 10 electric shocks. They put the pads on my left shoulder and on my stomach.\n\u201cAnd while they gave me the shocks, they were beating me with a rod. They did this three days in a row. I was in the room for hours, with them coming in and out and taking breaks. On the third day I confessed. They said to admit to two months with Isis. I did, but it was a lie. I was never with Isis.\u201d\nThe Kurdistan regional government, which has promised in the past to investigate claims of mistreatment, denied the allegations of torture.\nA spokesman for the KRG rejected the HRW report. \u201cThe KRG fully disagrees with the accusation of torture of children Isis detainees,\u201d Dindar Zebari, the region\u2019s coordinator for international advocacy, said in a press statement. \u201cWe have to rehabilitate them, this is the policy of the KRG.\u201d\nJo Becker, children\u2019s rights advocacy director at HRW, said: \u201cNearly two years after the Kurdistan regional government promised to investigate the torture of child detainees, it is still occurring with alarming frequency.\n\u201cThe Kurdistan authorities should immediately end all torture of child detainees and investigate those responsible.\u201d",

Cley Marshes nature reserve on the Norfolk coast is an unusual place for a gig, but the perfect stage for an evening of music inspired by the birds of Orkney.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nCooper, known for the folk-rock of Erland and the Carnival and the more experimental soundscapes of the Magnetic North, migrated to new terrain for his debut solo album Solan Goose, released last year. With its combination of contemporary classical, ambient and electronica, it drew comparisons to Sigur R\u00f3s, \u00d3lafur Arnalds and other music of northerly latitudes, as well as radio play and winning admirers in unexpected places, from literary figures including John Burnside and Robert Macfarlane.\n\u201cWe were a wee bit stressed,\u201d says Cooper to his audience in Cley, after a four-hour drive to the coast, \u201cand all of a sudden the geese flew over and it reminded us why we make music. We want to take you to the Orkney islands, very slowly, very gently.\u201d For all the gentleness, Cooper\u2019s songs are deeply emotional and given lift by three classically trained multi-instrumentalists, particularly the wordless notes delivered by the soaring soprano of Lottie Greenhow.\n\u201cIf it moves me close to the point of tears, I\u2019ve probably achieved what I wanted,\u201d says Cooper when we meet the following week on London\u2019s South Bank, where he\u2019s rehearsing for an appearance with a rather different collaborator, Paul Weller.\nThe \u201crelease\u201d that Cooper finds in his spare electronic and classic \u201cecosystem of music\u201d is matched by the release he finds in natural landscapes: \u201cYou can feel like you\u2019re going to sob and you don\u2019t quite know why.\u201d\nHe has created the music for Nest, a light and sound installation in Waltham Forest\u2019s Lloyd Park which this weekend will mark the opening of the first ever London borough of culture. Cooper\u2019s compositions sample the voices of 1,076 people from local school, community and gospel choirs. One listener praised his samples of birdsong; Cooper was delighted \u2013 they were children impersonating a starling murmuration. \u201cThey pretended to be starlings, singing at random times which is exactly what you want, and very quickly they came together, and sang together, which is scary like Hitchcock,\u201d he laughs.\nSolan Goose was hatched almost by accident. Cooper, born and raised on the archipelago of Orkney, was feeling increasingly stressed and claustrophobic in London. He\u2019d arrive at his studio and turn a noise he had heard \u2013 a jackhammer perhaps \u2013 into a note, \u201ccreate a drone out of it\u201d and then improvise a piano over that. He named each recording after Orcadian dialect for island birds: solan goose (gannet), shalder (oystercatcher), tammie norie (puffin) and, most deliciously, cattie-face (short-eared owl). \u201cIt was a way to pull me home, pull me back to childhood memory. Before I knew it, I had this fully fledged thing,\u201d he says.\nIt wasn\u2019t all quite that simple. In keeping with his commitment to Orkney traditions, Cooper tried putting traditional folk lyrics to his music. It didn\u2019t work. \u201cImagine being on a South Ronaldsay beach and all of a sudden there\u2019s this red balloon popping up in the middle, and you\u2019re no longer looking at the landscape. It was so out of place, it had to go.\u201d\nIn fact, Cooper has found it a relief not to sing during a year of performing the album \u2013 beginning at the Walthamstow Wetlands nature reserve, in London, and taking in summer festivals that included Womad and Port Eliot. \u201cI fell out of joy with my own voice,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a habitual experience when you doubt whether you can sing in the first place.\u201d Instead, he has embraced playing with classically trained musicians.\n\u201cThe classical world can be very intimidating for some, but I remind myself that music is just sounds, just patterns,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to write the simplest thing, trying to do more with fewer notes.\u201d\nCooper has completed the second of a trilogy of albums shaped by Orkney\u2019s air, sea and land, as celebrated by Orkney poet George Mackay Brown. Solan Goose is the air; the sea is next; the record will be released in the spring.\nHe returned to Orkney for inspiration, making recordings \u2013 sonic postcards \u2013 of the reverberations everywhere from beneath the pier to the inside of one of Orkney\u2019s Neolithic chamber tombs. But he made the album in London, which provides a kind of critical distance. \u201cI like to take it [Orkney\u2019s landscape] away in my wee books and boxes and digital and analogue machines. When you listen to something out of context, that\u2019s when you know what to keep and what to discard.\u201d\n  He couldn\u2019t wait to escape the island as a teenager. \u201cNow all I want to do is tell people about Orkney and go back and take people with me,\u201d he says. \u201cNature and Orkney in particular is the one true reset for me. There\u2019s something about the longitude and latitude, the air is different, the light is different. Over this nine-year period I\u2019ve been making music in various guises, it\u2019s the one true thing I constantly go back to.\u201d He pauses and smiles. \u201cI should work for the tourist board.\u201d\nNest, a light and sound installation, is in the grounds of the William Morris Gallery, London, 11-13 January. Erland Cooper is at Trades Club, Hebden Bridge, on 30 March and Milton Court, London, on 16 May. Solan Goose is out now on Phases Records.\nThis article was corrected on 9 January 2019.

They are arguing that the judge was biased in his summing up of the case, that he should have allowed the defendants to make the defence of necessity, and that he got the law wrong about what the offence means.\nThey also claim that the court did not properly check that the attorney general had properly given consent for the terror charge to be levied against peaceful protesters, and that the judge should have ordered disclosure of the materials sent to the attorney general when deciding whether to sign it off.\nRaj Chada, partner at Hodge Jones & Allen, who represents the activists, said: \u201cThe conviction of the Stansted 15 was a travesty of justice that needs correcting in the appeal courts. It is inexplicable how these protesters were charged with this legislation, and even more so that they were found guilty.\n\u201cIt is our strongly held belief that charging them with this offence was an abuse of power by the attorney general and the CPS. It is only right and fitting that this wrongful conviction is overturned.\u201d\nProsecutors had tried to argue that the charge did not amount to a terror offence since it was not detailed in any of the terrorism acts that set out the framework for such crimes. However, subsequent research by the defendants has found that it is included as a \u201cconvention offence\u201d in the 2006 Terrorism Act. As such, it is in fact a crime to \u201cencourage or glorify\u201d the protest by the 15 defendants, Chada said.\nDuring the trial, the defendants had sought to make the case that the charge had been inappropriately brought, but were again denied the opportunity by Judge Christopher Morgan. In a last-ditch move, their legal team had called for the jury to be dismissed after Morgan gave a summing up that they said amounted to a direction to convict.\nHelen Brewer, one of the 15, said: \u201cWe are appealing against our convictions because justice has not been done. Justice will only be done when we are acquitted of a crime that is completely disproportionate to an act of peaceful protest and when the Home Office is held to account for the danger it puts people in every single day \u2013 people who have sought asylum in this country fleeing harm and persecution in the very places the government deports them to.\u201d\nThe group\u2019s conviction followed a peaceful action that stopped a chartered deportation flight from taking off on 28 March 2017. Members of the group cut a hole in the airport\u2019s perimeter fence before rushing on to the apron at Stansted.\nFour protesters arranged themselves around the front landing gear of the aircraft, locking their arms together inside double-layered pipes filled with expanding foam. Further back, a second group of protesters erected a two-metre tripod from scaffolding poles behind the engine on the left wing. One of them perched on top of the makeshift structure, while others locked themselves to the base to prevent it from being moved.\nIn the moments before police arrived, they were able to display banners, including one that said: \u201cNo one is illegal.\u201d\nEleven people who were due to be removed from the UK on the flight are still in the country, with two having been given right to remain.\nAs well as Brewer, Edward Thacker, Benjamin Smoke, Melanie Strickland, Lyndsay Burtonshaw, Laura Clayson, May MacKeith, Melanie Evans, Alistair Tamlit, Nicholas Sigsworth, Emma Hughes, Ruth Potts, Jyotsna Ram, Joseph McGahan, and Nathan Clack, all aged between 27 and 44, are due to be sentenced in the week commencing 4 February.",

        "content": "Leaving EU with no deal would heighten risk of contracts being terminated early\nBT is facing a post-Brexit battle to maintain access to a number of multimillion-pound EU contracts and avoid the premature termination of a \u00a324m deal with the European parliament.\nThe BT Group has won a slew of contracts with the EU\u2019s institutions in the last decade worth more than \u00a3150m.\nBut the potential for the EU to scrap \u201csensitive\u201d contracts such as that struck with BT was raised during a recent meeting of EU officials and senior MEPs discussing Brexit preparations, according to leaked minutes obtained by the Guardian. The risk to the EU in honouring contracts and allowing the BT Group to provide telecommunications services, when the UK is no longer an EU member state, was said to require examination.\nAccording to minutes of the meeting, senior MEPs voiced the view that \u201csensitive services, such as telecommunications, currently provided inter alia by British Telecom, should be given thorough consideration in the framework of procurement by parliament.\u201d The meeting also discussed creating \u201ca full list of contracts with UK-based companies currently in force\u201d.\nThe MEPs concluded that \u201cwhereas ongoing contracts with British companies would be fulfilled as a general rule \u2026 certain particularly sensitive contracts could be terminated prematurely for security reasons\u201d.\nThe meeting between Klaus Welle, the secretary general of the European parliament, and a \u201cBrexit preparedness\u201d working-group of MEPs, also heard that the EU bodies such as the European parliament would not be able to sign off on future contracts with British firms under its procurement rules.\n\u201cAs of the date on which the United Kingdom ceases to be a member state, ie 29 March 2019, parliament will no longer be able to conclude contracts with British companies, noting that this also applied to ongoing calls for tender,\u201d the minutes note.\nIn response to the MEPs, Welle had agreed that \u201cthe question of certain sensitive external service providers to parliament from UK-based companies, inter alia in the field of telecommunications, would be evaluated closely in the light of a new legal situation\u201d, according to the minutes.\nIt was also noted that a no-deal Brexit, under which the UK would leave the EU without the 21-month transition period envisaged in the withdrawal agreement, was a factor that would heighten the risk of contracts being brought to a premature end.\nUnder the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the UK would in effect remain a member state for at least 21 months, and possibly until 2022, allowing it to retain many of the current benefits, although it would lose representation in the EU\u2019s decision-making institutions.\nWelle told the MEPs that the parliament need to examine \u201cexisting contracts with UK-based companies, for which the future status will depend on whether or not specific provisions are adopted as part of the withdrawal agreement\u201d.\nA spokesman for the BT Group said it was in talks with the EU over the contracts. \u201cWe firmly believe that BT should continue to retain its existing EU contracts\u201d, he said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation as it develops as part of our scenario planning for Brexit to ensure we\u2019re prepared for any potential impacts on our business, people and customers.\n\u201cWe are fully engaged with the EU institutions and remain committed to delivering the services we have been contracted for. We believe BT should be able to bid for new EU contracts post-Brexit.\u201d\nIn 2016, BT secured a \u00a349m contract with the European parliament and separately announced two new contracts with the European commission worth \u00a324m to deliver public and private cloud services across 52 major European institutions, agencies and bodies \u2013 including the European parliament, the European council and the European Defence Agency.\nThose deals followed the signing in 2011 of a \u00a3100m contract between BT and the European parliament for the provision of telecommunications services over a period of five years.\nThat contract proved to be a huge boost for BT\u2019s Global Services division, which at one stage reported losses of \u00a3124m. In 2008 the division was at risk of losing 10,000 jobs because of its poor performance but it has subsequently become a major generator of the company\u2019s profits.\nLiberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: \u201cThis is the reality of Brexit. Once you\u2019re out the door, you\u2019re out. There is no special treatment. If Brexit happens, the EU will assess public procurement contracts with UK companies in the same way they do with other third countries.\u201d",

Samadi, who had been in the building shortly before the explosion, was accused of the attack and fled to Europe. He was sentenced to death in absentia.\nWith his wife and teenage son, he had lived in Almere, working as an engineer under the alias Ali Motamed. He was shot in the head at point-blank range by two assailants dressed in black, in what was claimed to have the hallmarks of a contract killing.\n  Two years later, the Iranian activist Ahmad Molla Nissi, 52, who founded an Arab nationalist group seeking an independent state inside Iran, was also shot in the head as he walked through The Hague.\nOn Tuesday, the EU imposed sanctions against two Iranians and the country\u2019s military intelligence service in response to the allegations.\nThe Dutch government said the expulsion in June 2018 of two diplomats from the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands had been in retaliation for the murders and the Iranian ambassador had been summoned at the time.\n Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said it was involved in \u201cintense\u201d efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian \u201cinterference\u201d in Europe.\nLast year, France and Denmark also accused Iran of plotting attacks on European soil, involving a foiled bombing attack that targeted a rally organised by an Iranian opposition group near Paris in June 2018 and the assassination of the exiled leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA), a separatist group with a history of carrying out attacks in Iran.\nThe development has thrown EU-Iran relations into crisis at a time when Brussels is straining to keep alive the accord under which sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for it lowering its nuclear ambitions. Last year, the US president, Donald Trump, pulled out of the agreement, describing it as a \u201crotten deal\u201d.",

Newsom swooped him up in his arms joking, \u201cthis is exactly how this was scripted,\u201d before continuing to read from the teleprompter.\nHe later returned Dutch to the floor, hoping he might leave the stage, but the child stayed wandering around, at one point hiding behind the lectern, to the audible delight of the audience.\nNewsom was able to ad-lib parts of his speech to recognise the stage invader, at one point saying: \u201cWe will support parents \u2026 and they need support, believe me.\u201d\nSolo attempts by another of his sons, seven-year-old Hunter, and his wife, the documentary-maker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, to corral Dutch back to his seat were unsuccessful.

At a time when Monet was painting landscapes, Munch was depicting love and desire but also jealousy, loneliness, anxiety, grief and mental instability \u2013 most memorably in The Scream.\nThe version being displayed at the British Museum is a black and white print, which followed a painting and two drawings of the image, but is the image that was disseminated widely during his lifetime and made him famous.\nDescribing the timeless relevance of The Scream, the exhibition curator, Giulia Bartrum, said: \u201cThe emotional impact is incredibly important. Munch was deeply, deeply aware of mental instability, mental illness, a huge subject at the time, and that\u2019s what he was trying to portray. Anything which tries to express the inner workings of the mind \u2026 has huge resonance today.\u201d\nThe Scream will be shown in the Anxiety and Separation section of the exhibition, which will also include a drawing, Despair, itself associated with Munch\u2019s most famous work. Despair shows a figure turned away to look down into the fjords, which Bartrum said showed \u201cperhaps the moment just before felt he heard the scream pass through nature\u201d.\nIn accompanying text, Munch wrote of the blood red sky, also depicted in The Scream, and how the feeling of the moment resonated around the valley and in his head.\nThe same section also includes two versions of Angst, showing blank white faces streaming down Karl Johans Gate, Oslo\u2019s busiest street, images Bartrum said would resonate with anyone who has felt lonely in London.\nThe exhibition features 83 artworks in all, including 50 prints from Oslo\u2019s Munch museum. Other themes include women, with whom Munch had a series of disastrous relationships, and sickness.\nJealousy depicts the author Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski in the foreground with a woman, presumed to be Dagny Juel, and a man with his back turned behind Przybyszewski. Juel is believed to have had a relationship with Munch before her brief marriage to Przybyszewski.\nThe artist\u2019s mother died from tuberculosis when he was young and his sister also succumbed to the disease. For The Sick Child, three versions of which feature in the show, Bartrum said Munch \u201cdrew out his feelings of emotion at the moment that his sister died\u201d.\nShe said the painting caused a scandal when it was exhibited in Berlin in 1892 because people were unused to such attempts to recreate the pain of the moment of death. The exhibition closed within a week, while at the same time proving popular with the avant-garde.\nThe exhibition also includes matrices used to transfer ink on to paper, never before seen in the UK, and will be displayed alongside the corresponding prints.\nBartrum said that for Munch, who never had children, partly because he feared they would suffer illness, his artwork served as a substitute and, unusually, he sought to collect the stones and wooden blocks, usually held by publishers.\n\u201cCertainly where these matrices were concerned, he behaved as if they were his family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wrote anxious letters about them, always trying to track them down.\u201d\nWhile the themes of Munch\u2019s art resonate because of their timelessness, Bartrum, with an unsubtle nod to Brexit, said how the artist lived his life, during which he travelled to Paris and Berlin, bringing techniques and influences back to Norway, also served as an invaluable lesson in the modern age.\nShe said: \u201cHe was a really cosmopolitan European figure and I think, in this day and age, that is an important message to convey.\u201d\nEdvard Munch: Love and Angst is at the British Museum from 11 April-21 July 2019",

The Royal Horticultural Society is reporting that sales of vegetable seeds are outstripping those of flowers. Houseplants sales, too, are on the up: sales of Monstera \u2013 the cheese plant \u2013 shot up by 150% last year. But what if you simply don\u2019t have a garden to grow them in \u2013 or even a balcony?\nThankfully, growing indoors with limited space is entirely practical as long as you stick to a fast turn-around. Microgreens are ideal \u2013 these are the first flush of a seedling\u2019s leaves and are harvested at about 5-10cm tall.\nWindowsills are often narrow and traditional seed trays are too big, so raid your recycling bin for something to grow your microgreens in. Plastic takeaway trays are ideal. Poke holes in the bottom of the tray for drainage and use the lid as a saucer. Then, fill the tray with peat-free compost, until just below the rim, and sow your seeds fairly thickly, leaving about 1cm between each seed, then water them in. The seeds will germinate quickly indoors \u2013 within a week \u2013 and you can usually start harvesting a week or two later. Use scissors to harvest the leaves.\nLettuce, herbs such as basil, mint, coriander and parsley, peas, celery, chard, any cabbage, watercress, mustards, rocket, chives, radishes and spinach are all ideal. Don\u2019t buy F1 hybrids (selectively bred plants) or expensive seeds: you will be eating this lot before they have started to get going so you want the most seed for your money. If light is limited, invest in an LED grow light. They cost about \u00a320 and allow you to grow anywhere.\nRemember that when you harvest seedlings at such a young stage, they will not keep growing; once cut, you will need to resow. To get a plant to reflush with new leaves, you need a deep root run, 30cm or more, and that is hard to do on a windowsill. Instead, embrace fast-and-furious growing; baby leaves are highly nutritious and pack a mighty punch full of flavour.",

Yet Tuesday\u2019s overwhelming decision by the Confederation of African Football\u2019s executive committee has conferred on them that responsibility and it marks the end of a chaotic process that, quite aside from the logistical blundering that has brought about this situation, leaves the continent once again asking itself broader questions.\nEgypt\u2019s candidacy was approved by a vote of 16 to one, with one abstention, a rival South African bid having failed to get off the ground because of inadequate financial commitments. The process was hurried through after Cameroon were stripped of hosting rights on 30 November; an initial reaction is that Caf has stumbled upon the best possible sticking plaster for a bad job but there is little merit in its flair for sailing close to the wind.\nCameroon was already lagging behind in its preparations when, in July 2017, Caf announced the tournament would be enlarged to 24 teams from its standard 16. At that point the alarm bells should have rung loudly but instead a pretence, regularly undermined by those close to the organising committee and by the delegations that returned from half-constructed venues, was maintained that the west African country could see it through. In September it was granted a last chance to put things right but, with two of the host cities located close to its violence-stricken anglophone regions, the reasons to pull the plug had stacked up insurmountably.\nAs recently as October, the Caf president, Ahmad Ahmad, said his organisation had \u201cnever thought about withdrawing the Cup of Nations from Cameroon\u201d. Ahmad, who made little secret of his wish for a country of such vibrant football heritage to hold the tournament after three of the previous four had been staged in the petrostates of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, was desperate for it to work. He succeeded Issa Hayatou in March 2017, coming through on an appealing ticket of modernisation and transparency, but opted too soon for an expansionist European-style template and was left scrambling, just as his predecessor was in finding replacement hosts for the 2013, 2015 and 2017 iterations.\nThe reasons for those switches differed and it is not the fault of anybody at Caf that political instability and \u2013 in the case of Morocco\u2019s last-minute withdrawal from hosting in 2015 \u2013 disease have forced them to think on their feet on previous occasions. But it makes Ahmad\u2019s insistence on imitating the European Championship\u2019s new format seem reckless when so much of the continent lacks the resources or need for a jamboree of this size. The Chinese-built stadium used in Oyem, in northern Gabon, two years ago already risks being reclaimed by the jungle; it is not a huge stretch, either, to imagine similar problems occurring after Cameroon (who will now host in 2021), Ivory Coast and Guinea have hosted the next three editions.\nYet passing judgment from this distance on questions of progress, and what that ought to entail, is inherently problematic. One certainty is that Caf needs to revive this event\u2019s flagging global profile and Egypt is capable of hosting a full-fat, authentic-looking tournament for the first time since Ghana in 2008. The rise of Mohamed Salah has already piqued interest in a country whose love of international football is visceral. The crowds should be large and boisterous, just as they were when Egypt last hosted, 13 years ago; the infrastructure will pose few problems; and fans from Africa and beyond will have to face none of the visa-related brick walls \u2013 or unfriendly flight times \u2013 that made Gabon and Equatorial Guinea almost inaccessible.\nAhmad\u2019s decision to hold the tournament in the summer should maximise its appeal, too. Yet Egypt\u2019s searing heat \u2013 temperatures could reach up to 40C (104F) \u2013 will spook the medics and may well have a knock-on effect on the football, which reached an agreeably high tempo in 2017 but will find that difficult to match on a baking afternoon in Cairo.\nThe terrorist attack that killed three tourists and their guide in Giza, just outside the capital, last month is another reminder that this tournament will not take place without significant risk; the stadiums themselves will be under scrutiny too given the ban on spectators at domestic games that ran for six years after the Port Said riot in 2012, although the Egyptian FA has pointed out that continental and international fixtures have been hosted to full attendances.\nHow Egypt reacts will be noteworthy given the turbulence the sport has been caught up in during this decade. Its bid was fully backed by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the country\u2019s president, and his government. For Sisi, a Cup of Nations presents an opportunity to show Egypt is open for business and to use football, a tempestuous site for political contestation during and after the revolution, for narrower ends at a time when the regime is regularly condemned for brutality and authoritarianism.\nIt all goes to emphasise that Caf will once again be muddling through while concerns about African football\u2019s wider development, particularly in the light of such a poor World Cup performance from its representatives, hang in the air. On the pitch, perhaps stories such as the qualification of Mauritania \u2013 a shining, and rare, example of how to sensibly invest Fifa funds \u2013 will justify the expansion, while another feelgood story would be written if Saido Berahino and Burundi can book their place in March. But it is Egypt and, perhaps, the totemic figure of Salah who offer the real rescue act in a situation that should never have come to this.",

        "content": "Well-meaning Britons are saving abused dogs from hellish public pounds and death by cannibalism. So why are they making some experts anxious?\nOn a dank, dreary winter afternoon, I have come to a farmyard in Essex, just outside the M25, to meet \u2013 among others \u2013 Karine, Anna, Tommy Lee and Eskimo Joe. Tommy Lee and Eskimo Joe are from Romania, and are dogs. Rescue animals, hoping (if dogs can hope) to be adopted. Tommy Lee is missing a front leg \u2013 most probably from a traffic accident in Brasov, Transylvania \u2013 but is cheerful, inquisitive and friendly. Eskimo Joe is older, a little overweight, obstinate, camera-shy, resigned. I worry that potential adopters might not fall in love with Eskimo Joe.\nKarine and Anna Hauser are Swiss-Finnish sisters (human) and run the charity Love Underdogs. Animal lovers, they were originally visiting a sanctuary in Romania for abused bears from all over the world. But they couldn\u2019t ignore the dogs, and started to work with a shelter in Brasov, 100 miles north of Bucharest, and to bring to the UK for rehoming some of the most unwanted, abused and neglected ones. Love Underdogs is just one of dozens of charities in Britain importing rescue dogs from abroad \u2013 from Greece, Cyprus, Bosnia, and particularly from Romania, which has one of the biggest street-dog problems in Europe.\nIt\u2019s not possible to be precise about the number of rescue dogs arriving in the UK, from Romania or anywhere else. Government figures on dog imports include commercially bred puppies. But the statistics do tell a story: no dog imports from Romania in 2013, and 3,616 the following year. Last year, the figure was 15,548.\nEveryone I speak to agrees that since 2012 rule changes that harmonised the UK with the rest of the EU, making it easier to bring dogs into the country, the number of rescue dogs in the UK has rocketed. Look at all the charities out there (when Love Underdogs started rehoming pets in 2012, it was one of a handful of charities doing it). Look at their social media presences (it doesn\u2019t take long to find a cute face, with sad, pick-ME eyes). Famous people tweet about their Romanian rescue dogs. Columnists write about theirs. Then there is anecdotal evidence close to home \u2026 well, work. Two adopters sit within five metres of my desk, and everyone else seems to know someone who has such an animal. Adopting Romanian rescue dogs is \u2013 to use the technical term \u2013 definitely \u201ca thing\u201d.\nAs she tries to persuade Tommy Lee and Eskimo Joe to pose for photos, Anna explains that the stray-dog problem in Romania dates from the fall of the communist dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu. \u201cCountries that come out of dictatorships have a kind of shift where some things are important and others aren\u2019t.\u201d Dogs weren\u2019t, so the stray population got out of control. Now it\u2019s a political issue, and a business one \u2013 there is money to be made from keeping dogs off the street, catching them, killing them. \u201cWhen it becomes a business, it becomes about cutting costs,\u201d says Anna.\nThey tell me about the place they found in the mountains where about 200 dogs had been left to kill each other and to starve because that\u2019s the cheapest way to get rid of a load of dogs. And they show me pictures of public pounds where the floor is thick with compacted excrement and hair, and where carcasses are piled up on wheelbarrows.\nBut surely bringing a few out (they import about 80 a year, in a van; some charities bring more, others less) will not solve anything? Not on its own, which is why Karine and Anna are involved in projects in Romania: neutering programmes, education, working with their partner shelter and the authorities to make the country\u2019s public pounds less gruesome. And the few dogs they do take out tend to be the most needy. \u201cWhat I say is, you go to Romania, you look at their little faces, and then you tell me to leave them,\u201d says Karine.\nI can look at around 50 little \u2013 and not so little \u2013 faces here at the kennels near Waltham Abbey, just north of London. I meet Miss Babs, who is little and young; Lyra, who is neither and has just had a lump removed; Moe, with little legs and a big overbite and who might appeal to a Simpsons fan; and Winston, who is barking a lot \u2026 A lot of them are, actually enough to drown out the roar of the M25.\nIt\u2019s more peaceful in this room, with Petra Reiterer, an alternative therapist. Reiterer has a selection of essential oils \u2013 ginger, peppermint, valerian, hops, hemp and so forth. She just puts them out and the dogs come in and choose their own, a practice called zoopharmacognosy. \u201cIt\u2019s self-selection,\u201d Reiterer tells me. \u201cSo they\u2019re healing themselves, and I offer them tools.\u201d\nHmm. Perhaps sensing my scepticism, Karine says they were surprised, too, but that they have had some very positive responses.\nNot everyone approves of bringing Romanian strays to Britain. Paula Boyden, veterinary director of the Dogs Trust, the UK\u2019s largest dog charity, says there are diseases in mainland Europe that we don\u2019t have in the UK. With the pet passport scheme, a dog coming from any EU member state has to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies and tapeworm. That is to protect humans, but there are plenty of doggy diseases that aren\u2019t protected against, and she mentions a few scary-sounding ones: babesiosis, which is tick-borne; ehrlichiosis, which affects platelet cells; a heart worm called Dirofilaria immitis; and leishmaniasis, which is incurable and can potentially affect humans. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge worry because we really don\u2019t want those diseases in the UK.\u201d\nThe Dogs Trust gets 30,000 calls a year from people wanting to relinquish animals. \u201cI would encourage anyone thinking about getting a rescue dog to please consider a UK rescue organisation first,\u201d says Boyden. \u201cIf you have been refused, think carefully about why. Think about the challenges of getting a dog from overseas, particularly if you have never met it, from a behaviour perspective, and the disease side as well.\u201d On the behaviour side, she says that many of the street dogs will have been free-roaming, used to making their own choices, and that taking those choices away by putting them into a British domestic environment can increase their stress levels. She mentions a dog from Romania in the charity\u2019s care that was given up for those reasons. \u201cThat dog has certain challenges; it\u2019s not in a position to be rehomed at the moment.\u201d\nFor humans, it\u2019s not easy getting accepted by the Dogs Trust. Alison Coussins describes it as \u201clike trying to get your child into some expensive private school\u201d, before adding: \u201cNot that I\u2019d ever do that.\u201d When her previous dog died, she knew that \u2013 being in full-time work \u2013 she would have problems obtaining a dog from a UK rescue organisation. So she got one from \u2026 Romania, obviously. Via Croydon.\nSuki, who came from a smaller organisation than Love Underdogs, is mostly collie, \u201clike a black-and-white Basil Brush\u201d says Coussins, who had no problem falling in love. They went for a walk. Suki seemed a little skittish, but Coussins, who had been checked and approved, could see no reason not to adopt her, and so she did, \u201cbased on almost no knowledge, which in hindsight might have been foolhardy\u201d.\nThe problems started when she brought Suki back to her home, which Suki began to defend, ferociously. Anyone who visited was barked at, nipped or bitten \u2013 friends, relatives, the dog walker, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2026 Coussins had to cancel her holiday to the Caribbean. As well as working for the housing ombudsman, she is also a magistrate. \u201cSo I\u2019m keenly aware of things like dangerous dogs. I didn\u2019t want to be up before myself,\u201d she jokes.\nSuki, and her owner, needed help. The vet put Suki on fluoxetine (AKA Prozac). Coussins called in pet behaviour counsellor Ingrid Haskal, who came, assessed, reinforced the good behaviour, ignored the bad stuff. And then billed (it hasn\u2019t been cheap, sorting Suki).\nHaskal agrees that adopting rescue dogs from Romania has its risks. You know nothing of their backgrounds. They have probably been wandering the streets, abandoned. They may be aggressive towards other people, other dogs, terrified of going outside, or scared of the world in general. \u201cAlso, you have to consider the fact that every dog is an individual: some may be able to cope with change better than other dogs, in exactly the same way as people.\u201d\nPeople often get Romanian rescue dogs because they have had their heartstrings pulled, says she adds. \u201cYou go on the internet, you go, \u2018Ooh, look at the poor dog in a kennel in Romania or whatever \u2013 we\u2019ll rescue it.\u2019\u201d And this could be their first dog. \u201cSo you get first-time dog owners with a dog that has got a lot of behavioural issues, and they can\u2019t cope. A lot of people who have had dogs for years will get a dog they can\u2019t cope with, but if you\u2019re a first-time dog owner, that\u2019s quite scary, particularly if the dog is aggressive.\u201d\nHaskal admits that she sees the difficult cases, and that there are plenty of adorable, happy Romanian rescue dogs, but she would warn against such adoption for first-time owners. \u201cIf you\u2019re an experienced dog owner who knows what you\u2019re letting yourself in for and are prepared to do a lot of behavioural work, with a professional if needs be, then yes, fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a bicycle with a flat tyre we can fix. There are no guarantees with behaviour because you\u2019re working with a living animal.\u201d\nHer grandfather came from Romania, and Haskal says she really upset one person when she said there were enough rescue dogs in the country without bringing any more in. \u201cShe accused me of being one of the same people who are anti-immigration, and I can understand her viewpoint.\u201d\nSuki has responded well to the treatment, and Coussins finds it impossible to regret adopting her. \u201cI used to work with refugees and with homeless people, and it just reflects what I\u2019ve done with humans. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter if you rescue a dog from Romania or Hammersmith.\u201d\nShe does say you should find out as much as you can. \u201cThink of as many questions as possible and be prepared for a very serious commitment.\u201d\nIn Waltham Abbey, the Hauser sisters know it\u2019s a commitment. But one that can be worthwhile. \u201cThese dogs are different,\u201d says Karine. \u201cThey are much more mature and complex than your normal pooch, and you need a different understanding of them. English dogs go as a puppy to a home; they have not had to deal with survival. Our guys are generations of survivors: they\u2019re complex, independent, free spirits. An English dog is more of a pet and a child; a Romanian dog is a companion and a friend.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s good news for one friend. Three-legged Tommy Lee has a home to go to. The family that have adopted him are volunteers at Love Underdogs. They have another rescue dog, and they\u2019ve had Tommy Lee home for weekends: it\u2019s going to work.\nEskimo Joe? Still waiting, I\u2019m afraid. Maybe for you \u2026",

Leetchi said the funds were intended only for legal fees.\nDettinger handed himself in to police after clashing with officers on a bridge in Paris during an anti-government protest on Saturday. The incident was cited by the government as a sign of the violent turn demonstrations against Emmanuel Macron have taken.\nThe 37-year-old, a French light-heavyweight champion in 2007 and 2008 who retired from the sport in 2013, said in a video that he had \u201cboiled over\u201d after being teargassed with his wife on his eighth Saturday protest. \u201cI reacted badly. Yes, I reacted badly,\u201d he said, adding he had seen the \u201crepression\u201d of the police towards protesters.\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m demonstrating for all the pensioners, for the future of my children, for single women, for everything we\u2019re fighting for. I am a gilet jaune. I have the anger of the people in me \u2026 it\u2019s always the little people who pay.\u201d\nBut the funds raised online, seen as a mark of support for Dettinger, infuriated ministers.\nMarl\u00e8ne Schiappa, junior minister for equality, said: \u201cContributing to a fundraising kitty to support someone who attacked an officer is tantamount to being an accomplice to these grave acts of violence.\u201d\nThe labour minister, Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, called the fundraising campaign \u201cincomprehensible\u201d. \u201cHow can these people tell their children, the young, that violence is the answer?\u201d she told CNews television.\nMounir Mahjoubi, minister for the digital economy, tweeted: \u201cApparently hitting a police officer makes money. When the attraction of money adds to hatred and violence, I feel only disgust.\u201d\nPolice unions warned that the fundraising legitimised violence against police.\nS\u00e9bastien Chenu, an MP for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party, said that the donations were \u201ca barometer of the hatred for the government\u201d before adding that he condemned all violence.\nThe gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement \u2013 named after the hi-vis jackets worn by protesters \u2013 began in November as a revolt against the imposition of a fuel tax, but has morphed into a nationwide movement against the government and the pro-business, centrist Macron, who is accused of favouring the rich and maintaining an unfair tax system.",

        "content": "The artist Wendy Ramshaw, who has died aged 79, was best known for the jewellery she designed, and first gained widespread acclaim for in 1970 with a solo exhibition at the Pace Gallery in London. She presented sets of several complementary gold rings, some with semi-precious stones, establishing a signature vocabulary that she continued to develop in different directions for many years.\nWhen the rings were displayed on a support, they constituted a unified sculptural object. When the wearer detached the rings, they could be deployed on the hand in a variety of configurations. As Ramshaw put it: \u201cMost of my jewellery is made in parts or sections, so that the owner can share in the way the piece is worn.\u201d\nShe pushed the boundaries of jewellery, sculpture, installation and design, working in materials that ranged from precious stones and metals to paper, plastic, porcelain and glass. While a critical, deconstructive approach to the making of jewellery and other aesthetic objects became common after the second world war, Ramshaw was a particular pioneer in this field. In 1972 she was given a Design Council award, and the Electrum Gallery, London, mounted a further solo exhibition.\nAt various points in her career she collaborated with her husband, David Watkins, an artist as well as a musician, whom she had married in 1962. They were invited to show their jewellery in Philadelphia in 1973, under the auspices of the Philadelphia Council of Professional Craftsmen, directed by my mother, Helen Drutt, and that was when I first met them. Along with her work as a curator, Drutt became a gallerist, and a close working relationship and friendship with both artists ensued.\nThe impetus for the exhibition had come from Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall, London, where it was shown after returning from the US. It gave Ramshaw and Watkins much greater access to the world of institutions and collectors.\nRamshaw had more than 30 solo exhibitions around the globe from 1977, including three more major joint exhibitions with Watkins. A retrospective organised by Roy Strong at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 1982 celebrated Ramshaw\u2019s collaboration with Wedgwood, facilitated by the museum, and featured ceramics produced according to Ramshaw\u2019s designs.\nIt subsequently travelled to other venues in the UK and the Netherlands. While every detail of her work was carefully planned and scrutinised, in the catalogue for the show Ramshaw again emphasised the freedom that users of her work should have: \u201cHow or when my work is worn is not particularly important to me. The way in which others may organise it is an open-ended extension of its use. Such a possibility for varying personal choice is interesting precisely because it is out of my control.\u201d\nIn the mid-1980s, she embarked on Picasso\u2019s Ladies, a series of earrings, necklaces, rings and headpieces juxtaposed with images of 66 portraits of the artist\u2019s wives, lovers and female friends that he painted between 1904 and 1962. This bold venture was first displayed complete at the V&A in 1998, followed by the American Craft Museum, New York, in 1999, and demonstrated Ramshaw\u2019s agility in maintaining her own voice, while refraining from copying or illustrating Picasso\u2019s formal evolution. It was also shown in a stunning installation at the Museum K\u00fcnstlerkolonie in Darmstadt, Germany, (2001).\nBorn in Sunderland, now in Tyne and Wear, Wendy was the daughter of Angus Ramshaw and his wife, Flora (nee Hollingshead). A grandfather had been the master of a ship under sail, her father had been a ship\u2019s navigator in his younger years, and as a child Wendy was inspired by \u201cthe beauty of ships, the sea and the sky above\u201d.\nFrom Sunderland girls\u2019 high school and St Mary\u2019s Convent, Berwick-upon-Tweed, she went to the College of Art and Industrial Design, Newcastle upon Tyne, to study illustration and fabric design (1956-60). While at Reading University for a teaching diploma (1960-61), she met David.\nThey discussed design ideas, and in the 60s her brightly coloured paper jewellery proved popular after the model Twiggy was photographed wearing Ramshaw earrings. Then she undertook postgraduate studies in jewellery at the Central School of Art and Design (1969-70).\nLater in her career she accepted notable architectural commissions. The New Edinburgh Gate provides a very public and substantial example of her geometric style in central London, at the Knightsbridge entrance to Hyde Park. Other examples include her gate for the fellows\u2019 garden at St John\u2019s College, Oxford (1993); a double screen for the entrance to the staff restaurant at the V&A (1996); a screen for Columbus Garden at Canary Wharf, London (2000), and again at St John\u2019s College, Oxford, with her gates for the Kendrew Quadrangle.\nShe also ventured into the realm of installation work, notably with her Room of Dreams project, originally conceived for presentation at the Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh, in 2002. A space containing many objects, from small jewels in frames to pieces of freestanding furniture, it was later shown in part at Somerset House, London, and in 2015-16 exhibited at the Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery.

        "content": "Local authorities overspent on children\u2019s services by an estimated \u00a3807m in 2017-18\nAlmost nine out of 10 local authorities in England overspent on children\u2019s social care in the last financial year, as the rising number of children taken into care put extra pressure on budgets.\nAnalysis by the Guardian and the Local Government Association (LGA) found that 133 out of 152 councils (88%) responsible for children\u2019s services overspent in 2017-18. Local authorities went over budget on children\u2019s social care by an estimated \u00a3807m, by far the highest area of overspending in council budgets.\nThe number of children being taken into care stands at a 10-year high. Government data published in November found that there were 75,420 looked-after children in England at the end of March, up 4% on the previous year. The number has increased every year since 2008, when the total was about 60,000.\nThe LGA said the support necessary to keep children safe from immediate risk of harm could be extremely expensive, forcing councils to cut or end vital early intervention services which helped to prevent children from entering care in the first place.\nThe organisation calculated that local authorities faced a \u00a33bn funding gap by 2025 just to maintain the current levels of service in children\u2019s social care. It costs around \u00a356k a year to look after a child in care.\nStuart Gallimore, the president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services, told the Guardian that councils had entered a \u201cvicious spiral\u201d as they struggled to fund the increase in children entering the care system amid budget cuts.\n\u201cLocal authorities didn\u2019t have that [\u00a3807m] just kicking around at the bottom of the money pot, so they\u2019ve either had to go into their reserves to pay for that or they\u2019ve had to take it from other local government services,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOver the course of the past ten years, while local government funding has fallen by almost a half, there has been a small rise in funding for children\u2019s services and that is because people prioritise it \u2013 because that\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\u201cBut that comes at the cost of other council services and at the cost of the reserves that are dwindling in all councils. There is a vicious spiral in terms of being able to pay the costs of those children coming into the care system.\u201d\nWhile education saw the largest decrease in local authority expenditure in the 2017-18 financial year (\u00a31.1bn, 3.3% lower than in 2016-17), children\u2019s social care saw the highest proportional increase, up by 4.2% from 2016-17 to \u00a38.8bn.\nAccording to the Office for Budget Responsibility children\u2019s social care was the single highest area of overspending by local authorities, rising from a total of \u00a3100m in 2011-12 to around \u00a3800m in 2017-18. Other than children\u2019s services, only the categories of \u201ccentral and cultural & related services\u201d and \u201chousing and planning & development\u201d saw overspending in 2017-18, at around \u00a3100m each.\nCouncillor Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the LGA\u2019s Children and Young People Board, said the figures should act as a wake-up call to \u201cthe country-wide crisis we are facing in funding services to protect vulnerable children and young people\u201d.\n\u201cThe fact that the overwhelming majority of councils are now being forced to spend more than they had planned to on children\u2019s social care highlights the urgent need for the government to provide new and long-term significant funding for children\u2019s services.\u201d\nAngela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cLocal government budgets have been cut in half, meaning vital early intervention services are lost and support is often only available when a child reaches a point of crisis. The sheer scale of overspending on these statutory services should make it clear to ministers in Whitehall that their funding cuts are simply unsustainable.\u201d\nIn May, tory-run Somerset county council warned it was at risk of following Northamptonshire county council into bankruptcy after large overspends on children\u2019s services. A report found the council overspent by around \u00a322m on child protection in the previous two years and was not meeting agreed savings targets.\nAnother of the many local authorities to have overspent on children\u2019s social care in the last financial year was Rotherham borough council. The authority overspent on children\u2019s services by \u00a38.3m in 2017-18 and is projected to do so by \u00a317m in 2018-19. The number of children in care in Rotherham has increased from 407 in March 2015 to 662 in November 2018.\nIn January this year, Ofsted said the authority\u2019s children\u2019s services had transformed since Rotherham was hit by a child sexual exploitation scandal. A report in 2014 by Prof Alexis Jay had concluded that 1,400 children had been exploited by grooming gangs over a 16-year period.\nThe deputy leader of Rotherham council, Gordon Watson, said the authority was starting to see the number of children in need coming down, but that the legacy of previous failings was still being felt on budgets.\n\u201cIf you look at a typical council now, two thirds of the spending is in adults and children\u2019s social care,\u201d said Watson. He described children\u2019s social care as a \u201cdemand-led service\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s no good for me as a cabinet member to say \u2018don\u2019t spend any more money\u2019 because if a social worker goes out this afternoon and finds four kids who it isn\u2019t safe to leave at their home, they have to be taken into our care,\u201d he said.\nEarlier this year it was reported that Newcastle city council went over its 2017-18 childcare budget by \u00a35.66m and was predicted to do the same by \u00a36.5m this financial year. The council plans to cut \u00a313.3m from its 2018-19 budget, and by 2020 it will have lost \u00a3283m from its budget in 10 years.\nCouncillor Nora Casey, cabinet member for education and skills, said the children\u2019s social care budget would continue to be under pressure for years unless the government made good on its promise to end austerity, put more money into the system and \u201crestore a social safety net to families up and down the country\u201d.\nSwindon borough council is projected to fall \u00a37.5m into the red on children\u2019s services this financial year. Councillor Mary Martin, the cabinet member for children and school attainment, said this was due to a rise in looked-after children, more expensive independent fostering placements, an increase in children being placed in high cost residential placements and the increasingly complex needs of children coming into care.\n\u201cAs a council, caring for the most vulnerable people in society is one of our main priorities and I make no apologies for doing just that,\u201d she said.\nThe children and families minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: \u201cWe want every child to have the best start in life, with the opportunities and the stability to fulfil their potential, which is why we have made \u00a3200bn available to councils up to 2020 for local services including those for children and young people.\n\u201cWe recently announced an additional \u00a3410m for local authorities to invest in adult and children\u2019s social care in 2019-20. This is in additional to \u00a384m of extra funding over the next five years to support LAs to invest in initiatives that improve social work practice and decision-making to help children stay at home safely with their families, where it is in their best interests.\u201d\nTo calculate overspend, the Guardian and Local Government Association compared initial council children\u2019s social care budgets for the 2017-2018 financial year with the final revenue outturn. Councils may have made in-year adjustments to their initial budgets and the final overspend may differ from figures reported to the Ministry of Communities, Housing and Local Government.",

        "content": "Ex-Labour leader launches campaign to build 3.1m social homes in next 20 years\nThe former Labour leader Ed Miliband has called on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a more radical plan to solve the housing crisis, as he launched a national campaign to win backing for the biggest programme of council and social housing in English history.\nMiliband is calling on the public and party leaders to rally behind a vision of building 3.1m new social homes in the next 20 years, while conceding that it could push down house prices\nThe target is contained in a report by an independent social housing commission, convened by the housing charity Shelter, and is higher than the Labour leadership\u2019s vision of a million in the next decade.\nMiliband said of Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell: \u201cThey need to do more. We want these proposals to be adopted.\u201d Labour responded that its plans were just as ambitious, at least over the next decade.\nThe campaign, launched on Tuesday in central London, is also being backed by the former Conservative party chair Lady Warsi who called on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to consider their argument that the negative impact on people\u2019s lives of the housing crisis warrants spending an estimated \u00a3225bn on social housing, which they estimate would pay for itself in reduced housing benefit payments and other economic benefits within 40 years.\nSo far, the government has responded that it is spending \u00a311bn over the next decade on affordable homes, although this includes more expensive homes than social housing.\nJohn Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: \u201cThis welcome report \u2026 shows just how far the Conservatives are falling short. It\u2019s now time for Conservative ministers to back our plans if they\u2019re serious about fixing the housing crisis.\u201d\nWarsi revealed that when she started working with Miliband as part of the social housing commission established by the housing charity Shelter in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster, she believed the market would provide the solution to the housing crisis.\nShe is convinced of the need for a massive public spending programme, saying that \u201cthe figures stack up\u201d in favour of a massive housebuilding programme that could save billions in housing benefit.\nLord O\u2019Neill, the former economic secretary to the Treasury, who was part of the commission, said tackling the housing problem was also at the centre of improving the productivity of the UK economy, which he described as a greater threat to the country than a hard Brexit.\nMiliband was a minister in the Labour government at a time when social housebuilding was as low as it had been under the previous Tory administration.\n\u201cWe were too late to the emerging housing crisis that was happening and there was a bit of an ideological inheritance that councils shouldn\u2019t really be in the business of building homes any more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do enough to challenge that whole assumption. We should have done more.\u201d\nThe campaign will be supported by Shelter, which is focusing this year on the need for more and better managed social housing. To succeed at government level it will first have to find space in a Brexit-dominated agenda and then overcome entrenched political ideology about the role of social housing as little more than a safety net. Politicians are also likely to be concerned at any proposal that would cause house prices to fall.\n\u201cIf we are to avoid runaway prices of eight times multiple earnings then this needs to be done,\u201d said Miliband, adding: \u201cYes, it might well lead to a slowing of house prices.\u201d\nHe said there could be a fall in some areas and that would be a \u201cgood thing\u201d.",

The failure to strike a deal to stave off collapse will make it the most high-profile victim in the apocalyptic wave of bankruptcies sweeping over the US bricks-and-mortar retail sector.\nRobert Drain, the US bankruptcy judge presiding over the case, gave Lampert until 4pm Wednesday to pay a $120m deposit to keep his bid alive. Lampert believes he can save 55,000 jobs and keep 425 of its close to 700 stores open if Sears approves the deal.\nThe company argued the offer did not cover its bankruptcy expenses. Sears assets will go up for auction on 14 January when Lampert\u2019s offer will be compared with that of the liquidators. Liquidation would lead to the closure of hundreds of stores and the potential loss of 68,000 jobs. Many former workers have had their severance packages stopped even as Sears executives have petitioned to receive up to $25m in bonuses.\nAt a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday in New York, lawyers for Lampert and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, made their case that, as Sears\u2019 biggest creditor and largest shareholder, it should be forgiven $1.3bn of debt in exchange for ownership of the reconstituted company.\nHowever, advisers for the firm claimed the offer was insufficient.\nThe hearing could mark the end of a decade-long adventure for Lampert, considered one of Wall Street\u2019s most aggressive financiers. Once touted as the new Warren Buffet, his background as a hedge funder did not translate to retail. Lampert\u2019s attempt to turn around the company, which included merging Sears with the discount chain Kmart, resulted in further revenue declines, hundreds of store closures and claims of poor management.\nLampert bet that a strong loyalty programme would help Sears prevail against competition from retail giants like Walmart and Amazon. But unlike Walmart, which has invested heavily in retail technology, Sears and Kmart could not compete with Amazon online or with the discounting that Walmart\u2019s scale allowed.\nSears\u2019 last profitable year was in 2010 and sales have dropped by half over the same time period.\nThe loss of Sears will be a symbolic blow to the US retail landscape. Founded in 1893, it was once the nation\u2019s largest retailer. It was known as the \u201cfirst everything store\u201d, selling everything from toys to medicine, gramophones, automobiles, kit houses and headstones.\nBut with about 425 remaining Sears and Kmart stores, Lampert\u2019s plan to restore Sears to the era when it owned the tallest building in the world, in Chicago, as well as a radio station and the Allstate insurance group, never came close to being realized.\nLampert initially won the confidence of investors after he turned around the car parts store Autozone. But as US consumers\u2019 shopping habits changed, and America\u2019s shopping malls lost their appeal, department stores suffered heavy losses.\nIn 1985, chains like Sears, Macy\u2019s and Lord & Taylor accounted for 14.5% of all North American retail purchases. By last year, that had dropped to 4.3%.\nCritics of Lampert\u2019s management said he had let the stores deteriorate, with outdated fixtures, dark lighting and piles of unwanted clothes, even as he bought the company\u2019s stock and lent it money.\nMall owners, too, fell out of love with Lampert\u2019s vision and complained that the poor selection of goods and store layout harmed the overall appeal of the mall itself.\nIn court papers, mall owners Simon Property Group and Brixmor Property Group said Sears\u2019 plan to keep stores open rather than pursue going-out-of-business sales was \u201can unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people\u2019s money\u201d.\nIn court filings, ESL Investments rebutted that charge by saying Simon and Brixmor \u201chave a vested interest in seeing Sears liquidate without regard to the interests of Sears\u2019 other stakeholders\u201d.",

The figures were slightly behind some City economists\u2019 expectations and its shares closed down just over 3% at 213p.\nDavid Potts, the Morrisons chief executive, said: \u201cGoing into November there was a sense that customers were a bit more cautious, a bit more careful with their spending, and there was a feeling of uncertainty in the country that may have led to that [cautiousness].\u201d\nHowever, industry data highlighted the growing success of Aldi and Lidl, with two-thirds of UK households having shopped with one of them over Christmas, handing the discounters their biggest share of grocery spending.\nAgainst this shift in shoppers\u2019 behaviour, all major supermarket chains lost market share in the 12 weeks to 30 December, according to the grocery market analyst Kantar Worldpanel.\nIn its latest update, John Lewis said sales were up 11.2% last week as shoppers hunted for bargains in the final days of its end-of-season sale.\nThe employee-owned retailer experienced big swings in trade during November and December, but finished the year strongly with four weeks of sales that were ahead of Christmas 2017 levels.\nJon Williams, John Lewis\u2019s director of merchandising operations, said fashion sales rose 20% last week. Within that, menswear sales were up 34.3% on last year as Britons snapped up cut-price coats and knitwear. Womenswear and accessories were also up nearly 20% and 25% respectively.\nIt was a different story at Footasylum, which blamed discounting by rivals for needing to run promotions that pulled in shoppers but ate into profit margins.\nThe footwear retailer listed on the junior London Aim market in 2017, but its share price has collapsed due to a deteriorating financial position.\nFootasylum\u2019s executive chairman, Barry Bown, said it did not expect to breach the terms of bank loans, but investors jumped ship, with shares closing down more than 12% at 28.5p.",

In 2016, after a burst pipe wiped out a third of the shop\u2019s stock, Miranda appealed to his fans to help with the Twitter hashtag #BuyABook, writing at length about his memories of the shop. Subsequently, the shop reported a dramatic increase in sales; manager Shawn Verrier told PIX11 that customers were ringing to place large orders without specifying any titles: \u201cPeople are calling in, saying can I buy $200 worth of books, you guys pick them out and just send them to me.\u201d\nHowever, in October 2018, the shop\u2019s vice-president Allen Hubby announced that it would be closing its shop in midtown \u2013 the home of the shop for two decades \u2013 due to rising rents, with the current lease set to end on 31 January.\nThe three new owners \u2013 Miranda, Hamilton director Thomas Kail and James L Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organisation, which owns the Broadway theatre where the hit play is currently running \u2013 purchased the store from Rozanne Seelen, whose husband bought the shop in 1958. She told the New York Times that she had sold it for the cost of her remaining stock, rent support for the next few weeks and the promise that she would stay on as a consultant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chronic problem \u2013 the rents were just too high, and I\u2019m 84 years old \u2013 I just didn\u2019t have the drive to find a new space and make another move,\u201d she said. \u201cLin-Manuel and Tommy are my white knights.\u201d\nAfter the purchase was announced, Miranda wrote on Twitter: \u201cIn 2002, I met with Tommy Kail in the Drama Book Shop. It gave us a place to go. Proud to be part of this next chapter. A place for you to go.\u201d\nThe bookshop will temporarily close on 20 January, before reopening in its new home.",

He also described the devastating impact his suspension and the way it was conducted had on his mental health and wellbeing, and that of his family.\nDavies led the university for 15 years during a time of huge expansion, when student numbers doubled and the institution moved up the league tables. He was one of four members of staff to be suspended, including the dean of the school of management, Prof Marc Clement, who has also denied any wrongdoing and lodged a formal grievance.\nIn his letter, the vice-chancellor called for his suspension to be withdrawn and the disciplinary process to be postponed pending the outcome of his grievance. He said he had been \u201ctreated appallingly\u201d, and claimed he was facing \u201cunfounded and disingenuous allegations\u201d and had been suspended \u201cillegitimately and dishonestly\u201d, causing irreversible damage to his reputation and health.\nA spokesperson for the university, responding to Davies\u2019s allegations, insisted the correct procedures had been followed throughout the investigation and said appropriate support had been offered to him.\nAccording to the letter, Davies said he was given no warning he was to be suspended. He claimed he was escorted off the university campus by the head of security and left \u201centirely socially isolated\u201d after being banned from contacting colleagues.\nDavies said the conditions of his suspension meant he was also banned from unaccompanied access to the university-owned house that had been his family home for the past 15 years, a move he described as \u201cpunitive\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d.\n\u201cBeyond the massive inconvenience of not having access to my clothes, personal items and mail, being excluded from my own home at the incredibly difficult time immediately after my suspension had a huge effect on my mental health and wellbeing,\u201d the letter said.\nThe personal consequences were however \u201cdwarfed\u201d by the potential damage to the institution, he said. \u201cI am being mentally tormented by the almost daily news in the media evidencing the damage this is all doing to the reputation of the university I love, with serious implications for its future financial health,\u201d the letter said.\nThe university has not confirmed the reasons for the suspensions, but Davies\u2019 letter detailed an allegation of gross misconduct and an accusation of \u201chaving failed to assure appropriate due diligence, governance and systems of control around major projects and the commercial activities of the university\u201d.\nIt is virtually unprecedented for a vice-chancellor to be suspended in the UK higher education sector, where senior management figures usually quietly retire.\nThe allegations at Swansea were understood to focus on the university\u2019s involvement in the development of a \u201cwellness and life science village\u201d in the Delta Lakes area of Llanelli. The project, which has been led by Carmarthenshire county council, was put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry at Swansea University.\nA university spokesperson said: \u201cThe suspensions were made following a thorough and wide-reaching internal investigation.\n\u201cThis is still ongoing, so it would not be appropriate to comment in detail at this time, but the university has at all times acted fully in accordance with its own ordinances, and offered appropriate support to Prof Davies.\u201d\nAsked about the vice-chancellor\u2019s claims of being banned from his family home, the university said Davies had indicated that he and his family had moved out of the property in the summer of 2018.",

        "content": "For four years from 1967 the economist Robert Neild, who has died aged 94, served as founding director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\nThere he established a number of programmes that have had a long-lasting impact: the Yearbook on Armaments, Disarmament and International Security (as it is now called), still an essential reference for anyone working in the field of arms regulation; research on the arms trade, including the construction of statistics on the trade in major weapons that continue to be widely used today; and research on chemical and biological warfare, which led directly to the conventions banning these types of weapons.\nHe was also one of the pioneers of the concept of defensive defence \u2013 the idea that it was not necessary to engage in an arms race in order to protect the west effectively against the Soviet threat.\nThis concept was taken up by Mikhail Gorbachev, who adopted a parallel concept of \u201creasonable sufficiency\u201d that allowed him to reduce military spending and to sign in 1987 the INF (intermediate-range nuclear forces) treaty, and engage in negotiations for the START (Strategic Arms Reduction) treaty \u2013 a process that marked the beginning of the end of the cold war.\nNeild\u2019s approach to peace research involved painstaking empirical observation of the real world. \u201cFacts talk,\u201d said the eminent Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal, SIPRI\u2019s first chairman.\nNeild had established this for himself during the second world war when he was invalided out of the RAF in 1944 and sent to work for operational research. \u201cThe beauty of operational research,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cwas that there was no established discipline; there were just problems to which anyone might contribute. Physicists, biologists and scientists from other disciplines were applying their minds to the problems of war.\u201d\nHe was set to work collecting information on the sightings of U-boat snorkels with the aim of identifying a pattern of behaviour. He used the knitting needle system, the same system I used in constructing arms trade statistics when I worked for him at SIPRI.\nEach piece of information was put on an index card with a row of perforated holes at the top. You punched the top of a specific hole to demarcate a particular characteristic \u2013 say, a specific recipient or supplier of type of weapon. Then if you wanted to sort the data according to that characteristic you put a knitting needle through the relevant hole, and the cards you needed fell out. It is the same principle that underlies the digital databases we use today.\nAfter the war Neild was to apply this approach to real-world problem solving, initially in Geneva at the UN Economic Commission for Europe (1947-51), headed by Myrdal, where my father, Nicholas Kaldor, was research director. Neild edited the Economic Survey of Europe, compiling information on industrial production, trade and inflation at a time when there were very few statistics, and on the same principle of setting aside preconceptions as much as possible.\nIn a similar vein, he edited the Quarterly Economic Review at the start of his time with the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (1958-64), and while economic adviser to the Treasury (1964-67) he initiated a survey of social trends, discontinued by the Conservative government in 2010.\nIn later years he continued to apply his mind to practical problems. He loved oysters and puzzled over why oysters are so scarce in Britain and so abundant in France. With The English, the French and the Oyster (1995), he won the Andr\u00e9 Simon prize for food writing. In it, he argued that Britain applied laissez-faire strategies and allowed oysters to be fished to extinction, while France applied planning methods and protected the oyster beds.\nHe also studied the problems of public corruption, starting from the premise that corruption is the norm and the puzzle is how to explain those places where corruption has been largely eliminated. And, as steward of Trinity College, Cambridge, he pored over bursary files in order to discover how the building of Trinity was financed and how it determined the type of stone used or the shape and scale of different buildings and quads.\nBorn in Peterborough and brought up in Letchmore Heath, Hertfordshire, Robert was a twin, and one of three children of Quaker parents, Ralph Neild, an Indian civil servant turned lawyer, and his wife, Josephine, the daughter of J Allen Baker, a Quaker industrialist and MP. Robert was much influenced by his uncle Philip Noel-Baker, a passionate peace activist who won the Nobel peace prize.\nFrom Charterhouse school in Godalming, Surrey, he went to Trinity to study on a short course, joining the RAF in 1943. He returned in 1945 to complete his economics degree in two years, and was taught by the brilliant Marxist economist Piero Sraffa. He witnessed at first hand the devastation of war both as a consequence of his time in Germany working for operational research and a journey across Europe by car through Yugoslavia to Greece, which he made with his cousin Francis Noel-Baker, as an undergraduate.\nIn the 1950s and 60s he gave policy advice to the Labour party and even attempted to become a parliamentary candidate. His first stint at the Treasury (1951-56) was followed by his first as a fellow of Trinity and a lecturer (1956-58); when he returned to the college, it was as professor of economics at the university (1971-84). But he much preferred research to teaching and he found his last years as professor deeply disappointing, as abstract mathematical modelling took over the discipline. \u201cMy earth-bound approach,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas out of fashion.\u201d But it is much needed now.\nHis marriage to Nora Sayre in 1957 ended in divorce four years later. In 1962 he married Elizabeth Griffiths, and they had a son and four daughters. They divorced in 1986, and in 2004 he married Virginia Matheson. She, his children and his twin sister, Barbara, survive him.\n Robert Ralph Neild, economist, born 10 September 1924; died 18 December 2018",

But it was clear Morales had grown uneasy that his political party, family members and he himself were now in the group\u2019s crosshairs, Allison added.\nThere was criticism too from Democratic party politicians in the United States, which helped create the commission just over a decade ago and had, until recently, been a crucial supporter of its work against organized crime and corruption.\nSenator Patrick Leahy accused Morales of seeking to \u201ccripple\u201d the group\u2019s work with what he called a \u201cflagrant abuse of power\u201d. \u201cIt is a choice of self-interest over the public interest. Of impunity over justice. Of lies over truth. And it squarely contradicts the will of the Guatemalan people,\u201d Leahy said in a statement.\nCongresswoman Norma Torres said Morales had spurned a historic opportunity to promote clean governance choosing instead \u201cto destroy the rule of law in order to save himself\u201d.\nTorres called the decision a victory for powerful criminals and corrupt politicians and attacked the Trump administration for failing to challenge Morales\u2019s attack on the anti-corruption body. \u201c[The US] has abandoned the Guatemalan people at the moment when they needed us most.\u201d\nMorales rode to power just over three years ago promising to battle corruption after a multimillion-dollar corruption scandal that the UN-backed panel had itself helped uncover.\nThat scandal toppled former president General Otto P\u00e9rez Molina and paved the way for Morales\u2019 landslide victory in October 2015. His campaign slogan was \u201cni corrupto ni ladr\u00f3n\u201d \u2013 neither corrupt, nor a crook.\nAllison said that during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Cicig \u2013 founded in 2006 to root out shadowy organized crime groups embedded within the Guatemalan state \u2013 had flourished.\n\u201cCicig grew into one of the most effective arsenals in the fight against corruption and impunity in the region \u2026 It was often talked about as a model that could perhaps be exported to Honduras or El Salvador.\u201d\nBut under Donald Trump its work had been allowed to wither. \u201cThe Trump administration I don\u2019t think had any interest in the effort that it needed to defend Cicig \u2026 and at the same time are taking their signals from important Republicans\u201d who saw the group as part of a \u201ctool of the left\u201d.\nBurt said she was shocked at the White House\u2019s failure to challenge Morales over this week\u2019s move which she feared pushed the Central American country one step closer to becoming \u201ca full-on autocracy\u201d.\n\u201cThe reaction of the White House has been abysmal \u2026 for the US to go from being a major support of Cicig to having no opinion about this latest arbitrary move by the state of Guatemala is astonishing \u2026 Ideology is trumping pragmatic politics.\u201d",

        "content": "If Europe\u2019s biggest economy bumps into a slump then UK bargaining power may change\nTake Europe\u2019s three biggest economies and list them in order of the likelihood of being in recession in the second half of 2018. Chances are Brexit-bound Britain would come first followed by France after its gilets jaunes protests. Germany would come last.\nIn fact, it is the eurozone\u2019s locomotive economy that is at biggest risk of fulfilling the technical definition of recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of falling output. After contracting by 0.2% in the third quarter, the latest news from Germany suggests it may have struggled to grow in the fourth quarter as well.\nNews that German industrial production fell by 1.9% in November came as a nasty shock. The stock response to the contraction in the third quarter was that it was due to the tightening up of European vehicle emission standards which led to one-off problems for its carmakers that would quickly be overcome.\nWhile the bounce-back has been delayed rather than cancelled, Europe\u2019s biggest economy faces significant headwinds. The growth spurt generated by monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank has run its course.\nThe European commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator fell in every single month of 2018 and in December declines in all four of the eurozone\u2019s big four economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain. As Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics noted, the weakness cannot be put down to country-specific issues such as the gilets jaunes in France or sector-specific issues such as the disruption of the automotive sector.\nTo make matters worse for Germany, the global economy is also slowing, making it harder for companies to pick up new export orders. Protectionism is not helping either. Donald Trump sees China as his No1 trade target, but Germany \u2013 with its colossal current account surplus \u2013 comes a close second.\nAll of which brings a slightly different perspective to Britain\u2019s debate about Brexit, which currently seems to be based on three key propositions: that continental Europe is thriving; that Europe\u2019s politicians will come under no pressure to cut a deal from their big companies; and that Britain is well adrift at the bottom of Europe\u2019s economic league table. All three are false.\nIt\u2019s a familiar story. Price-conscious consumers sit at home and do their shopping remotely, making life increasingly tough for traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions meant that in November online retail sales accounted for more than 20% of the market for the first time.\nBut while consumers are increasingly likely to buy a shirt or the latest Booker prizewinner online, they are less likely to have their groceries delivered. While it may seem that the roads are choked with supermarket delivery vans, only 6% of food sales are made online and market penetration has stalled. Online spending in late 2018 was up by almost 4% on the previous year but was entirely accounted for by existing rather than new customers.\nThere are some obvious explanations for this. People can have a book left behind the recycling bin but have to be there in person for their food shop. Many of us like to size up the fruit and veg in person for fear we will be palmed off with bruised apples or over-ripe bananas. Not everybody is willing to pay to have their groceries delivered.\nBut eventually, delivery slots will become shorter, policies for returned carrots will become as slick as they are for chinos, and consumers will realise that paying a fiver to avoid a schlep to the supermarkets is actually a good deal. Supermarkets are not immune from the online retail revolution. It will just take longer for food, that\u2019s all.",

        "content": "Martyn Day suggests charges against armed forces instead of individuals after abuse claims in Iraq and Afghanistan\nA statute of limitations could be used to prevent prosecution of military veterans for less serious historical offences, a leading human rights lawyer has suggested.\nAppearing before the Commons defence select committee, Martyn Day called for independent investigators \u2013 rather than the Royal Military Police (RMP) \u2013 to look into serious allegations of abuse.\nCorporate manslaughter charges against the army might also be more appropriate, rather prosecuting individual soldiers, in the aftermath of military campaigns such as in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, he also proposed.\nDay, a prominent London solicitor, and his firm, Leigh Day, have twice been cleared of allegations of professional misconduct over the way they handled compensation claims against the Ministry of Defence over incidents in Iraq.\nThe defence select committee is taking evidence on whether there should be a time limit to investigations into allegations of abuse or murder in the distant past. The MoD is also reviewing whether it can protect veterans from such claims.\nDay told the committee: \u201cI totally am of the view that, true in Iraq, true with Afghanistan, true with Northern Ireland, that there has to be a proper investigation to get to the bottom of what has happened for us as a society to learn the lessons from that and to move on.\u201d\nThe most important issue, he said, was the quality of the initial investigations, which have been carried out in the past by the RMP. \u201cThey have to be seen to be independent and detailed,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the greatest failures in Iraq has been a failure of the RMP to obtain that,\u201d Day added, arguing that effective initial inquiries would prevent former soldiers from being subjected to lengthy and repeated re-investigations.\nDay told MPs that Germany has a statute of limitations system covering lower-grade injuries and assaults. \u201cThere is a massive difference between very severe torture and abuse as against lower-grade things,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cWhen it comes to murder, when it comes to alleged murder, when it comes to the most serious of damage, then I think it is very difficult to say that soldiers should be treated any differently to any other people within society.\u201d\nThe precedent set by the Iraq Fatality Investigations, an inquiry chaired by Sir George Newman, is a useful model for the future, Day said. It has the power to reassure witnesses they will not be prosecuted for any evidence they give \u2013 encouraging them to be more open.\nSuch a system could be used in historic Northern Ireland cases, he suggested, but only if the family of any victim agreed that truth recovery was more important than prosecution. Anyone convicted of Troubles-related offences is already only liable to a maximum two-year prison sentence.\nMuch of the hearing was taken up with aggressive attempts by Conservative MPs to rerun the failed prosecution of Leigh Day by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.\nThe Tory MP Johnny Mercer, a former army officer, accused Day of being \u201cdishonest throughout this process\u201d and \u201cdeluded\u201d in his \u201cingrained hostility\u201d to the army. Dishonesty was not one of the charges brought by the SRA.\nAsked if he would repeat the accusation of dishonesty outside parliament, Mercer told Day: \u201cNo problem whatsoever. You have known for a long time that the individuals in the al-Sweady case were part of the Mahdi Army, that documentation [proving it] was found in your possession.\u201d\nThe al-Sweady case involved allegations about the way in which legal claims \u2013 that British soldiers tortured and murdered Iraqi detainees after the so-called battle of Danny Boy near Basra, Iraq, in 2004 \u2013 were pursued.\nFighting had broken out after members of the Mahdi Army Shia militia ambushed a UK military patrol. It was alleged that some Iraqis were captured and taken back to a British base where they were tortured and murdered.\nThe \u00a331m al-Sweady inquiry found in 2014 that the claims were fictitious. It was also revealed that the Iraqi claimants were not innocent civilians but members of the Mahdi Army.\nDay, who denied dishonesty, pointed out that British courts had decided the Iraqis\u2019 claims needed to be investigated. Inquiries into allegations of army abuse in Iraq had only started, he added, because British troops had used the \u201cfive techniques\u201d of interrogating suspects that had been banned in Northern Ireland in the 1970s. They included sleep deprivation, hooding suspects and putting detainees into stress positions.\nEmma Norton, the head of legal casework at the human rights organisation Liberty, attended the hearing. She said afterwards: \u201cInstead of genuinely exploring the challenge of dealing with serious historical abuse allegations involving the armed forces, key members of the committee simply played to the gallery with poorly evidenced, lazy attacks on lawyers.\n\u201cIf the committee is serious about wanting to protect British soldiers, it will recommend that in future conflicts the most serious allegations must be properly investigated at the outset by a police force wholly independent of the forces.\u201d",

Neither is it inconceivable that L\u00f6\u00f6f, Sweden\u2019s most trusted politician in a host of polls in 2017 and 2018, could also find herself rectifying the former problem \u2013 although most analysts think it unlikely and she herself has said the top job is not her focus.\nThe election left the two dominant centre-right and centre-left blocs separated by a single seat, deadlocked \u2013 and facing a major problem in the form of the far-right, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, the country\u2019s third biggest party. L\u00f6\u00f6f\u2019s Centre, the fourth largest party with 31 seats, a sharp increase on its tally in the previous parliament, is part of the four-member centre-right Alliance, and has sworn never to be a part of, or support, a government backed by the Sweden Democrats.\nCentre\u2019s votes could give a majority to Stefan L\u00f6fven, the outgoing Social Democrat prime minister and leader of the three-party centre-left bloc \u2013 except that L\u00f6\u00f6f campaigned on a promise not to govern with the Social Democrats either.\nBoth L\u00f6fven and the Alliance leader, Ulf Kristersson, have tried and failed to form a new government. L\u00f6\u00f6f was also asked to explore coalition options, but soon gave up, blaming the Social Democrats\u2019 reluctance to accept liberal reforms.\nOnly two more formal attempts to form a coalition are allowed before fresh elections must be called on 23 January. If L\u00f6fven tacks right and wins L\u00f6\u00f6f\u2019s support, she could demand high office as a reward, perhaps even very high office.\nWhether she would get it, of course, is another matter.\n* This article was amended on 14 January 2019. An earlier version referred to L\u00f6\u00f6f as \u201cSweden\u2019s most trusted politician in a host of polls since 2017\u201d. That should have referred to polls in 2017 and 2018. This has been corrected.",

It didn\u2019t resurface properly until the 18th century\u201d (The long read, 3 January). In fact, an awareness of the importance of exercise to health remained a mainstay of the health advice literature circulating in Europe from the 12th century. A genre known as the regimen contained advice on how to conserve health and prolong life by managing one\u2019s diet, sleep, bodily hygiene, the passions, by seeking out good air and taking regular exercise. With the advent of print these books became bestsellers. A typical regimen in 1600 would advise on the kinds of pleasurable daily exercise that people should take according to their age, constitution, sex and class. These included the precursors of tennis, football and golf, as well as fencing, dancing, walking and hunting. The extent to which individuals then, as now, adhered to this advice is quite another matter! Dr Tessa StoreyCo-author (with Prof Sandra Cavallo) of Healthy Living in Late Renaissance Italy\n Vybarr Cregan-Reid\u2019s article took me back to my 17-year-old self in the early 1960s when I noticed that the pavements were mainly occupied by women on foot, often carrying heavy shopping bags, while the road was filled with cars driven by men. This initiated me into feminism and I would bang on about why women, in those days, lived so much longer than men; they were fitter and widowers were a relative rarity.\nOne thing that Mr Cregan-Reid failed to note when he listed the kinds of daily chores that used to keep us active is that they were overwhelmingly undertaken by women \u2013 the longer-lived. As an early feminist I used to bang on about the lack of domestic work undertaken by men as they enjoyed just about all their leisure time while women worked morning, noon and night. Now that women are out at work and using the mod cons he mentioned (and a good thing too), I understand that the gap between the longevity of men and women is narrowing \u2013 but not so much because men are partaking significantly in the domestic work.Margaret DavisLoanhead, Midlothian \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "White House counsel is reviewing whether president has ability to declare a national emergency in this situation, says Pence\nDonald Trump is to make his first Oval Office address to the nation as president to argue that an immigration crisis at the US-Mexico border requires funding for his border wall pet project \u2013 before the federal government partial shutdown can be ended.\nDemocratic party leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi called for Democrats to be given equal airtime. The networks subsequently agreed and they will broadcast a rebuttal.\nTrump is expected to talk for about seven minutes at 9pm east coast time. Democrats are furious at what they see as an Oval Office address, which is usually used to to announce matters of urgent national importance in a non-partisan manner, being subverted for what they see as political argument.\nNegotiations between the White House and Democrats in Congress over reopening the government remained at a standstill as the partial shutdown enters its third week.\nDemocrats have maintained they will not support any legislation that allocates funding toward Trump\u2019s border wall. The president has meanwhile refused to budge from his demand that the wall be built.\nThe president will visit the border on Thursday.\nThe White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, tweeted that Trump will use the trip to \u201cmeet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis\u201d.\nThe Oval Office address will be carried by the main broadcast networks and cable news channels.\nPreviewing Trump\u2019s comments, the vice-president, Mike Pence, told reporters: \u201cThere is a humanitarian and national security crisis\u201d at the border.\n\u201cThe passion you hear from President Trump, his determination to take this case to the American people, as he will tonight in his national broadcast from the Oval Office, comes from this president\u2019s deep desire to do his job to protect the American people,\u201d Pence said during an appearance on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Tuesday.\nImmigration experts argue otherwise, pointing out that the rate of illegal border crossings has been in decline over the past decade. Last year, the population of undocumented immigrants in the US reached a 12-year low.\nPence on Monday said Trump has yet to decide whether he will officially declare a national emergency over his demand for a wall along the south-west border \u2013 the key sticking point in negotiations over the partial government shutdown that is  affecting more than 800,000 federal employees.\nWhite House counsel is reviewing whether the president has the ability to declare a national emergency in the current situation, Pence told reporters at a media briefing on Monday. He added that the administration would prefer to secure the funding for border security from an agreement with Congress.\nDeclaring a national state of emergency would all but certainly invite legal challenges. Trump said there is \u201cno doubt\u201d he has the legal authority to declare a national emergency but said \u201clet\u2019s get our deal done in Congress\u201d.\nThe shutdown, which has lasted 17 days, is already the second-longest in US history and would become the longest if it stretches into this weekend.\nNegotiations between Democratic congressional leaders and the White House are at a stalemate. Both sides have dug in over the wall after fraught meetings last week. Nancy Pelosi has called the wall \u201cimmoral\u201d and refuses to budge on providing taxpayers\u2019 funding for it.\nAs a first act, the newly empowered House Democrats passed legislation last week to reopen the government while congressional leaders and the administration continued to debate border security. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said he would not take up legislation the president did not support.\nIn 2010, Barack Obama used his first Oval Office address as president to lay out his response to the catastrophic BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He returned to the format that same year to announce the end of US combat operations in Iraq and only once more, in 2015, to discuss terrorism.\nThe Oval Office has been used for such historic moments as John F Kennedy discussing the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and Lyndon B Johnson declaring in 1968 that he would not seek re-election. Richard Nixon memorably announced his resignation as president from the Oval Office following the Watergate scandal in 1974.",

        "content": "MPs back amendment to finance bill to curb government powers in event of no deal\nTheresa May was handed a humiliating defeat in parliament by Labour and Conservative MPs who organised to demonstrate the strength of parliamentary opposition to leaving the EU with no deal.\nMPs voted by 303 to 296 in favour of an amendment to the finance bill tabled by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper to curb some of the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of no deal without explicit authorisation for parliament.\nThe coalition of high-profile MPs behind the amendment are expected to use the victory as a springboard for further parliamentary action to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU.\nSir Oliver Letwin, the former Tory minister who rebelled to back Cooper\u2019s amendment, said: \u201cThe majority tonight that is expressed in this house will sustain itself. We will not allow a no-deal exit to occur at the end of March.\u201d\nTwenty Conservatives rebelled against the government, including the former defence secretary Michael Fallon and former education secretary Justine Greening.\nTory MPs were whipped to vote against the amendment, despite rumours that the government would concede. Eleven Tories had signed the amendment, including former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, select committee chair Sarah Wollaston, former minister Nick Boles and Sir Nicholas Soames.\nDuring his speech in the Commons, Letwin sounded almost tearful as he said he would rebel against the Tory whip. \u201cI will be voting with [Cooper] against my own government, very much against my own will, and I will continue to do so right up until the end of March in the hope we can put paid to this disastrous proposal.\u201d\nPrivately those behind the amendment\u2019s success concede it may have little material effect on no-deal preparations. Instead, its purpose has been to galvanise MPs across the house and prove there is a parliamentary majority to oppose no deal, which they expect could grow when subsequent amendments are tabled to other bills, which could have wider-reaching consequences.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Cooper said MPs across the house agreed on the dangers of no deal. \u201cI\u2019m worried we could come to the crunch and parliament will not have the powers to stop [no deal] happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have a responsibility not to just stand by.\u201d\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who turned round and applauded Cooper in the chamber as the defeat was announced, said: \u201cThis vote is an important step to prevent a no-deal Brexit. It shows that there is no majority in parliament, the cabinet or the country for crashing out of the EU without an agreement. That is why we are taking every opportunity possible in parliament to prevent no deal.\u201d\nLabour threw its weight behind the amendment on Monday afternoon, as Treasury officials and Tory whips scrambled to assess the impact it could have on Treasury operations.\nOpening the debate, the shadow Treasury minister Jonathan Reynolds said it had the support of the opposition because it was \u201ca chance for parliament to make a clear statement rejecting a no-deal outcome and that is a statement that cannot come soon enough\u201d.\nHe said that the government had \u201crun down the clock\u201d towards the 29 March exit date. \u201cNobody should be underestimating at this stage how likely a no deal exit could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has got us to the point of ruin.\u201d\nMorgan said those who had signed the amendment had different views both on Brexit itself and on the way forward. \u201cIt is right that parliamentarians on both sides of the house should rule out the most damaging thing that could happen on 29 March,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt would be a gross dereliction of responsibility of members of this house to inflict a no-deal situation on our constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time for members on all sides to make it clear to the government that a no-deal outcome for Brexit is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d\nThe veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke, a prominent Europhile, said crashing out with no deal would leave the UK \u201cas the only developed country in the world that has no trade agreements at all with anyone and made to fall back on WTO rules, made to sound marvellous by Brexiteers but do not amount to very much.\u201d\nOpposition to the rebels\u2019 amendment came from pro-Brexit Labour MP Kate Hoey, who said it would be \u201cirresponsible for the government not to be making contingency plans for a WTO situation\u2026\u201d\nBackers of the amendment concede that it cannot, in and of itself, stop a no-deal Brexit from occurring. It is attached to a clause designed to give the government the power to keep some areas of tax administration working in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nCooper\u2019s amendment meant that new power would only be allowed to come into force if there were either a Brexit deal, a decision to extend article 50, or a vote in the Commons specifically approving a no-deal Brexit.\nIt is this format of three options that MPs may later decide to attempt to apply to other bills going through the Commons.\nA number of bills could be amended, which might have more significant impact on day-to-day government operations. Seven bills must be implemented in order to provide a smooth exit by March, including trade, agriculture, healthcare, financial services, fisheries and immigration, as well as legislation for the withdrawal agreement.\nGovernment sources had briefed that the material effect of the finance bill amendment would be \u201clow down the list\u201d of difficulties if the UK was heading towards a no-deal Brexit and officials suggested that more emergency legislation would probably be needed, where the government could attempt to restore these powers without caveat.\nEarlier, May\u2019s spokesman said the amendment was \u201cnot desirable but the effect of the amendment on no-deal preparations would be inconvenience rather than anything more significant\u201d.\nHe said it would not prevent the government from collecting tax. \u201cWhat clause 89 does is allow the government to make minor amendments to tax law, in consequence of EU exit, in order to keep the tax code working as it currently does,\u201d the spokesman said.",

        "content": "The IOC\u2019s decision to keep 2012 Olympics samples for 10 years has led to a steady drip of retrospective failed tests that have given the London Games an unwanted record\nTen or so years ago the Evening Standard ran the billboard headline \u201cLondon Fashion Week Cocaine Shock\u201d. Presumably the twist was that there was someone alive surprised to find it was going on, since the revelation seemed just about as startling as the fact they were playing baccarat in Rick\u2019s place. Over Christmas, the International Weightlifting Federation dropped another bombshell when it announced that five Olympics weightlifters have just been provisionally suspended because some \u201cadverse analytical findings\u201d were discovered when the International Olympic Committee recently retested samples provided in 2012.\nThere were 260 weightlifters at London 2012. So far, 24 have failed tests.\nThe IOC is keeping the London 2012 samples for 10 years, so it can take advantage of the new testing technology developed since. The retest results have been coming in an insistent drip, drip, drip, like a leaking tap no one has bothered to fix. It\u2019s left quite a puddle of mess. A Kazakh hurdler, Natalia Ivoninskaya, failed a test in October, the Latvian long jumper Ineta Radevica failed a test in November, now these five weightlifters \u2013 Oleksiy Torokhtiy, from Ukraine, Ruslan Nurudinov, from Uzbekistan, Melanie Daluzyan, from Armenia, Mikalai Novikau, from Belarus, and Valentin Hristov, from Azerbaijan \u2013 failed tests last month.\nTorokhtiy and Nurudinov are Olympic champions. Torokhtiy, who won the men\u2019s 105kg title in 2012, is an interesting case. His win was such an upset even he seemed surprised (\u201cIn sport you can never be sure in anything,\u201d he wrote, \u201cexcept drug tests.\u201d). He parlayed his success into a second career as a strength and fitness coach. He has a YouTube channel with 83,000 subscribers, an Instagram account that is three times as popular, and his own clothing line, Warm Blood, Cold Mind. He comes across as a likable guy, who has done a lot for the sport. On 23 December he addressed the failed test in an Instagram post.\n\u201cA few days ago I received an official letter from the International Testing Agency which notified me that after the retesting of my six and a half year old samples for the 2012 Olympic Games they found a banned substance. At this time I have more questions than answers. All test, before, during and after the Olympic Games didn\u2019t show anything! More than that, I literally trained for almost a year with a torn meniscus and didn\u2019t allow myself to take painkillers. I urge all athletes of all ranks, from beginner to professional to personally check the antidoping rules of IWF, the Wada list of banned substances, and EVERYTHING that is ingested by you, especially your supplements, the ingredients of which are the only factor which you can\u2019t truly control.\u201d\nPresumably that includes the supplements he is flogging on his website, too. But anyway, another week, another failed test. The record books are rewritten, asterisks added, results struck through, runners-up bumped up, and everyone who cares grows a little less certain about what they can really believe. Life goes on. A couple of days later, Torokhtiy was posting happy snaps of his family wishing his followers a merry Christmas, and pitching them a new idea for a weightlifting camp \u2013 \u201c10 days together, first part of the day we\u2019ll be training and then volleyball, swimming pool, BBQ and a lot of socialising! What do you think?\u201d\nRadevica says she is not sure how she failed her test either. She was the European champion in 2010 and won silver at the world championships in Daegu in 2011 after the Russian athlete who finished ahead of her, Olga Kucherenko, was disqualified because she tested positive. Radevica received that silver only last year. Now she has lost it again. \u201cThroughout my career, I have always been against the use of unauthorised substances and I am firmly opposed to illegal substances in sport at the moment,\u201d Radevica said, \u201cwhich is why I have been particularly unlucky.\u201d She has just stepped down from her job as the head of the Latvian athletics federation.\nAltogether, then, the London 2012 list of failed tests runs 116 long, which is an Olympic record, beating the mark of 86 set at Beijing. There are three years of testing left, so the final figure will be higher. London, which was supposed to be the cleanest Games in history, turned into the dirtiest. Of course, those are two different sides of the same coin. The IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, argues that the reason so many dopers have been exposed is because the authorities were so determined to catch them. If they had been so willing, and the technology so able, in the 1970s, 80s or 90s, the mark might be as far out of reach as one of those fossilised athletics records such as Flo Jo\u2019s 10.49sec 100m.\nPerhaps. Though anyone who is paying attention must suspect Lord Coe is underestimating the size of the problem. One piece of research into the prevalence of doping in athletics, an academic paper called Doping in Two Elite Athletics Competitions Assessed by Randomised Response Surveys, which was conducted in 2011 and published in 2018, suggests the problem was likely a lot more widespread than that tally of failed tests suggests. In an anonymous survey of athletes at that Daegu world championships in 2011, a year out from London, 43.6% of the respondents admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs in the previous year.",

On Tuesday evening, the department of home affairs confirmed it has made representations to the Thai government and the Bangkok office of the UNHCR about \u201cits serious concerns on this matter and the need for Ms Al-Qunun\u2019s claim to be assessed expeditiously.\u201d The 18-year-old Saudi woman, who barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room to prevent her forcible return to a family she claims will kill her, has been taken under the protection of the UN high commissioner for refugees in Thailand. Human Rights Watch Australian director Elaine Pearson said Australia has a moral obligation to help Qunun: \u201cThe government has said that promoting women\u2019s rights is a priority as part of its foreign policy; well here\u2019s a concrete case where they can protect a young woman\u2019s life.\u201d\nTheresa May was handed a humiliating defeat in parliament by Labour and Conservative MPs who organised to demonstrate the strength of parliamentary opposition to leaving the EU with no deal. MPs voted for an amendment to a finance bill to curb some of the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of no deal without explicit authorisation for parliament. The coalition of high-profile MPs, including 20 Conservatives, are expected to use the victory as a springboard for further parliamentary action to prevent the UK crashing out.\nTwenty-two people, more than twice the usual number, have been hospitalised this summer with Irukandji stings.

This week, Rooney, 27, became the youngest novelist ever to land the Costa awards\u2019 best novel category. Normal People is now favourite to win the prize for overall book of the year at the end of the month. Her second novel has been a surprise \u2013 not for its quality, which was assured after her confident debut Conversations with Friends \u2013 but for the response to it. There hasn\u2019t been a literary novel that has had such an impact on conversation since perhaps Jonathan Franzen\u2019s Freedom, or, before that, Monica Ali\u2019s Brick Lane, or even before that, Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth.\nUncle Wes Marne, 96, has been telling stories \u201csince Moses played fullback for Jerusalem\u201d.

Then it flies non-stop to Siberia.\n\u201cFor a creature with such endurance, the eastern curlew is in perilous danger of losing vital habitat \u2013 and its battle for survival. Although we love the coast, we love only a very specific kind of coast: golden sandy beaches and deep blue bays. Shallow seas over vast mudflats don\u2019t catch our imagination, or our hearts, regardless of how rich the ecosystem of invertebrates and birds they sustain is. But the threats that eastern curlews are facing right now demand that we re-assess what we value.

He was sentenced to life without parole, avoiding the chance of the death penalty as a result of admitting the crime.\nLast year a serial murderer in California, known as the Golden State Killer, was caught in similar circumstances, via commercial DNA sleuths.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, to the family,\u201d the 50-year-old Rowe said on Tuesday in court as he faced Mirack\u2019s relatives. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through.\u201d\nThe case had stymied investigators until authorities working with DNA from the crime scene used a publicly available genealogical database to identify a half-sister of the then-unknown suspect. This led them to Rowe, who had lived just miles from where the killing occurred.\nUndercover detectives obtained DNA from Rowe by collecting his used water bottle and chewing gum at a school where he was DJing last year. It matched DNA recovered from the carpet in the victim\u2019s home.\n\u201cIf not for the grace of modern technology and divine intervention, you probably would have stayed in Lancaster and basked in your fame,\u201d the teacher\u2019s brother, Vince Mirack, told the defendant during the hearing.\nHe said the killing, which occurred four days before Christmas, destroyed his family\u2019s sense of security and their love of the Christmas holiday. \u201cBut most of all you took our Christy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI can only hope that the remainder of your life is as painful to you as the last 26 years have been to my family,\u201d Vince Mirack said.\nThe teacher\u2019s roommate had left their apartment about 15 minutes before Rowe arrived and forced his way inside, investigators said. She had her coat and gloves on, with plans to give Christmas presents that day to students and co-workers.\n\u201cShe was surprised and actually fought for her life, and unfortunately failed,\u201d district attorney Craig Stedman said.\nMirack was badly beaten and was probably strangled.\nProsecutors said they are not sure whether Rowe and Mirack knew each other or why he targeted her.\nRowe lived about four miles from Mirack in 1992, and the prosecutor said Mirack\u2019s home was on a likely route between Rowe\u2019s home and where he worked at the time.\nHis vehicle back then, a white Toyota, matched one that witnesses had seen at the apartment complex that morning.\nAn online biography for Rowe said he was a breakdancer in the 1980s, won local DJ battles and then hosted dance parties at Lancaster\u2019s Chameleon Club. His site lists events he has worked in New York and regular gigs on local radio stations.",

        "content": "Government suffers defeat during debate on the finance bill in the Commons\nTheresa May faces a concerted campaign of parliamentary warfare from a powerful cross-party alliance of MPs determined to use every lever at their disposal to prevent Britain leaving the EU without a deal in March.\nThe former staunch loyalist Sir Oliver Letwin signalled that he and other senior Conservatives would defy party whips, repeatedly if necessary, to avoid a no-deal Brexit, as the government suffered a humiliating defeat during a debate on the finance bill in the Commons.\nLetwin and 16 other former government ministers were among 20 Conservatives who banded together with the home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, and the Labour leadership to pass an anti no-deal amendment.\nThey defeated the government by 303 votes to 296 \u2013 a majority of seven \u2013 making May the first prime minister in 41 years to lose a vote on a government finance bill.\nThe move came after the PM conceded to senior ministers she was on course to lose next week\u2019s historic Brexit vote, as the first cabinet meeting of the new year exposed deep divisions about the best way out of the deadlock.\nMay told her cabinet she would respond swiftly with a statement to the House of Commons if she failed to win MPs\u2019 backing for her deal next Tuesday. But cabinet sources said it was unclear what course she planned to take \u2013 and the general mood was of how \u201cboxed in\u201d the government was.\nSeveral pro-remain ministers, including David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark, used the meeting to stress the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit, with Rudd saying that would have to mean reaching out across the House of Commons.\nRudd told her colleagues: \u201cMore than ever we need to find the centre, reach across the house and find a majority for what will be agreed. Anything will need legislation.\u201d\nHowever, opponents of a softer Brexit, including the House of Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, played down the risks of no deal and joined May in strongly rejecting the idea that has gained traction in Westminster in recent days of extending article 50.\nLeadsom has told friends she would refuse to table the legislation necessary to extend article 50, so that May would have to sack her if she wished to pursue such a policy.\nBut Tuesday\u2019s rebellion by erstwhile Tory loyalists underlined parliament\u2019s determination to take control of the next steps in the Brexit process.\nLetwin, who gave an emotional speech saying he had almost never rebelled against his party, made clear Tuesday\u2019s vote was the first step in a concerted effort by parliament to bind the government\u2019s hands in the run-up to Brexit day.\n\u201cThe majority tonight that is expressed in this house will sustain itself,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow a no-deal exit to occur at the end of March.\u201d\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the vote was an important step to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt shows that there is no majority in parliament, the cabinet or the country for crashing out of the EU without an agreement\u201d, he said. \u201cThat is why we are taking every opportunity possible in parliament to prevent no deal.\n\u201cTheresa May must now rule out no deal once and for all.\u201d\nAt cabinet earlier on Tuesday, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, had warned that too many MPs were holding out for the ideal Brexit deal, instead of facing the reality that there was no alternative to May\u2019s approach.\nOne source said he had compared MPs hoping for a better deal to \u201cmid-50s swingers,\u201d wishing Scarlett Johansson would turn up to one of their parties. \u201cOr Pierce Brosnan,\u201d said Rudd.\nLater in the discussion Gauke, the justice secretary, compared Labour\u2019s Brexit position to Johansson turning up on a unicorn, the Whitehall source said.\nClark stressed his determined opposition to a no-deal Brexit publicly on Tuesday, telling MPs, \u201cI\u2019ve always been very clear representing the views of small business and large business that no deal should not be contemplated.\u201d\nThe prime minister was expected to announce fresh reassurances on her deal in the coming days, including a beefed-up role for parliament in framing the next stage of negotiations on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\nDowning Street has also been expecting the EU27 to offer further written reassurances about the Irish backstop, which has proved the most controversial aspect of the exit deal among Brexiters.\nHowever, they appeared likely to fall short of the legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement the Democratic Unionist party has demanded.\nFrench EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said on Tuesday, \u201cregarding the Irish backstop no one wants to activate it\u201d, adding, \u201cthese are political assurances but there is nothing more that we can do\u201d.\nLoiseau also stressed that the deal MPs would vote on next week represented \u201cthe best possible agreement\u201d, and \u201cthe only one\u201d.\nTory MPs were whipped to vote against the no-deal amendment on Tuesday evening, despite rumours that the government would concede.\nPrivately, some cabinet Brexiters believe May would rather exit with no deal than tack towards a permanent customs union, or single market membership. But Tuesday\u2019s vote suggested MPs were resolved not to let that happen.\nBefore the vote, the prime minister had addressed a packed room of MPs, mostly from Labour and other opposition parties, who had signed a letter urging her to rule out no deal.\nThose present said that the prime minister tried to sell her Brexit deal, arguing that no Brexit would have \u201cserious consequences for our democracy\u201d and that the best way to avoid no deal \u201cwas to back a deal\u201d.\nOne Labour MP said after the meeting she was \u201ca lot more concerned about no deal\u201d because she had heard several other MPs warning of the risks of it in their constituencies.\nThose behind the amendment\u2019s success conceded it may have little material effect on no-deal preparations. Instead, its purpose had been to galvanise MPs across the house and prove there was a parliamentary majority to oppose no deal. The rebels said they could seek to amend any and every piece of legislation the government brings to parliament between now and March.\nCooper, speaking in the Commons, said MPs across the house agreed on the dangers of no deal. \u201cI\u2019m worried we could come to the crunch and parliament will not have the powers to stop [no deal] happening,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have a responsibility not to just stand by.\u201d\nLetwin, during his speech in the Commons, sounded almost tearful as he said he would rebel against the Tory whip. \u201cI will be voting with [Cooper] against my own government, very much against my own will, and I will continue to do so right up until the end of March in the hope we can put paid to this disastrous proposal.\u201d\nThe government also confirmed on Tuesday that there would be five more days of debate on the Brexit deal, starting on Wednesday, with the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, opening the debate.\nHowever, the business motion tabled by the government suggested it would effectively be a resumption of the debate that was unexpectedly paused on 10 December, when May conceded she was likely to lose \u201cby a significant margin\u201d.",

It means that countries in eastern Europe like Moldova and as far away as Georgia and those in North Africa will be affected.\u201d\nThe warning came as the bank forecast a drop in global economic growth in 2019 and 2020, largely in response to slowing growth across the developed world. It said that global average growth would fall to 2.9% this year and 2.8% in 2020, after slipping to 3% in 2018, down from a forecast of 3.1% made in June last year.\nWhile the slowdown remained relatively mild, the bank warned in its latest health check of the global economy that there were \u201cdarkening prospects\u201d, not just from a no-deal Brexit, but from a more aggressive trade war between the US and China and growing political tensions.\n\u201cAt the beginning of 2018 the global economy was firing on all cylinders, but it lost speed during the year and the ride could get even bumpier in the year ahead,\u201d said world Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva.\n\u201cAs economic and financial headwinds intensify for emerging and developing countries, the world\u2019s progress in reducing extreme poverty could be jeopardised. To keep the momentum, countries need to invest in people, foster inclusive growth, and build resilient societies.\u201d\nIn its last forecast, the bank urged the US president, Donald Trump, and China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to resolve their trade disputes or risk an economic crash equivalent to the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe bank said that due to lingering uncertainties about the trade war and volatile commodity markets, with oil prices plummeting since last summer, this year would be the first since 2008 when large parts of the developing world failed to generate the income needed to reduce poverty rates.\nA hard Brexit would take Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and ends its obligations to respect the four freedoms, make big EU budget payments and accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ: what Brexiters mean by \u201ctaking back control\u201d of Britain\u2019s borders, laws and money. It would mean a return of trade tariffs, depending on what (if any) FTA was agreed.\u00a0See our full Brexit phrasebook.\nIn 2018 large parts of sub-Saharan Africa suffered a rise in poverty, jeopardising the bank\u2019s plan to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.\nThere were hopes at the bank, which was handed a $13bn (\u00a310.2bn) boost to its lending facility last year, that the situation would improve again in 2019. But every developing world region except east and south Asia would see poverty levels stagnate at best this year, the bank said.\nGeorgieva said the fall in global growth could largely be blamed on slowdowns in the US, Europe and Japan. Growth among advanced economies is forecast to drop to 2% this year as higher interest rates and trade worries weigh on business and consumer confidence.\nEmerging market and developing economies, which need to expand at a faster rate just to keep pace with high rates of population growth, would see growth slow to 4.2%.\nBritain, which has been forecast to grow at 1.3% this year and 1.4% in 2020 following a successful Brexit deal, would see its meagre GDP expansion evaporate should it leave the European Union without a transition deal.\nThe World Bank has come into focus this week following the resignation of its president, Jim Yong Kim, who quit to join a private investment firm with more than three years of his second term left to run.\nKim has become increasingly frustrated with traditional forms of aid and the failure of the bank\u2019s efforts to dramatically cut poverty rates, especially in Africa.\nAt the bank\u2019s annual conference in Bali last year he said he wanted to focus on improving the education of young people in the developing world as the most effective way to boost jobs and incomes, moving away from large-scale infrastructure projects and disaster relief efforts.\nGeorgieva, who has become interim president, and Ohnsorge declined to comment on Kim\u2019s departure, which sources inside the bank described as a sudden and \u201cpersonal decision\u201d.\nThe bank\u2019s forecasts show that China\u2019s economy will slow over the next four years, dampening the prospects for a strong recovery from the current global slowdown. From a rate of expansion of 6.9% in 2017, China\u2019s GDP growth would fall to 6.2% this year and next, before dropping to 6% in 2021.\nAccording to its own analysis, a 1 percentage point drop in China\u2019s growth rate would bring down growth in the developed world by 0.3% and trigger a 0.6% drop in emerging market economies.",

In a statement, CTA officials said the product \u201cshould not have been accepted for the Innovation Awards Program\u201d because it \u201cdoes not fit into any of our existing product categories\u201d.\n\u201cCTA has communicated this position to Lora DiCarlo,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe have apologized to the company for our mistake.\u201d\nHaddock called this \u201can even more insulting and frankly ridiculous assertion\u201d. She noted that her team of engineers designed the Os\u00e9 in partnership with Oregon State University, whose robotics lab is ranked as one of the best in the nation.\n\u201cOs\u00e9 is the subject of eight pending patents and counting for robotics, biomimicry, and engineering feats,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOs\u00e9 clearly fits the Robotics and Drone category \u2013 and CTA\u2019s own expert judges agree.\u201d\nCTA\u2019s statement does not explain why Lora DiCarlo can no longer showcase its product at CES, and officials did not immediately respond to follow-up questions. But Techcrunch noted that OhMiBod, a Kegel exerciser, won the digital health and fitness product category in 2016. Meanwhile, Haddock pointed out that \u201ca literal sex doll for men launched on the floor at CES in 2018 and a VR porn company exhibits there every year, allowing men to watch pornography in public as consumers walk by\u201d.\n\u201cMen\u2019s sexuality is allowed to be explicit with a literal sex robot in the shape of an unrealistically proportioned woman and VR porn in point of pride along the aisle,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFemale sexuality, on the other hand, is heavily muted if not outright banned.

        "content": "But critics say there is no evidence such registers increase community safety or reduce re-offending\nThe names, faces and \u201cgeneral\u201d location of child sex offenders could be publicly available online under a proposal from Peter Dutton to establish a national child-sex offender register.\nHowever the nation\u2019s law council has warned any public sex offender register is not \u201ca silver bullet\u201d, while researchers for the Australian criminal intelligence body most likely to administer any register have previously questioned the effectiveness of such a proposal.\nThe states and territories, as well as non-government stakeholders, including the Law Council and advocacy groups such as the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, have been asked their views on the register, which would be the first of its kind in Australia.\nIn a statement released early on Wednesday morning, Dutton said consultation was underway, with the register potentially including identifying details of convicted abusers, including the type of crime, birthdate and postcode. Juvenile offenders would not be included on the register.\n\u201cIt would have a strong deterrent effect on offenders and ensure that parents are not in the dark about whether a registered sex offender has access to their children,\u201d Dutton said.\nSpeaking to Sydney radio 2GB, Dutton said the proposal was a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t identify the individual addresses, so I think we avoid the problem of vigilante groups or people forming outside particular residences that might be occupied by a register sex offender, but we do propose to give the person\u2019s locality by postcode,\u201d he said.\n\u201c\u2026Families would have a better idea of who is living within their postcode, to either have an awareness in discussions with their children, make sure that they knew about somebody who had unsupervised contact of their children in a sporting sense, or in another group activity within the community.\u201d\nWhile the Daniel Morcombe Foundation welcomed the idea, child safety advocate Hetty Johnson slammed the proposed register as \u201ca political ploy\u201d.\n\u201cElections are going to be run on fear or hope,\u201d she said, after listening to a press conference held by Dutton on Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201cThis is going to be run on fear. It is winning votes on the backs of children\u2019s very lives and I get upset about that. That annoys me and I know this is a political thing and they all do it. But I think Mr Dutton is better than that and I am disappointed.\u201d\nDutton was questioned at the press conference on the timing of the announcement, given the Coalition has been in power since 2013.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for some time \u2026 we\u2019ve been looking at ways in which it has been operating overseas and we have been looking at ways in which we can collaborate with the states,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is not an extreme measure, it is not too soft, it is not too hard.\u201d\nThe Law Council of Australia has not objected to the idea, but believes it should only apply to \u201coffenders who pose a demonstrated risk to children\u201d, while stressing inclusion on any public register \u201cshould never be automatic\u201d.\nResponding to Dutton\u2019s proposal, council president Arthur Moses said the register would have to be \u201cstringently monitored to avoid unintentional errors\u201d and only apply to the highest levels of offending, and done through the discretion of the courts.\n\u201cInclusion brings onerous reporting obligations like ongoing police monitoring of and involvement in a person\u2019s activities, the risk of adverse community attention and vigilantism,\u201d Moses said.\n\u201cTherefore only offenders posing a demonstrated risk should be required to register.\n\u201c\u2026Child sex offences are amongst the most abhorrent that come before our courts and, as the recent royal commission illustrated, for too long offenders were placed in a position where they could re-offend,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is why we need to get it right. We must be careful to ensure laws are not enacted that create negative unintended consequences that impact the wider community.\u201d\nThe Northern Territory government announced similar plans in 2014, but was ultimately unable to bring it to fruition. At the time, then-prime minister Tony Abbott said he was \u201cdisinclined\u201d for a national register.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a national murderers register, we don\u2019t have a national thieves register, we don\u2019t have a national white collar criminals register,\u201d Abbott said in October 2014.\n\u201cI think the most important thing is to do what we can to have strong and effective law enforcement agencies, to have strong and effective laws, and I think if we\u2019ve got strong and effective police forces, strong and effective criminal intelligence, if we\u2019ve got judges and prosecuting services that are taking swift action when criminals or potential criminals are arrested, I think that is the best way forward.\u201d\nIn 2015, the NT Law Society concluded a register was \u201cnot right\u201d for the territory, citing a lack of evidence.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that public registers of this nature are successful in increasing community safety or reducing the rates of offending or re-offending,\u201d the organisation said in a statement.\nIt also said \u201cvictims of crime may well feel shamed by the publication, especially if the offender is a family member.\u201d\nLast year the Australian Institute of Criminology, which has since merged with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and would be the government body most likely tasked with administrating any public register, released a report which found no evidence public registers resulted in reduced recidivism.\nIt also raised the issue of teenagers caught \u2018sexting\u2019, which can be prosecuted as a child sex crime, finding their way onto any register, given the broad sweep of Australia\u2019s laws.\n\u201cOne of the key lessons learned from the US experience is that policies introduced rapidly in response to single, widely publicised incidences are generally not successful in achieving their aims,\u201d the AIC report concluded.\n\u201cPolicy responses to sexual offending need to be carefully considered and must be based on strong, theoretical foundations, supported by evidence.\u201d\nA spokesman for opposition leader Bill Shorten said Labor would wait to see what the states and territories had to say, as well as look at the proposal which was being put forward, once it included more detail.\nLegislation passed by each individual state and territory established the Australian Child Protection Offender Reporting scheme in the early 2000s, giving police access to registered sex offenders and their movements, once any jail sentence has been completed.\nLast year, following a campaign by Derryn Hinch, the register\u2019s powers were extended to allow authorities to cancel the passport of registered sex offenders, who were suspected of traveling overseas for child sex.",

        "content": "Mauricio Pochettino wants to scream when he is told that he must win a trophy to validate his work at Tottenham. The manager wants supporters to see the bigger picture; how he has the club punching above their weight when it comes to things like balance sheets.\nPochettino wants to win the Carabao Cup purely for the thrill of winning and his team put their noses in front at the halfway stage of the semi-final before the Stamford Bridge second leg, which has been scheduled for Thursday 24 January.\nIt was far from the most free-flowing performance of a season that promises so much for them and Pochettino was left to enjoy the grit they showed to keep Chelsea out. The visitors were the team that pushed and they created the chances to have taken reward. But Maurizio Sarri \u2013 who is also without a trophy from his managerial career \u2013 could lament Chelsea\u2019s lack of cutting edge.\nSarri gave a start on the right wing to Callum Hudson-Odoi, the 18-year-old who is the subject of a \u00a335m offer from Bayern Munich, and he had some nice moments, including a deflected cross in first-half stoppage time that Paulo Gazzaniga clawed against the post and to safety.\n\u00c1lvaro Morata had been ruled out with a slight hamstring injury and Sarri preferred Eden Hazard to the fit-again Olivier Giroud in the central attacking role. Hazard was dangerous, as always, but he could not find a way to goal. Sarri sent on Pedro for Willian and Giroud for Hudson-Odoi but, whichever way he sliced it, Chelsea were blunt where it mattered the most.\nThere was bad finishing, particularly from the centre-half Andreas Christensen when gloriously placed on a set piece on 58 minutes, but also bad luck. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 was denied in the 40th minute by the same post that would thwart Hudson-Odoi.\nIt was Harry Kane, inevitably, who made the difference and when he banged home from the penalty spot midway through the first half it was his 160th goal in Spurs colours, lifting him above Cliff Jones into fourth place on the all-time list. A reminder: Kane is only 25. The execution was nerveless and clinical.\nKane had won the kick when he fastened on to Toby Alderweireld\u2019s long ball and touched decisively past the outrushing Kepa Arrizabalaga before being clattered by him. It was a clear foul. Yet there was confusion because the assistant referee raised his flag for offside against Kane. It was extremely tight and so we went to VAR.\nIt took an age to clear up but Kane was deemed to have timed his run to perfection. There could surely be no arguing with the technology, or could there? The Chelsea captain, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, led the protests to the referee, Michael Oliver, during the interval while Sarri would later insist that, having seen the replays on Chelsea\u2019s feed, Kane looked offside. It was an argument that ran and ran.\nWembley had been the scene of Chelsea nightmares in late November when they did not turn up for the Premier League fixture against Spurs. The 3-1 scoreline was a mercy. When Sarri reflected recently on his first season in English football, he mentioned the losses to Wolves and Leicester as his regrets. The Spurs mauling? \u201cI don\u2019t talk about that,\u201d he said.\nPochettino employed the same system, with Dele Alli in a roving role behind Son Heung-min and Kane; partly to construct a creative platform for him, partly to have him stifle Jorginho when Chelsea had possession. That had been the basis of the league victory. It did not work here.\nAlli released Son early on with a ball over the top that Christensen just about dealt with, while Kane sent an overhead kick at Arrizabalaga but Chelsea, who flickered at the other end, could feel that they made a solid start. After the goal they were the better team.\nHudson-Odoi had worked Gazzaniga with a low shot on seven minutes and thought he had his moment when he crossed and watched the ball loop up off Danny Rose. Gazzaniga did well to backtrack and push against the post.\nSpurs tried to build from the back and that involved risking the ball as Sarri\u2019s players pressed. There were murmurs of exasperation from the home support. Kane extended Arrizabalaga on 52 minutes but it was Chelsea who showed coherence and came to pen Spurs in. They were the team in control.\nHazard, who turned sharply and probed throughout, worked Gazzaniga on two occasions from distance while Kant\u00e9 also forced him into a save on 55 minutes. The moment when Chelsea\u2019s hearts truly skipped came shortly afterwards. Ross Barkley flicked on a corner and there was Christensen, all alone at the far post. He scuffed his shot horribly.",

        "content": "Jack Ross had said he was unwilling to \u201cdress this game up as something it\u2019s not\u201d but neither set of supporters listened to Sunderland\u2019s manager.\nDeep down, almost everyone accepted it failed to constitute a \u201cproper\u201d north-east derby and compensated by simply pretending it was. Accordingly, within the first 11 minutes there were two earsplitting, giant, bangs made by firecrackers released in the away end and the scent of smoke filled the cool January night air.\nIt all seemed more downtown Beirut circa civil war days than a Checkatrade Trophy last-16 tie pitting Sunderland\u2019s League One first-teamers against Newcastle United\u2019s Under-21s, but by the end the Wearsiders were just two matches from Wembley.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a normal game,\u201d Ross reiterated. \u201cBut the atmosphere gave me a taste of what proper derbies must be like.\u201d\nDespite Newcastle being underdogs, Blaydon Races was sung loudly, and on repeat, from the away end, play proceeded at 100mph and several challenges were full-blooded. At times it felt nearly as exciting as the real thing. The trick to preserving that illusion was to avoid looking down at the away technical area where Ben Dawson, rather than Rafael Ben\u00edtez, shook hands with Ross.\nAdmittedly the crowd was only 16,654 \u2013 2,780 of them having arrived from Tyneside complete with police escort \u2013 which is small for a ground that attracted more than 46,000 for the Boxing Day win against Bradford but it was extremely noisy.\n\u201cThe atmosphere was tremendous,\u201d said Dawson. \u201cIt was a great experience for my lads \u2013 but they\u2019re very disappointed.\u201d\nThe rather flexible Checkatrade rules permit Premier League sides to field five overage players. Two can have made more than 40 first-team appearances, but Ben\u00edtez was unwilling to risk any first-teamers so Dawson made do with an authentically junior side, naming five substitutes.\nWith Sunderland third in the third tier and pursuing automatic promotion, Ross\u2019s priority was Saturday\u2019s home game against second-placed Luton and he made six changes from the side that drew at Charlton last weekend. Nonetheless it was a strong looking XI, captained by former England Under-21 international forward Duncan Watmore and studded with battle-hardened pros.\nNot that Dawson was daunted. A full year since filling a vacancy created by Peter Beardsley\u2019s ongoing suspension while Newcastle investigate complaints of racism and bullying \u2013 allegations Beardsley denies \u2013 the understudy can reflect on 12 successful months. After all, this competition has seen Dawson outwit high-profile league managers in Grant McCann (Doncaster), Harry Kewell (Notts County, since sacked), Michael Jolley (Grimsby) and Sol Campbell (Macclesfield).\nHe has been helped by the prolific form of Elias S\u00f8rensen, Newcastle\u2019s 19-year-old Denmark Under-21 striker, who ran out here fresh from signing a new three-year contract, but the somewhat lightweight 19-goal leading scorer found things tough against Ross\u2019s streetwise defence.\nAlthough S\u00f8rensen was eventually withdrawn after an anonymous display, one spell of visiting pressure \u2013 featuring every pass cheered to the rafters by away fans \u2013 concluded with Robbin Ruiter diverting Callum Roberts\u2019s angled shot.\nGenerally Sunderland\u2019s comparative physical maturity ensured Newcastle largely showcased some impressively composed defending \u2013 with centre-half Owen Bailey and central midfielder Matthew Longstaff both assured. Creditably, they initially made things awkward for Ross\u2019s side, forcing Dylan McGeouch and friends into slapdash concessions of possession and it took their hosts 47 minutes to break the deadlock.\nIndeed, when Jerome Sinclair hit a post Sunderland\u2019s luck seemed out, but from Chris Maguire\u2019s resultant corner Newcastle\u2019s Kelland Watts turned the ball into his own net. Charlie Wyke headed a second from another Maguire corner, then Maguire scored the third himself before Benjamin Kimpioka\u2019s header made it four and the ground reverberated to \u201cWe\u2019re going to Wemberlee\u201d.\nDawn still remained several hours away but, after two successive relegations, Wearside could almost feel the warmth of a restorative sun.",

He is due to have a testimonial in the close season and is keen to sign on again.\n\u201cWe are talking about that \u2013 I would like it,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe\u2019s our captain, 11 years here, we saw in the last two [league] games the huge quality and personality he has to play. The only problem with Vincent is one: his injury problems.\u201d\nThe matches Guardiola was referring to were the wins over Southampton and Liverpool, for which Kompany was recalled. Asked whether his defence is stronger when Kompany plays the manager said: \u201cOne against one absolutely we\u2019re better when Vincent plays. [Aymeric] Laporte has a better left foot \u2013 every central defender has his own quality \u2013 but there\u2019s no doubt Vincent has something special with his charisma, winning the duels. It\u2019s incredible, he\u2019s one of the best central defenders I\u2019ve ever seen. The problem is whether he\u2019s fit.\u201d\nWith Burton at the Etihad for Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, City are guaranteed to play at least five more domestic matches than Liverpool this season, after J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team were knocked out of the FA Cup and Carabao Cup in the third round. Guardiola is unsure whether this could give Liverpool an advantage in the title race. \u201cI don\u2019t have a theory from my experience about that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everyone is fit and not injured we can cope with it. The problem is if you have 10 injured players, it\u2019s almost impossible. When everyone is fit, it\u2019s better.\n\u201cIf we had just one competition to play in, I could play with the same 11 or same 12. Now everyone is involved \u2013 the players don\u2019t know who will play against Burton. Then after four days we have another final at home to Wolves [in the league].\n\u201cI prefer it, definitely \u2013 I like to be in the four competitions as far as possible. When Wigan put us out of the FA Cup last season I was sad. I take the cups seriously. Against Rotherham [Sunday\u2019s 7-0 FA Cup win], for example, we played with nine players who didn\u2019t play against Liverpool and the nine were a good selection.\n\u201cIt was perfect for the rhythm for Kevin [De Bruyne], [Ilkay] G\u00fcndogan, Nico [Otamendi], Kyle [Walker]. It\u2019s better to play Rotherham. Seventy minutes for Kevin at full intensity and tomorrow trying to play a little longer.\u201d\nGuardiola has denied a claim that the grass on the Etihad Stadium pitch was left long to slow down Liverpool during Manchester City\u2019s 2-1 win last Thursday. Guardiola said about the assertion on the Anfield Wrap podcast: \u201cI\u2019m not the greenkeeper. I never did \u2013 if they want to play quick, we want to play quicker; always we try to put water [on] but it\u2019s not necessary here because of the weather.\u201d",

Under the Aviation Security Act it is an offence to endanger the safety of an aircraft. Anyone found guilty of this offence could face a life sentence.\n\u201cWe are deploying significant resources \u2013 both in terms of officers and equipment \u2013 to monitor the airspace around Heathrow and to quickly detect and disrupt any illegal drone activity; some of which are as a result of learning from the incidents at Gatwick.\u201d\nCundy would not elaborate on what forces had been deployed and the Ministry of Defence said only that \u201cspecialist equipment\u201d had been sent to Heathrow, west London, at the request of the police.\nIt is believed that the armed forces used the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can detect and jam communications between a drone and its operator, at Gatwick in December.\nA spokeswoman for Heathrow said the runway had been closed as a precautionary measure shortly after 5pm, as staff worked with the Met to investigate the report. At about 6pm, the runway had reopened. Inbound flights were not affected.\nWhile the disruption at airport on Tuesday evening was less severe than that caused in the run-up to Christmas, when 140,000 people were affected by repeated closures at Gatwick, the latest incident raises further questions about the UK authorities\u2019 preparedness to protect vital infrastructure from the devices.\nBesides the military deployment, the junior transport minister Liz Sugg was due to meet the heads of the UK\u2019s main airports on Thursday to discuss their plans to deal with drones. Preparations for the meeting began last week in the aftermath of the Gatwick disruption.\nOn Monday, the government announced that police were to be handed extra powers to combat drones near airports, giving them power to land, seize and search the devices. The Home Office was due to begin testing and evaluating the use of counter-drone technology at airports and prisons.\nLast week, Heathrow and Gatwick said they had invested significant sums of money in military-grade anti-drone technology. While it would not offer details on exactly what equipment had been installed, Gatwick said it had purchased a system that offered a similar level of protection to that offered by the armed forces during the pre-Christmas disruption, while Heathrow was understood to have invested in similar equipment.\nAlso last week, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, chaired a meeting of defence chiefs, the police and Home Office officials to discuss the issue.",

        "content": "There is, of course, no such thing as a sure thing. No guarantees, no certainties. Except, now and then, when there is.\nAs Harry Kane stepped back from the penalty spot with 26 minutes gone at a chilly, boisterous Wembley Stadium he didn\u2019t bother to frown or compose himself. He didn\u2019t take a deep breath and look troubled, as he might have just for form\u2019s sake.\nInstead he stood for a second, stepped forward and spanked the ball with the top of his boot into the corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga, who made a token flinch with his right arm, reduced to a piece of scenery in another man\u2019s five-second short movie (working title The Centre Forward\u2019s Complete Absence Of Fear Of The Penalty).\nKane wheeled away, remembering to look overjoyed, or at least vaguely surprised at this turn of events, his seventh goal in his last six games for Tottenham.\nKane has been described as a star player without any obviously extreme qualities. Watch him warm up before a game and you realise this overlooks the fact that when it comes to spanking a ball at goal he is prodigious, hypnotic, utterly thrilling in his power and accuracy.\nSome players waft the ball into the crowd during those drills. Kane simply murders it into the corners over and over again. It isn\u2019t luck, or a coincidence or goal-hanging that means this keeps happening. He has just worked away at the margins, made it so the percentages will always favour him; become, in effect, a sure thing.\nThis was the only real lesson to be drawn from what was at times a strange Carabao Cup semi-final. Chelsea had 17 shots to Tottenham\u2019s six. Eden Hazard was mesmerising in the second half, sniping constantly into space, gliding past the white shirts like a ghost in blue. And yet for all their pressure, their 57% possession, the closest Chelsea got to scoring was a deflected first-half cross.\nBut then, they didn\u2019t have Kane. Or, indeed, any kind of centre-forward at all, lining up with a three-man front line of Willian, Eden Hazard and Callum Hudson-Odoi: three fine players full of craft and cleverness who between them have five goals in Chelsea\u2019s last 20 matches.\nFor all its complexities, its deep theory, so much of football\u2019s narrative is reverse-engineered out of the finest details: choosing the right centre-forward, for example, and then playing him the right way.\nBesides scoring the only goal, Kane was quietly brilliant at Wembley, playing in his slightly adjusted role with Son Heung-min so high up the pitch. It is a semi-10 position that brings out his ability to spin and pass in deeper spaces. Kane had spent a part of the autumn looking drained, reduced to walking backwards through the centre circle, hands groping out for a defender to wrestle.\nHe has recovered his mobility, found the freedom to make those veering sprints that drag opponents into horrible places. Midway through the first half he ambled back into his own half, took the ball on his chest with an agreeable thud and volleyed a spectacular crossfield Harry Hollywood pass into the path of Son on the far side.\nThe run for the goal was the best part. When Kane can sprint behind the defence from halfway then he has the whole quiver of arrows at his back, good enough to hold the ball there, but also to hare away from Antonio R\u00fcdiger before being bumped to the ground by Arrizabalaga.\nKane had been flagged offside. VAR suggested he was on, or on enough. The rest was a formality, a tick in the box, and a lesson too in the importance of that simple cutting edge.\nHudson-Odoi played well without ever looking totally settled. It isn\u2019t hard to see what so many have seen in him already. With 20 minutes gone he took the ball by the touchline, rolled his foot over the ball and just glided past Harry Winks with an easy little surge of speed. Hudson-Odoi may yet be off to Bayern Munich in search of game time. At the same age Kane was sharpening his teeth at Millwall, but then not everyone can be quite so fortunate.\nAnd for all their second-half pressure Chelsea\u2019s edge was elsewhere at Wembley: sitting on the bench to the 79th minute in the shape of Olivier Giroud, or absent completely in the form of the injured \u00c1lvaro Morata, a \u00a360m, quadruple league-winner, double Champions League-winning centre-forward who may or may not be any good, nobody really knows for sure.\nFor now they are all some way short of Harry, the greatest hunch any modern-day Spurs manager ever had, the gift that has kept this Poch-era team rolling along through the turbulence of the stadium years \u2013 and the edge that makes all the difference on nights like these.",

Now Mark Zuckerberg plans to host talks about technology\u2019s future in society\nHe built one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, transformed the media and information landscape across the globe, upended elections, fueled ethnic violence, and helped your mom keep in touch with her high school classmates.\nNow Mark Zuckerberg is taking on a new challenge: podcasting (basically).\nThe Facebook chief executive announced on Tuesday that his \u201cpersonal challenge\u201d for 2019 will be to \u201chost a series of public discussions about the future of technology in society \u2013 the opportunities, the challenges, the hopes, and the anxieties\u201d.\n\u201cEvery few weeks I\u2019ll talk with leaders, experts, and people in our community from different fields and I\u2019ll try different formats to keep it interesting,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. The events (and may we suggest the name ZuckTalks?) will be broadcast on Facebook, Instagram or other media, he said, and will challenge him to \u201cengage more in some of these debates about the future, the tradeoffs we face, and where we want to go\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and I used to just build out my ideas and hope they\u2019d mostly speak for themselves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut given the importance of what we do that doesn\u2019t cut it anymore.\u201d\nZuckerberg\u2019s personal challenges have become a key part of his public persona in recent years, and they have evolved from traditional New Year\u2019s resolution fodder (running, reading, eating veggies) into corporate communications bonanzas. In 2017, after the election of Donald Trump Zuckerberg embarked on a series of photo-ops with regular people across the country.\nBut in 2018, as it became increasingly clear how Russian operatives used the platform to interfere in the US presidential election, the CEO pledged to buckle down and \u201cfocus on fixing\u201d his company. Zuckerberg wrote at the end of the 2018 that he was \u201cproud of the progress we\u2019ve made\u201d in addressing those challenges, though most people outside of the company would agree Facebook still has plenty of work ahead.\nZuckerberg\u2019s 2019 challenge is eminently more achievable. (The CEO eschewed the suggestions of a number of tech experts and critics surveyed by the Guardian whose recommendations included resigning, going back to college, and taking up macrame or falconry.) And the 34-year-old billionaire is not the first tech titan to enjoy the sound of his own voice. LinkedIn cofounder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman interviews business leaders, including Zuckerberg, on the podcast Masters of Scale. The VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor Jason Calacanis also host podcasts about startups and the tech industry.\nIn his post, Zuckerberg said his discussions will explore a number of questions to which his answer has traditionally been \u201cmore Facebook\u201d. \u201cDo we want technology to keep giving more people a voice, or will traditional gatekeepers control what ideas can be expressed? \u2026 In a world where many physical communities are weakening, what role can the internet play in strengthening our social fabric?\u201d he asked.\nJust two years ago, Zuckerberg published a lengthy manifesto arguing that the solution to those weakening social ties was Facebook groups, and he has long professed a steadfast belief in the value of social media \u201cgiving more people a voice\u201d.\nWhether the CEO\u2019s decision to \u201cdebate\u201d these questions in public portends him changing his mind in any way remains to be seen. But for a billionaire who has reportedly grown frustrated with the \u201ctraditional gatekeepers\u201d of the independent press, creating his own content is a natural next step.\nZuckerberg built the most powerful megaphone in media history. Now he\u2019s going to use it.",

        "content": "Molluscs not only have tidal and circadian clocks but are attuned to lunar rhythms, experts say\nThe gentle glow of moonlight on water has moved musicians, poets and painters \u2013 and, it turns out, molluscs. Researchers have discovered the opening and shutting of oysters\u2019 shells appears to be tied to the lunar cycle.\nBiological clocks have intrigued scientists for centuries, and researchers in the field won the 2017 Nobel prize for studies into the 24-hour body clock.\nHowever, organisms do not necessarily have biological processes linked only to the rhythm of day and night, the circadian clock. Other patterns that include links to the tides have been found for species including the horseshoe crab, and to the phases of the moon for creatures including the bristle worm. Some have suggested the latter may also affect humans.\nNow experts say they have found evidence that oysters not only have a circadian clock and a tidal clock, but are also attuned to lunar rhythms.\n\u201cIt was a surprise to see that there is a such an effect of the moonlight,\u201d said Laura Payton, co-author of the research from the University of Oldenburg.\nWriting in the Biology Letters journal, Payton and her colleague Damien Tran from the University of Bordeaux describe how they tracked the behaviour of 12 Pacific oysters submerged off the French coast over the course of three and a half lunar cycles from the end of 2014.\nThe team used electrodes to track the molluscs\u2019 degree of opening every 1.6 seconds and looked at astronomical data to assess how much of the moon was illuminated.\nThe results reveal the oysters were most open in the buildup to \u2013 and presence of \u2013 a new moon, and less open as the moon entered first quarter and full phases.\nThe team says that suggests oysters can sense moonlight \u2013 even though it is far less intense than the sun\u2019s rays.\nHowever, Payton said the situation was complex, noting the creatures appeared to be able to tell if the moon was waxing or waning: the oysters were generally more open during the third quarter than the first quarter.\nPayton said one possiblity was that the benthic bivalves may have evolved an internal lunar clock, rather than passively relying on direct cues. In that case, she added, the moonlight sensed by the oyster would help keep this clock in sync with the environment rather than directly triggering the opening and shutting of the shell \u2013 similar to how humans use daylight to keep their internal 24-hour clock on track.\nThe team suggests the increased opening of the oysters when moonlight levels are lower might be linked to the possibility that more food is available at low light levels: previous studies have suggested the movement of plankton also appears to be influenced by light. \u201cWe know that oysters open their valves when there is food,\u201d Payton said.\nHowever, the study did not look at the impact of the moon on oysters\u2019 behaviour in all seasons, or take into account cloud cover \u2013 and hence the actual level of moonlight the molluscs experienced.\nDavid Wilcockson, a senior lecturer in aquatic biology at Aberystwyth University, said there were still many mysteries in the field. \u201cWe know that, for example, tidal, lunar and circadian clocks appear to have separate mechanisms, but they are to some extent linked \u2013 and we don\u2019t know quite how and to what level,\u201d he said.\nWilcockson said human activity could cause unexpected problems in marine environments \u2013 an issue research like the latest study could help examine. \u201cIf you have coastal lighting, for example, or lighting on marine structures, then of course we don\u2019t really know what the impacts of those might be,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Exclusive: The meeting comes more than 40 days after the Australian-based refugee was detained in Thailand\nAustralia\u2019s football federation executives have finally met with the president of the Asian Football Confederation and Bahraini royal, Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa, more than 40 days after Hakeem al-Araibi was detained in Thailand.\nAl-Araibi is a Bahraini dissident who has lived in Australia for four years, and is a permanent resident with refugee status on the basis of his fear of persecution in Bahrain.\nThe meeting is understood to have occurred at the AFC Asian Cup football championships in the United Arab Emirates, with FFA chair Chris Nikou expressing Australia\u2019s desire to have al-Araibi freed and returned.\nIt follows weeks of criticism of the football bodies, as well as the international organisation Fifa, for an apparent lack of advocacy on behalf of the detained 26-year-old footballer.\nAustralia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, announced a visit to Thailand on Wednesday afternoon. She said as part of her trip, she would \u201cadvocate for the safe return to Australia of Mr Hakeem Alaraibi, who is currently detained in Thailand. Mr Alaraibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian government in recognition of his status as a refugee.\u201d\nBoth FFA and the AFC declined to comment on the Asian Cup meeting or the attendance of Sheikh Salman.\nWhen asked for further detail, FFA said it had been in contact with Australian officials since al-Araibi\u2019s detention.\n\u201cFFA confirms it has also held direct dialogue with senior officials from Fifa, AFC and the Football Association of Thailand,\u201d a spokesman said.\nThe AFC said it was \u201cworking with Fifa and other stakeholders\u201d, and FFA said it \u201cremains in contact with the Australian government and continues to advocate for the release\u201d of al-Araibi.\n\u201cFFA requests the governments of Australia, Thailand and Bahrain to continue their efforts to enable the release of Mr Hakeem al-Araibi and to ensure his safe return to Australia in accordance with internationally recognised human rights conventions.\u201d\nAl-Araibi was detained at Bangkok airport in November on an erroneously-issued Interpol red notice which raised questions about the internal processes of Interpol, the Australian Federal Police, and the home affairs department.\nHe is currently in a Bangkok prison while a Thai court assesses Bahrain\u2019s extradition request. He was recently told he could no longer use the phone, meaning his wife and family in Australia are unable to contact him.\nAl-Araibi\u2019s lawyers have lodged a citizenship application with Australia in an attempt to strengthen the country\u2019s ability to demand his return, but have not received a response.\nThe Australian government has reportedly said it will consider offering a humanitarian visa to Saudi woman, Rahaf al-Qunun, who was also arrested in Bangkok this week and was facing deportation.\nThe arrest of al-Araibi has drawn international condemnation and numerous human rights organisations and football groups are campaigning for his release.\nHowever Fifa, the AFC, and FFA have all been criticised for their muted responses or silence.\nThe day after al-Araibi was arrested, senior executives of FFA met with Sheikh Salman, and tweeted a picture from the FFA account. A spokesman told Guardian Australia they were unaware of the situation at the time, but there has not been any apparent contact since, until the Asian Cup meeting.\nYahya al-Hadid, of the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights (GIDHR) said the football community, particularly in Australia, had rallied behind al-Araibi alongside human rights defenders, but there were question marks around the larger bodies like Fifa.\n\u201cIf their relationship to Gulf states is affecting their responses, it raises the question: are they independent?\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe silence of Fifa is concerning \u2026 also the silence of the AFC and its president. Don\u2019t they have ethical rights and responsibilities to protect their members?\u201d\nFormer Socceroos captain and football commentator, Craig Foster, likened the situation to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of football politics, with no one apparently willing to ruffle feathers ahead of two elections in 2019 \u2013 for the AFC and Fifa leaderships.\nThis collaboration between Thailand and Middle East is extremely concerning in a growing number of cases, including Hakeem\u2019s. Most disappointing is that a global football showpiece is underway in the shadow of horrible abuse of human life yet politics and money trump basic rights\nSheikh Salman is seeking reelection to the AFC presidency, and FFA chair Nikou is seeking a place on the AFC executive committee.\nSheikh Salman is a member of the Bahraini royal family and was specifically criticised by al-Araibi in media interviews in 2016 for his lack of assistance when he and other Bahraini athletes were targeted.\nThe athletes were caught up in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests during the Arab Spring. Al-Araibi was tried and convicted in absentia in a trial which was clouded by accusations of coerced confessions and the ignoring of key evidence.\n\u201cHis own government is requesting the extradition of the player, he\u2019s part of the royal family and clearly has great sway there and yet to date \u2026 appears to have done absolutely nothing to advocate for Hakeem\u2019s rights,\u201d Foster said last month.",

        "content": "On his funny and ramshackle speaking tour, the Australian musician becomes an amateur again \u2013 but answers most, if not all, of the audience\u2019s questions\n\u201cYou\u2019re part of an experiment in connection,\u201d Nick Cave says from the stage. His In Conversation show, currently touring Australia, centres on questions and song requests but, like Cave\u2019s new Red Hand Files website, \u201cthere will be no moderator\u201d. So first he must briefly mire himself in rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019s nemesis: a bit of housekeeping. The rules of play.\nWhile Cave is dressed impeccably at the Sydney Opera House, his collaborators tonight are no cool-as-fuck Bad Seeds. They\u2019re in sensible shoes and fluoro vests, and are cheerfully waving those lightsaber batons used to direct planes on to the tarmac. \u201cIf you have a question signal to them,\u201d says Cave. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll \u2026 whatever.\u201d He burns out on explicating the detail. Fair enough. He\u2019s got bigger fish to fry.\nThe first fish is slapped down by a woman who shares his love of Leonard Cohen. \u201cBut can you explain Avalanche?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s always seemed so dark and incomprehensible to me.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI like it because it\u2019s dark and incomprehensible. The big problem with most songs is that the meaning is too clear. I can play it if you like?\u201d\n\u201cWould you?\u201d she says, her voice gone high and swoony.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do a version where I\u2019m singing to you,\u201d he says. Then, at the piano: \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to fuck it up because I\u2019ve talked too much about it.\u201d\nThus we ease into the evening\u2019s rhythm. The lights fade, Cave does a single song at the piano. The lights brighten and he gestures with weary elegance at a flashing baton to answer a question. He spins in slow circles because not only do tables press in cabaret-style around his piano, but the stalls behind the stage are filled too.\nThe layout gives him a dancing-bear captive air \u2013 which suits his efforts to place himself at our mercy. And at the mercy of an 11-year-old girl who asks \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest thing about what you do?\u201d He replies: \u201cWith live performance the terror of standing in front of people ... is incredibly addictive. But I grew to have a certain control over the outcome \u2026 these conversation events have brought back the terror. Because I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing. And here I am answering the questions of a child.\u201d\nSometimes he refuses requests \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t do the build on Jubilee Street\u201d or \u201ctoo many chords\u201d \u2013 but mostly, he says yes. Some he sings very well and others he inhabits. Most of the latter are newer songs \u2013 Higgs Boson Blues, Mermaids and Skeleton Tree \u2013 with the exception of the best rendition of The Mercy Seat I\u2019ve heard (or seen on YouTube), and an incendiary belting-out of God Is in the House.\nThe Weeping Song suffers from the tyranny of his distance to it. It\u2019s all plonky playing and affect. Another night you might not notice. Tonight, it jars due to how real he feels; up on his feet again to do the TEDx walk and talk.\nOur interactions fall into three categories. First, when he quips back: many are gently teased by Cave tonight. In these moments he\u2019s \u201cas funny as a circus\u201d (that\u2019s my dad, who I took, not Nick). \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need to clap after I answer each question?\u201d Cave suggests. \u201cI start to analyse the volume of each clap and, well \u2026 \u201d\nThe second is when he latches on to a topic and answers with depth and honesty. It\u2019s like a late-night D&M with a mate \u2013 only the mate is Nick Cave and we\u2019re yarning with the lights up amid a cast of thousands. \u201cWe\u2019ll all live two lives,\u201d he says in response to a comment about David Bowie\u2019s final years \u2013 when he was facing mortality and reaching out to connect with fans. \u201cIn his first life, he did what many of us do and put himself forward as an individual \u2026 then later he looked for something communal and collective. It\u2019s what happens to us all \u2026 I think we\u2019re united by suffering.\u201d\nThe \u201cgreat thrill\u201d of the creative process, meanwhile, is when something \u201cstarts to emerge from meaninglessness even when you don\u2019t see it at first. To be a creative person requires most of all, faith. Faith the moment will come. And when it does you can see it vibrating in front of your face\u201d.\nThe third category of interaction is tidbits about his music and collaborators. \u201cIt\u2019s really about loss, the Bad Seeds,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to look at them and not see the absences, now, of some towering figures.\u201d He names some who\u2019ve died and some who left the band: Blixa Bargeld, Conway Savage, Barry Adamson and Kid Congo. He talks about Brett Whiteley, Shane MacGowan, Tony Cohen.\nRowland S Howard\u2019s influence on guitar music globally has been \u201cvast\u201d, he says. \u201cHe was the first real game-changer for me and I owe him a huge amount for that.\u201d Their artistic collaboration was fierce; \u201cwe forgot how to be friends\u201d. He adds: \u201cThat\u2019s how the Birthday Party collapsed as a band. We forgot how to be friends.\u201d\n Cave says his work with Warren Ellis has deepened over the years. \u201cSomething special happens these days with Warren and I, where nothing can stop us if we\u2019re in a room together.\u201d Later, at a loss to name any new music he listens to (\u201cI\u2019m writing all day so I can\u2019t\u201d), he mentions their album. \u201cWe have something pretty cool brewing, me and old Wazza.\u201d\nIn no particular category falls the young fool who endears himself to Cave by asking to have his bare foot signed. \u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d he yells when Cave agrees. \n Ultimately, it\u2019s true: he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s an amateur again! Only this time we get to be there. A professional would be more energy efficient. They\u2019d know how to approximate questions, bridge to easier answers and recycle anecdotes. Instead of these pro moves, Cave instead chooses to not answer a few.\nHe struggles particularly with a question on male sexual predators. \u201cWho? I still don\u2019t know who do you mean?\u201d The man who asked tosses out Louis CK as an example. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on Louis CK,\u201d Cave says.\nJust as the question is washing out to sea however, Cave relents and tugs it back. \u201cLook, I\u2019m in no way cavalier about this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of it somehow having stained the music industry \u2026 where I don\u2019t recognise this way men are being painted as monsters. It seems to be an industry that respects women \u2013 in some way. Is that right?\u201d There\u2019s a rumble of protest but no eruption.\nHe\u2019s wrong on this point of course \u2013 and his thoughts on #MeToo are far better expressed here \u2013 but tonight\u2019s not about being right. It\u2019s about being present, knowable, vulnerable and real. And funny. Always that.\n Conversations With Nick Cave continues through January, in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and New Zealand",

        "content": "It was with a certain degree of inevitability that the first official encounter on a tennis court between Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios failed to pass without a whiff of controversy. After dominating a low-key hit-out in Melbourne, Tomic ensured post-match talk would not centre on the result but rather the comical manner of his victory after he played a sneaky underarm between-the-legs serve on match point.\nTomic, who was once world No 17 but plummeted down the rankings during a period of decline that culminated in a brief appearance on a reality TV show last year, faced Kyrgios \u2013 no stranger to controversy himself \u2013 in a much-hyped pre-Australian Open exhibition match at the Kooyong Classic. Now ranked 85, Tomic proved sharper than the 51-ranked Kyrgios and put himself in a winning position with little fuss.\nNeeding just one more point for victory, as he settled into his service stance, Tomic dropped a ball and hit it between his legs while continuing to bounce another ball, apparently in preparation to serve in the normal fashion. The unorthodox serve bounced in on the other side of the net, catching Kyrgios \u2013 as well as the umpire and the crowd at Kooyong \u2013 completely off guard.\nTHIS match point by Bernard Tomic in Kooyong \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/BhoFTMH3Gc\nAfter a moment of deliberation, the umpire announced game, set and match to Tomic, leaving Kyrgios to laugh in bewilderment and shake his head as he moved off the court. \u201cI don\u2019t think there has ever been a player like BT,\u201d Kyrgios said afterwards. \u201cIt is great to see him back out here as I know he was going through some rough times. He won a title last year and it looks like he is carrying a bit of momentum which is good to see.\u201d\nThe legality of the shot was not questioned by the umpire at the time, however according to the ITF\u2019s rules of the game, underarm serving only allowed if the ball is struck before it hits the ground. Tomic\u2019s effort appeared to bounce off the court before his racket struck it.\nThe Queenslander failed to qualify for last year\u2019s Australian Open but has won a place at next week\u2019s tournament at Melbourne Park thanks to his improved ranking. \u201cHe looks happy, he looks healthy. That\u2019s the main thing,\u201d Kyrgios added. \u201cYou never want to see a talent like that go down and keep being down.\u201d\nThe hit-out lacked intensity but Tomic\u2019s performance, particularly in the first set, was impressive, albeit coming against an opponent who appeared not yet to be up to tournament speed. Tomic broke Kyrgios in the fourth game of the match before going on to claim the first set and when he broke at 3-3 in the second, there was no looking back.\nThe outing, and the performances of other Australians elsewhere, gave both players reason for cheer before the Australian Open. \u201cWe could make deep runs at the Australian Open, but we\u2019ve also got Alex de Minaur [and John] Millman. We\u2019ve got so many players. It\u2019s an exciting time for Australian tennis,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got such a wide variety of players. We all play different. It\u2019s looking really really good.\u201d\nNot all onlookers were impressed with what they saw on Wednesday, however. Australian Olympian Georgie Parker labelled the efforts of the players \u201can absolute joke\u201d.\nWatching Kyrgios v Tomic at the @KooyongClassic... it\u2019s an absolute joke. I\u2019m paying money to be here and the two idiots aren\u2019t giving two shits. It\u2019s an exhibition match but you can still bet on it... How this isn\u2019t match fixing is beyond me. Get these two off the circuit.",

A frosty haze smokes through woods, across the brook that wriggles in tiny meanders \u2013 they call them \u201cgippols\u201d here in Ape Dale \u2013 to the Severn, through oaks that have stood for centuries in fields with millions of little green crop leaves that won\u2019t see out the year. The industrial spaces of almost bare boulder clay drift in the valley bottom are stitched together by threads of an old land.\nIt\u2019s a quiet day \u2013 still and chilly. A buzzard, dark and ponderous, settles in a tree outside the shadow where land rises westwards. On a bank above is a small field, a corner of relict meadow, on top of which a bowser is parked under an oak tree. The plastic water tank on its rusty trailer may have been left in the shade at the end of last summer\u2019s drought. The oak, rising from a hedge, may have been there for 500 years.\nOpen grown, its trunk, like a ruined stone tower glowing with silver-grey lichens, reflects sunlight, and its crown conceals another buzzard; this tree looks much older than taller oaks nearby. It is slowly changing shape, withdrawing into the earth to withstand the weather for a few more centuries. Its internal life of fungi and insects hollows it out, making an edifice that appears monumental on the outside but is a shell supported by a thin growing layer under the bark and foliage now folded tightly in bronzy green winter buds. Inside, the oak is a tomb, holding the ghost of a remembered landscape, filling with shadow darker than that cast by the Edge.\nThis tree is a repository of ecological memory, it grows in a dale that got its name from apiaries, beekeeping, honey-making in the savage sweetness of the middle ages. The acres of wildflowers needed for that have long gone and with them the culture that created the meadows under the auspices of Wenlock\u2019s monastery, leaving fragments of that world scattered around the dale. The bowser loses its function and agricultural ambition in its abandonment to become something placed in the old oak\u2019s orbit like an offering.",

Held by the LibDems until 2015, its student-heavy population turned decisively to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour in 2017, a year after registering the highest anti-Brexit vote for any seat outside London.\nThangam Debbonaire represents the constituency with an extraordinary 37,336 majority. Yet, the MP believes her margin could \u201cjust as easily disappear\u201d, arguing she had a votes windfall in 2017 from people impressed by Corbyn, students angry about fees, sheer hostility to the Conservatives, and, of course, Brexit.\nThe question is whether that coalition of voters is fracturing amid Labour\u2019s reluctance to articulate a position that is clearly anti-Brexit. A small group of students sitting in a Clifton cafe all insist they would not vote for Labour if there was a general election tomorrow, irritated, they say, by the party\u2019s equivocations on the issue.\nNicky Tarran, 18, a first-year undergraduate studying French and German, is acutely frustrated he was too young to vote in the 2016 referendum. \u201cEveryone in my year group, we had a political consciousness but we did not have a voice,\u201d he says.\nWhile he believes British politics is ultimately a choice between the Conservatives and Labour, he can\u2019t bring himself to say he\u2019d vote for the latter at the moment. \u201cI agree that the Labour leadership needs to be more pro-European,\u201d Tarran says. \u201cI agree that Corbyn needs to change his mindset.\u201d Above all, he wants Labour to \u201ccome out in support of a people\u2019s vote\u201d.\nNot all of the group the Guardian spoke to are Labour supporters, but they are all left voters. Amy Heley, a fourth-year undergraduate, is active in the Our Future Our Choice pressure group, which supports a second referendum. She says she was \u201cactivated by Brexit\u201d. Her arguments are rooted in a sense of disenfranchisement that would be familiar to many older Eurosceptics. \u201cA lot of us can agree that a lot of people are angry about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe feel like the establishment is totally against us.\u201d\nHeley, however, is a Green party member, and is standing for the party in her home town of Brighton in May\u2019s local council elections. \u201cI was voting Green before but I could have been persuaded,\u201d she says. Brexit was \u201cthe final straw\u201d in persuading her to join the Green party, although she adds she would still prefer a Labour government if it came down to a choice between Corbyn\u2019s Labour and Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives.\nAnti-Brexit activists and campaigners say there has been a stronger shift against Brexit in the area across all generations; quite a claim in a constituency that voted 79.7% in favour of remaining in the EU in the 2016 referendum.\nEileen Means, 67, who helped run a Bristol for Europe street stall in the city centre on Saturday, asked passersby to tick on a whiteboard whether they wanted to stay in the EU or not. Forty ticked yes, two don\u2019t know and nobody dared tick no. \u201cJudging by today\u2019s response, Bristol has swung even more pro-EU,\u201d Means concludes.\nHowever, Debbonaire says her correspondence is more nuanced. She estimates that the overall 80/20 proportion is not much changed, even if she gets very little pressure in her inbox about leaving the EU.\nShe has become aware of other, less noisy, groups who think it might be worth endorsing May\u2019s Brexit deal because they think some certainty is better than no deal. Debbonaire is thinking in particular of small traders, citing the example of a vintner that \u201cbuys all its wine from France and simply has no idea how it will manage\u201d.\nThe MP, a junior whip, holds relatively close to Labour\u2019s endlessly-restated formal position that May\u2019s deal needs to be voted down, that the party needs to press for a general election, and then and only then can all options \u2013 including a second referendum \u2013 be considered.\nShe says she recognises labour needs to assert itself more strongly over Brexit, but she is unclear that a second referendum is the answer. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen any signs of a campaign that would win a referendum convincingly, which is what would be required to put the argument to bed.\u201d\nOthers also wonder if a second referendum is too complex an answer when what they would like is to see is Britain remaining in the EU. Means, a former chair of Bristol Labour party, asks if it would not be better to simply revoke Article 50 \u201cwhile we come together as a country\u201d.\nSam Hickmott, 20, a self-employed gardener who chairs Bristol for Europe, complains that Corbyn\u2019s \u201cjob-first Brexit is a non-thing\u201d arguing that you are \u201ceither in the EU or out of it and on the same boat as Theresa May or David Davis\u201d.\nOnly Phil Jardine, 31, another member of Bristol for Europe and a member of the local Labour party, empathises with the party\u2019s leadership dilemma, saying there is \u201cno option which is a good option\u201d because there are so many people elsewhere in the country who are Labour voters who wanted out.\nDespite the wide range of views, Debbonaire remains popular in the constituency. Among the students in Clifton, Sally Patterson, the equality, liberation and access officer at the university\u2019s students union, describes the MP as \u201cone of my personal role models\u201d who is \u201ca listening MP\u201d.\nAlthough a Labour member, Patterson, 23, refuses to say she would vote for the party tomorrow because she is unhappy with the party\u2019s Brexit equivocations. \u201cI think what\u2019s going on right now with the Labour leadership is dangerous,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is not the party I signed up to, where the people would be listened to.\u201d",

Our rulings serve as an important notice to retailers and the clothing and textile industry about the need for truthfulness in their claims around faux fur products, and to get their house in order or face further action.\u201d\nClaire Bass, the executive director of HSI UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that compassionate consumers setting out to buy fake fur are being misled into buying animal fur.\n\u201cThese two examples are the latest in a long list of \u2018fake faux fur\u2019 items we\u2019ve found for sale, so we hope that the ASA\u2019s rulings will send a strong message to the industry and make retailers work harder to give consumers confidence in avoiding cruel animal fur.\u201d\nBoohoo said: \u201cWe have a strong commitment against the sale of real fur in any of our products. We have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure that we are able to adhere to this.\n\u201cFollowing the inquiry by HSI the item has been removed from sale. We continue to investigate the matter internally and with the supplier in question, as a matter of priority.\u201d\nZacharia Jewellers said it had been informed when it bought the products in China that they were faux fur.

The future awaits us! And everything will be better!\u201d Venezuela\u2019s embattled president insisted, declaring 2019 \u201cthe year of fresh starts\u201d.\nBut the sandbags and rifle-toting troops that now encircle the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas suggest far less confidence about the days ahead, as Venezuela sinks deeper into economic ruin and political isolation and questions grow over Maduro\u2019s future.\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 56-year-old heir \u2013 narrowly elected after his mentor\u2019s 2013 death and then again in disputed elections last May \u2013 will begin his second presidential term on Thursday, amid intensifying international condemnation of what critics call his illegitimate and authoritarian rule.\nLast week, a regional bloc known as the Lima Group turned up the heat, with 13 of its 14 members announcing they would not recognise Maduro\u2019s new six-year term and urging him to step down. Those countries included Brazil, whose new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is well-known for his hostility to Maduro and whose pro-Trump foreign minister recently called for Venezuela\u2019s \u201cliberation\u201d.\nThe US has also stepped up pressure ahead of what it calls Maduro\u2019s \u201csham inauguration\u201d with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, telling one Brazilian newspaper \u201cseveral things\u201d could be done to rid Venezuela of Maduro\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d regime. Pompeo did not specify what those \u201cthings\u201d might be but the remark echoed Donald Trump\u2019s thinly veiled threat that military action was possible if Maduro did not go voluntarily.\nDespite the rhetorical war \u2013 Maduro recently ordered his troops to prepare to rip out the hearts of \u201cimperialist\u201d invaders \u2013 observers still consider a foreign military intervention unlikely.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see boots on the ground,\u201d said Matias Spektor, an international relations specialist from Brazil\u2019s Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation.\nBut after years of dawdling, regional patience does appear to be running out, as the situation in Venezuela deteriorates and Latin American politics swerves to the right under leaders such as Bolsonaro, Colombia\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Duque, Chile\u2019s Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era and Argentina\u2019s Mauricio Macri.\n\u201cThe dynamics are changing and they are changing very fast,\u201d said Spektor, calling the rise of those politicians decidedly bad news for Maduro.\nSpektor said the Lima Group\u2019s unexpectedly firm declaration \u2013 which includes plans for financial sanctions, preventing top Venezuela officials entering their countries, and suspending military cooperation \u2013 appeared partly designed to persuade the Venezuelan military to abandon their commander-in-chief.\n\u201cFor the regime to collapse you need to get Maduro out of the country and you need to get the military to stop supporting the regime \u2026 The way you do that is by sending signals to the military that in the long run if they stick to Maduro and the regime they will lose power,\u201d he said.\nLatin American governments did not want regime change imposed by outsiders \u201cbecause they know full well it would backfire \u2013 but they do want to see regime change via peaceful means\u201d.\nUnder its new leftist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico has resisted joining the anti-Maduro offensive, a move decried by human rights activists and Venezuela\u2019s opposition. \u201cI don\u2019t stick my nose into other countries\u2019 affairs,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said last week, emphasizing Mexico\u2019s return to a foreign policy of non-intervention.\nBut most Latin American countries are moving in the opposite direction, leaving Maduro increasingly friendless in a region his Bolivarian predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, dreamed of uniting during the \u201cpink tide\u201d era of leftist rule.\nBrazil, in particular, looks poised to play a frontline role in the diplomatic push to force Venezuela\u2019s president out. \u201cIn the early days of the administration, my understanding is that people in the Bolsonaro government want to send a very clear and unequivocal signal that Maduro\u2019s costs in the region are about to go up,\u201d said Spektor.\nBrazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, hinted at that harder line this week arguing: \u201cYou have to face the threats, and the main one comes from non-democratic regimes that export crime, instability and oppression. You can\u2019t simply wish away dictatorships such as Venezuela and Cuba.\u201d\nBolsonaro\u2019s politician son, Eduardo, tweeted: \u201cThe noose is tightening around Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\u201d\nDavid Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said there was a growing sense that with the end of Maduro\u2019s first term and growing regional pressure the crisis was entering a new phase: \u201cBut nobody really knows just exactly what it amounts to.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say: \u2018You\u2019re illegitimate\u2019. But how much does that mean in the end? It doesn\u2019t look like any of the Lima Group members or the United States are going to close up their embassies or break off diplomatic relations,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey want Venezuela to return to democracy in some way \u2026 [and to stop] the mass exodus of Venezuelans \u2026 but I don\u2019t think they really have much of an idea how to do that.\u201d\nMaduro and his inner circle would be fretting over their increasing isolation \u201cand that\u2019s why you see them reaching out to the Russians and the Chinese continually\u201d, Smilde said. But any international effort to engineer a peaceful transition would founder unless Venezuela\u2019s fractured opposition united.\n\u201cUntil that happens, the government can kind of do whatever it wants \u2013 even a weak government can consolidate if it has no opposition.\u201d",

        "content": "When Eileen Pegg developed dementia in 2015, she became very anxious and easily agitated. Her carers at MHA Weston and Queensway care home  in Stafford were determined to find a way to make her happier, so they decided to see if music would help.\nThe care home, which is a specialist dementia care unit, has provided music therapy for more than 10 years, and these sessions have made a real difference to Pegg, according to care assistant Chloe Pugh. When Pegg, now 91, attended her first music therapy session in 2016, she was crying and unable to calm down. But immediately afterwards, Pegg was a \u201ccompletely different person\u201d, smiling and recalling dancing with her husband. \u201cWe can\u2019t eliminate her anxiety completely, but we can help to alleviate the symptoms for Eileen, and help her engage more with what\u2019s happening around her,\u201d says Pugh. By singing and clapping along to music or playing instruments at her weekly one-to-one classes, Pegg is calmer, which has encouraged her to participate in other activities, thereby improving her appetite and mood.\nPegg is not the only one to benefit from these sessions. More than 2,000 residents across MHA\u2019s 84 care homes take part in regular music therapy groups. And it\u2019s not just clinical music therapy that helps dementia patients: choirs, music groups and specialist apps are all beneficial.\nMusic uses different parts of the brain from language, so can be used to communicate with people with dementia, even if they no longer speak or seem to understand others\u2019 words. As a result, it can help them express feelings and ideas and interact with others. It also reduces social isolation and encourages more physical activity through dancing or moving to the music.\nResearch published last year by the International Longevity Centre UK (ILC) and the Utley Foundation found that music has significant physical and mental health benefits for those with dementia and helps them retain their speech and language skills longer.\n\u201cAnalysis showed that music helps to significantly minimise some of the symptoms of dementia, such as agitation, and can help to tackle anxiety and depression,\u201d says Sally Greengross, chief executive of the ILC.\nLittle wonder then, that the government wants to expand the use of music for dementia patients, as part of its drive to expand \u201csocial prescribing\u201d. The NHS long-term plan, published this week, promised to roll out social prescribing, including music and the arts. By April 2021, there will be over 1,000 trained social prescribing link workers and more in place by April 2024, with the aim that over 900,000 people are able to be referred to social prescribing schemes by then, the plan says. These link workers will connect patients to local groups and support services.\n\u201cResearch suggests music can help people with dementia reduce the need for medication or restraints, address agitation and help people and their families cope better with symptoms,\u201d says the health secretary, Matt Hancock. \u201cThis is the kind of good value, easy-to-use social prescription that I\u2019m fully behind and I fully support work that helps us move to more person-centred care \u2013 a key part of the NHS\u2019s long-term plan.\u201d\nBut it comes at a price: the King\u2019s Fund has pointed out that social prescribing can be more expensive to commission than seeing a GP in the short term. And on average, it costs MHA \u00a330 per person for each music therapy session in its care homes. With social care finances stretched to the limit, music is not a priority at many homes, while the availability of community-based choirs and interactive music groups for dementia patients is limited.\nIn a bid to make it easier for commissioners, care providers and patients to find out what services are available and to identify gaps, today sees the launch of the Music for Dementia 2020 campaign. The campaign\u2019s website will share best practice and research and will have a searchable database of suitable music activities for dementia patients. \u201cPart of developing the promotion of music for people living with dementia involves being smart about where we support resources, so we need to know where there\u2019s already good work happening,\u201d says Grace Meadows, the programme director at the Utley Foundation and a senior music therapist at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.\nBacked with \u00a31m from the Utley Foundation, with additional ongoing annual funding of \u00a3500,000, the campaign aims to increase public awareness and backing for music to be an integral part of all dementia care pathways. The funding will finance local and national projects, scaling them up, helping to introduce music where there is currently little or no existing provision as well as training the workforce. \u201cWe want everyone in the UK living with dementia to have access to the music that means most to them and for it to be accessible in the most appropriate and effective ways,\u201d says Meadows.\n\u201cFor some this will mean ensuring they have the right technology \u2013 allowing them to enjoy their favourite music wherever and whenever they want. For others it means being able to attend music groups and participate in music-making. For some, it may mean working with a music therapist. Music for people living with dementia isn\u2019t a nicety, it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d\nBack in Stafford, Pugh is clear about the importance of music to the lives of those she looks after. \u201cMusic is and will continue to be the heartbeat of care for our residents,\u201d she says.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care wants to expand social prescribing in the arts. And there are many museums, theatres and galleries already doing local outreach work that could be harnessed by government and commissioners.\nColchester Castle hosts monthly Dance for Parkinson\u2019s sessions, run by the Dance Network Association. Participants are taken to see different artefacts and then use stories behind the artefacts in the dance class. \u201cLots of the movements we use are specifically designed to target their [Parkinson\u2019s patients\u2019] areas of need, such as loosening the spine and muscles and encouraging the use of the voice,\u201d says Emma Meek, dance development manager at the Dance Network.\nTyne & Wear Archives and Museum runs three outreach programmes for health and wellbeing: one for those with mental health issues, another for supporting recovering addicts and those involved in the criminal justice system, and another for those aged over 55.\nThe Holburne Museum in Bath runs a dedicated programme for those with mental health difficulties and homeless people. Participants, many of whom are referred from Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust, take part in professional artist-led classes such as oil painting, and ceramics and can progress to becoming volunteer museum guides too.",

Over the previous few nights, gang members had already destroyed one of their vehicles, and torched dozens of city buses.\nBut when the assault came, there was little Rob\u00e9rio could do but watch the CCTV feed as a group of youths doused one of the co-op\u2019s kiosks and set it on fire.\n\u201cI was desperate,\u201d said Rob\u00e9rio. \u201cThat\u2019s our property \u2013 it\u2019s how we make a living and support our families,\u201d he said.\nAuthorities in the state of Cear\u00e1 have been overwhelmed by more than a week of violence, which has been most intense in the capital, Fortaleza, a metropolitan region home to 4 million people.\nSecurity forces say three rival drug gangs have come together to carry out more than 160 attacks in retaliation for a proposal to end the practice of separating gang factions inside Brazil\u2019s prisons.\nBuses, mail trucks and cars have been torched. Police stations, city government buildings and banks have been attacked with petrol bombs and explosives. On Sunday, criminals blew up a telephone exchange, leaving 12 cities without mobile service. Other explosions have damaged a freeway overpass and a bridge.\nThe rash of violence is an early challenge for new president Jair Bolsonaro, who swept to power with his tough-on-crime proposals, which include military takeovers of Brazilian cities and shoot-to-kill security tactics.\nPolice say that three suspects have been killed in shootouts and the outbreak has brought Fortaleza to a standstill: buses and taxis have stopped running, shops have closed for days and many frightened residents refuse to leave their homes.\nFive hundred national guard troops have been deployed to the region. Camilo Santana, the governor of Cear\u00e1 state, said on Monday that authorities have made 148 arrests in association with the attacks. At least 20 prisoners suspecting of ordering the violence have been transferred from state to federal prisons.\nDespite the chaos, the government said it would not pull back on its plan to combat gang activities in prisons.\nFortaleza and other cities in Brazil\u2019s north-east have seen homicides soar in recent years, as Brazil\u2019s most notorious gangs, the First Capital Command (known as the PCC in Portuguese) from S\u00e3o Paulo and the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) from Rio de Janeiro began to encroach on the region, which they are disputing with the Fortaleza-based Guardians of the State, and also the Northern Family from Amazonas state.\nThe PCC and the Red Command are locked in a bitter fight to control Brazil\u2019s drugs trade, and Fortaleza is seen as a strategic prize because it is the closest large port to Europe and Africa.\n\u201cWe used to only see this kind of savagery on television in Rio de Janeiro. Things used to be mellow here,\u201d said Rob\u00e9rio, who added that the mayhem had made him want to arm himself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complete chaos here and I feel like I\u2019m in the middle of the ocean without a life raft,\u201d he said.\nBolsonaro capitalized on such sentiments during the election, and proposed facilitating gun ownership and rewarding police for extrajudicial killings.\n\u201cBolsonaro promoted a war rhetoric throughout his campaign, which won\u2019t solve Brazil\u2019s problem with violence,\u201d said Renato S\u00e9rgio de Lima, the president of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security.\nBrazil\u2019s security forces are already violent and killed 5,000 people in 2017, an average of 14 a day.\nDe Lima said Bolsonaro, and many politicians before him, tend to propose more violence instead of more effective strategies such as investing in better intelligence capabilities for police investigations and reforming the draconian prison system.\nHe cited promise in justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro\u2019s proposal to investigate gangs\u2019 money laundering to suffocate them financially, but said that Bolsonaro\u2019s forceful proposals make violent cities like Fortaleza a \u201ctime bomb\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the local police and institutions that have to put out the flames of these politicians\u2019 warlike proposals,\u201d he said.",

The prize honours individuals for outstanding professional achievement, contribution to humanity, and commitment to Jewish values and Israel.\nAs part of his efforts to combat antisemitism, a soccer team owned by Kraft, the New England Revolution, will host Chelsea football club in a benefit match in Foxborough, Massachusetts, in May. All proceeds from the match, plus a \u00a31m personal donation from Kraft, will go to anti-hate projects.\nChelsea, which is owned by the Russian-Israeli businessman Roman Abramovich, launched a campaign last year to raise awareness and educate about antisemitism in football. This week, the club warned its supporters that it would take \u201cthe strongest possible action\u201d against antisemitic or racist chanting.\nKraft is the seventh person to be awarded the Genesis prize. Previous winners include the former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, sculptor Anish Kapoor and actor Natalie Portman.\nKraft said he was honoured to receive the prize. \u201cThis award amplifies my ability to raise both awareness and additional funds to fight antisemitism, attempts to delegitimise Israel and other forms of prejudices. It is important that we continue to support organisations that focus on combatting prejudices by building bridges and uniting people of different backgrounds.\u201d\nIsaac Herzog, the head of the Genesis prize selection committee and chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, said: \u201cI applaud Robert Kraft\u2019s decision to focus his energies and the Genesis prize award funds on combating antisemitism, the delegitimisation of Israel, and racially motivated hate crimes.\n\u201cThe rising tide of antisemitism is a threat not only to Jews, but to the very fabric of any democratic society where it is allowed to take place. We cannot be blind to history\u2019s lessons. The time to act is now.\u201d\nKraft bought the New England Patriots in 1994. In the past 25 years, the team has played in nine Super Bowls, winning five National Football League championships.\nThrough his foundations, Kraft has donated close to half a billion dollars to charity, focusing on education, healthcare and programmes that foster cultural diversity and interfaith understanding, said the prize\u2019s organisers. He is also one of the largest donors to Jewish and Israeli causes, and a major investor in the Israeli economy.\nAntisemitic incidents in the US increased by 37% between 2016 and 2017, according to FBI figures. In October, 11 Jews were killed in an attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\nIn the UK, more than 100 antisemitic incidents were recorded each month of 2018 by the Community Security Trust, which monitors attacks and abuse and advises the Jewish community on safety issues.",

Isn\u2019t he? Who by? \u2013 but Loyalties addresses far more subtle, interesting questions. How far should we go to protect those we love? Loyalty may be a noble instinct, the basis of friendships and families \u2013 but what is its price?\nThe narrative is passed between four characters, bound together by a complex web of dependencies and obligations. Twelve-year-old Th\u00e9o is smothering his pain with alcohol. He is split between two warring households, appeasing parents who have no space for his needs. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is his teacher, and her concern for him brings up memories of abuse in her past. Th\u00e9o\u2019s best friend Mathis joins his drinking sprees at the expense of his own wellbeing, while Mathis\u2019s mother, C\u00e9cile, blames herself for her son\u2019s self-destructive behaviour. As the story progresses, we get a suffocating sense of the trap closing, as all four try desperately to keep others from suffering.\nDe Vigan is a bestselling author in France whose prizewinning books blur the lines between fact and fiction. Nothing Holds Back the Night, published in English in 2013, explored the relationship between a daughter and her bipolar mother, and was based on the author\u2019s family. Loyalties is straightforwardly fictional, but shows real understanding of what it is like to be a child in an unsafe world. The writing has a psychological accuracy, particularly about children\u2019s inner lives, that made me think of Tessa Hadley. But her young characters are more vulnerable than Hadley\u2019s, grappling with the demands of caring for adults who are deeply, perhaps fatally, flawed.\nUnsurprisingly, the results are bleak; but the poignancy of the writing makes this a book to savour. When Th\u00e9o drinks, he feels as though he has \u201cleft his own body but is still holding it by the hand\u201d; Mathis catches his mother looking at him \u201cas though he has become an adult overnight and is preparing to depart for the other end of the earth\u201d. Loyalties may take an unsparing look at parental imperfection, but it is also a moving tribute to the power of those bonds of love.\n Loyalties by Delphine de Vigan, translated by George Miller, is published by Bloomsbury.

It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.\nWho decides on the Oscars?\nThe Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.\n\nHow many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?\nThere are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).\nEach of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.\u00a0\nWhat do Oscar winners win?\nThe Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:\u00a0it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.\u00a0\nFavourites have emerged, and the prospect of any genuinely surprising nominees unfortunately dims with each stop on the awards season freight train. With that in mind, here\u2019s a last-ditch appeal to the Academy on behalf of 11 performers who\u2019ve been snubbed by the awards-season-industrial complex \u2013 some on account of admittedly stiff competition, others because they appear in smaller, less Oscar-baity films that staged less robust PR campaigns, and a few, sadly, because the movies in which they appear aren\u2019t in English.\nYes, the race for best actress is as stacked with terrific performances as it\u2019s been in years, but the exclusion of Carey Mulligan from the conversation is as strange and egregious an oversight as they come. In Wildlife, the directorial debut from Paul Dano, Mulligan plays Jeanette, a 1960s housewife left to her own devices after her unemployed husband abandons her and her son to fight wildfires in the forests of Montana. In a narrative presented mostly from the perspective of Jeanette\u2019s teenage son, Joe, Mulligan gives the best acting performance of the year, male or female: she\u2019s fickle, fierce, combustible and impish, her tone of voice often oscillating from cheerful to coarse in accordance with the character\u2019s mood. In a story that\u2019s more or less about a kid coming to recognize and reckon with his parent\u2019s flaws, Mulligan plays Jeanette with a thrilling unpredictability that calls to mind Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence \u2013 and forces us, as viewers, to recount the moment we realized our parents were human, too.\nIn a film with a cast as numerous and decorated as Widows\u2019 ensemble \u2013 Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Carrie Coon, Bryan Tyree Henry, Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and Jacki Weaver are all here \u2013 it takes a real howitzer of a performance to stand out from the bunch. But in Steve McQueen\u2019s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, Daniel Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki do just that, occupying opposite ends of the film\u2019s vast and frequently fluctuating moral continuum. As Jatemme Manning, the mob enforcer to his brother Jamal\u2019s political campaign, Kaluuya oozes menace: to look into his eyes as he stares down a lackey spitting a few rap bars is to vow never to freestyle again. Debicki, meanwhile, is the film\u2019s heart, a damaged woman in thrall to her abusive mother and husband who joins the Viola Davis-led heist and convinces you her life depends it. Both performances, though overlooked by most awards bodies (save a few critics\u2019 groups), are emotionally rich but tactful, too, governed less by histrionics than meaningful glances and grimaces.\nThe star of the year\u2019s best film, Roma\u2019s Yalitza Aparicio, still has an outside shot at nabbing a best actress nomination. But in a crowded year for supporting actress, headlined by Regina King, Amy Adams and the women of The Favourite, Aparicio\u2019s co-star Marina de Tavira has fallen through the cracks. That\u2019s a shame, since what she does with her role as the matriarch of a household in turmoil is pretty breathtaking. Her character Sofia swings like a pendulum; she lets out strident commands (\u201c\u00bfAd\u00f3nde vas?\u201d she screams at her disobedient son); provides comic relief (watch her attempt to wriggle her Ford Galaxy between two trucks on a Mexico City freeway); and allows her character\u2019s compassion and dejection to surface in gestures both big and small, a vast arsenal of actorly gifts at her disposal. \u201cNo matter what they tell you, as women, we are always alone,\u201d she says to Cleo in a moment of desolation that\u2019s brilliantly, perhaps surprisingly, punctuated by a burst of drunken physical comedy. In the humble opinion of this writer, it was the year\u2019s second-best performance (a smidgen behind Mulligan).\nThe year\u2019s best, most cryptic villain \u2013 a personification of the \u201cyou v the guy she told you not to worry about\u201d meme \u2013 was Steven Yeun\u2019s Ben in Burning, the director Lee Chang-dong\u2019s hypnotizing adaptation of Haruki Murakami\u2019s short story. Think Jay Gatsby meets Patrick Bateman meets Dickie Greenleaf: Yeun plays this smooth-talking cosmopolite with a pathological charm that never quite reveals itself in full, which is precisely what makes the characterization so uniquely chilling and seductive. It\u2019s a testament to Yeun\u2019s commitment that Ben\u2019s veneer of disquieting swagger never breaks: he yawns, laughs, speaks, smokes, shakes hands and discloses his casual pyromania all with the same air of arrogant self-possession. Critics\u2019 groups out of Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto recognized Yeun as the year\u2019s best supporting actor, so perhaps it isn\u2019t asking too much that the Academy take note too.\nThis 20-year-old actor\u2019s debut in Josephine Decker\u2019s brilliant Madeline\u2019s Madeline is on par with Natalie Portman in Black Swan and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York, in the pantheon of art-and-life-blurring roles. A gifted actress in a New York City-based experimental theatre troupe, and a mercurial teenager on the verge of a psychotic break, Howard\u2019s Madeline is that rare characterization of an adolescent that\u2019s refreshingly unmoored from convention. Immersed in her subjectivity, we experience Madeline\u2019s sense of disorientation in the world and then watch her bring pain and suffering into uncomfortably sharp focus, particularly in a dramatic monologue in which she\u2019s asked to portray her own mother. In a year of outstanding film debuts from young female actors (Aparicio in Roma, Elsie Fisher in Eight Grade, Kiki Layne in If Beale Street Could Talk), Howard\u2019s was particularly noteworthy.\nIn the wake of the Golden Globes, Christian Bale may very well ride his win to a best actor Oscar, with Bradley Cooper and Viggo Mortensen trailing close behind. Each represents a different version of the kind of muscular, immersive leading performance the Academy likes to honor. What Lakeith Stanfield does in Boots Riley\u2019s Sorry to Bother You, however, is considerably different. As Cassius \u201cCash\u201d Green, an upwardly mobile telemarketer, Stanfield is often comically incredulous. Despite his ascent in the world of tech, things happen to Cash more often than he makes them happen, and Stanfield plays it with a certain affable bemusement. It\u2019s one of those performances that works in service of a film-maker\u2019s vision, in this case Riley\u2019s wild satire of a late-capitalist wasteland and its machine full of cogs.\nRare is a protagonist, especially a female, middle-aged protagonist, as multitudinous as Isabelle of Claire Denis\u2019 radiant romcom Let the Sunshine In, the lifeblood of which is Juliette Binoche\u2019s effusive, heartfelt and guileless lead performance as a woman looking for love. Isabelle, and as far as we can tell, Binoche too, feels everything to the fullest extent, and throughout the film, a dialogue-heavy procession of encounters with different men, her face is a transient canvas of emotions experienced not one-by-one but all at once. Watch her, for instance, in the film\u2019s final scene, a long discussion with a clairvoyant who predicts the future of Isabelle\u2019s various dalliances. His every divination is met with its own reaction: Isabelle\u2019s neck tenses up, or she laughs incredulously, or her smile broadens, or her lips purse. It\u2019s a nakedly human and life-affirming performance from one of our greatest actors.\nThe slow burn and eventual emotional gut punch of Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s Shoplifters is reflected most clearly in the supporting performance of Sakura And\u00f4, who plays her character, Nobuyo, with a delicate touch not dissimilar to the film\u2019s direction. She is sincere but necessarily stealthy, loving and devious, easily one of the most sympathetic and likable characters on film this year, which is odd if you come across a bare-boned synopsis of the movie: a family of savvy shoplifters kidnaps a young girl. In a scene where Nobuyo is interrogated by Japanese police, her eyes evince profound sadness and principled determination, like vectors for Kore-eda and the film\u2019s touching exploration of a family linked by trust instead of blood.\nIf it were up to me, Joaquin Phoenix would have two Oscars to his name and a third \u2013 for his performance as Joe in Lynne Ramsey\u2019s You Were Never Really Here \u2013 on the way. Alas, Phoenix\u2019s harsh, uncompromising turn as a hired gun who rescues sex-trafficked young girls has been mostly ignored by major awards bodies and critics\u2019 groups, even though he took home the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival, where the film premiered in 2017. Here, Phoenix and his body appear more lived-in than ever, the lines that branch across his face suggesting toil and trauma. With more action than talk, Phoenix and Ramsey invite us into the character\u2019s wounded headspace, effectively evoking the sense of rage and violent resolve that compels him to do what he does.\nAs if the best actress conversation weren\u2019t crowded enough, here\u2019s another tour de force to consider. As a kindergarten teacher and failed poet in Sara Colangelo\u2019s remake of the 2015 Israeli film of the same name, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the year\u2019s most anxiety-inducing performance, embodying obsessive compulsion and intellectual unease. Her character Lisa takes what seems like an innocent, maternal interest in the poetic ingenuity of one of her students, seeing it as her responsibility to cultivate his talent before it\u2019s soiled, presumably like her own, by an increasingly vainglorious world. What ensues is a crescendo of discomfiting events that are both more and less ethically ambiguous than they feel, anchored by Gyllenhaal\u2019s tremendous ability to be entirely consumed by her character\u2019s one-track mind and strange sense of duty.",

Subscribe to The Guardian Weekly\nIf you live outside a major town or city, you belong to a minority of people on the planet. According to the UN, 55% of the world\u2019s population are now urban dwellers, with that figure projected to rise to 68% by 2050. With the world becoming increasingly urbanised, a new wave of megacities \u2013 those with populations of 10 million or more \u2013 are emerging, and our Big Story this week tells the stories of three such behemoths in the making: Baghdad in Iraq, Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Xi\u2019an in China.\nAs the seasonal retail frenzy subsides, economic attention returned to the US-China trade war, which has caused markets to jitter around the world. The two parties returned to the negotiating table this week, but the ramifications of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy will hurt more than just the likes of Apple, which reported a profits slowdown last week. We look at the consequences for workers in the US and China, and for developing nations where China has invested heavily.\nThe civil war in Yemen that broke out in 2015 caught some by surprise, though its origins had been brewing for years. The overthrow of the US- and Gulf state-backed Yemeni leader Abed Rabbu Mansour Hadi by Houthi rebels quickly deteriorated into a regional proxy war involving Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Almost five years on, Yemen itself is now utterly shattered and, as Ghaith Abdul-Ahad reveals in a visceral long read, the UAE in particular has emerged as the victor from a scene of human and economic devastation.\nBrexit returned to the UK headlines this week after some brief seasonal respite, but we pause to reflect on a curious incident that affected Gatwick, the country\u2019s second-busiest airport, just before Christmas. Repeated sightings of drones being flown near the runway caused around a thousand flights to be cancelled or diverted over three days. But weeks later, the police trail has gone cold and some have even questioned whether there really were any drones at all. What lessons can be learned from this bizarre episode, asks the Guardian\u2019s home affairs correspondent Jamie Grierson.\nLastly, good news for dinosaur fanatics in the Washington DC area, as the long-awaited reopening of the Smithsonian museum\u2019s fossil hall nears following refurbishment. Pride of place will go to a giant beastie known as the Nation\u2019s T rex, the 4.5 metre-tall skeleton restored to upstanding glory for the first time in 66m years.",

        "content": "From magnanimous Mrs Wilcox in Howards End to the bloodthirsty Captain Bildad in Moby-Dick, these portrayals complicate porridge-oat stereotypes\nMention the Quakers, and often the image that springs to mind is the face of porridge oats: a white-haired man in a wide-brimmed hat. Modern Quakerism, it goes without saying, doesn\u2019t feature many people who look like that \u2013 although we still retain a reputation as trustworthy, unpretentious, wholesome and unthreateningly eccentric. Known officially as the Religious Society of Friends, from our Christian beginnings as the \u201cFriends of Light\u201d, the Quakers are a community without a priesthood or an official creed, but believing in truth, peace, simplicity and equality. Because we believe in everyone\u2019s direct, personal experience of God, we don\u2019t have set services; instead our worship takes place in unscripted Meetings, where the silence is broken only when someone (and it can be anyone) is inspired to say something.\nIn the light of our high ideals, it can be hard for individual Quakers not to feel inadequate. I certainly do. We\u2019re exhorted to \u201clet our lives speak\u201d, and I often feel like my life doesn\u2019t have much to say. But I am a writer. As a community that listens patiently for the truth, Quakers provide a unique place for creativity. The faith that can sit through hours of Meeting \u2013 through boredom, frustration, distraction \u2013 is the same thing that keeps me going when I\u2019m struggling for my next idea. We worship in silence, but we\u2019re waiting for words, which somehow gives me faith that, if I wait in front of a blank page for long enough, the right story will come.\nIt isn\u2019t only our relationship with silence that has shaped my writing. My novel The Binding was deliberately set in an alternative, secularist 19th century, where God doesn\u2019t figure even in oaths. But the book bindery to which the main character, Emmett, is sent is an austere sanctuary that enshrines the Quaker love of a job well done. The binder to whom he\u2019s apprenticed is prickly and plain-speaking, but utterly faithful to her principles; and through her wisdom he begins to understand that the only trustworthy moral compass is rigorous compassion. And finally, while I hesitate to claim that my novel is a Quakerly story \u2013 it\u2019s shamelessly romantic, indulgent, and a bit too brightly-coloured for that \u2013 perhaps its ultimate conclusion is the most Friendly of all: that truth and love are what save us in the end.\nHere are 10 Quakers in fiction \u2013 presented, in the light of our testimony of equality, with no intended hierarchy.\n1. Honor Bright in The Last Runaway by Tracy ChevalierThere\u2019s a lot to love about Honor Bright, starting with her name. Leaving her family and Quaker Meeting behind her, she travels from England to America to start a new life, where she\u2019s drawn into the Underground Railroad, the network that supported runaway slaves on their way to freedom. Although Honor finds solace in the quiet of Meeting, what really gives her strength is the grace of sincere friendship.\n2. Ruth Wilcox in Howards End by EM ForsterPerhaps it\u2019s surprising that in this novel it\u2019s not the plain-speaking, free-thinking Schlegel family but the wealthy first Mrs Wilcox who is of Quaker descent. She\u2019s unable to hold her own in discussion and apparently bewildered by social issues, but her decision to leave Howards End to Margaret shows inspired generosity and disregard for social mores.\n3. The Middleton siblings in Notes from An Exhibition by Patrick GaleA subtle and intelligent depiction of a modern family of \u201cbirthright Quakers\u201d as they come to terms with the life and death of their artist mother, this novel conveys the reality of a community of Friends, including the occasional ambivalence of its members. Gale calls Quakerism \u201cmystical but no-nonsense\u201d \u2013 an excellent description \u2013 and he excels in exploring the interior reality of silent worship.\n4. The people of the Dusty Miller in The Dazzle of Day by Molly GlossA surprising, lyrical science fiction novel in which a Quaker community sets off to settle a new planet. Told in austere and beautiful prose, the story of the spaceship Dusty Miller has a wonderful scene where the community makes a decision through worship \u2013 seeking not consensus but divine guidance \u2013 which depicts the way a moment of illumination can emerge unexpectedly from an apparent impasse.\n5. Sarah Grimk\u00e9 in The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk KiddBased on the real Grimk\u00e9, a vocal abolitionist and women\u2019s rights campaigner in the 19th-century US, this is a portrait of a woman learning to speak truth to power. Growing up in a slave-owning household, Sarah is struck dumb by the sight of a woman being whipped, and \u2013 driven by her relationship with Handful, a slave \u2013 she becomes convinced that her ministry is to fight for emancipation. Ironically, in real life she was expelled by her Quaker community for attending her sister\u2019s wedding to an outsider.\n6. Captain Bildad in Moby-Dick by Herman MelvilleA refreshing counter-example to the upstanding, idealistic Friends that feature elsewhere in this list, Captain Bildad is bitter, hard, avaricious and sanguinary, one of the \u201cfighting Quakers \u2026 Quakers with a vengeance\u201d. Opposed to bloodshed in principle, he has nonetheless spent his youth on the spillage of \u201ctuns and tuns of leviathan gore\u201d and retires to enjoy his substantial income.\n7. The Paxmore family in Chesapeake by James A MichenerThis novel follows the Quaker Paxmores through many generations, beginning in 1661, when Ruth Brinton Paxmore and her husband Edward are imprisoned and tortured for their beliefs. Later, predictably, the family face conflict over slavery and warmongering, but my favourite part of their story is Edward\u2019s development from a carpenter to a shipbuilder \u2013 forced to invent a boat from first principles, he fails over and over again before he becomes a true artist.\n8. May Thornton in Things a Bright Girl Can Do by Sally NichollsIn this touching and funny book for young adults about the suffragist movement and the outbreak of the first world war, May (born to a mother who is not only a Quaker but a vegetarian, Fabian, suffragist, Bolshevik and believer in rational dress for women) is forced to choose between her high principles and her love for Nell, a girl who goes to work in a munitions factory.\n9. Andrew Raynes in The Charioteer by Mary RenaultA conscientious objector who works in a military hospital, where he falls in love with Laurie, the protagonist, Andrew is endearingly guileless and wholehearted. While a modern audience might wince at the way he has to be \u201cprotected\u201d from the realisation of his own homosexuality (the self-knowledge, it\u2019s suggested, might destroy him), Renault does a great job of making this idealistic young man unexpectedly charming.\n10. Susanna Thorn in No Shame, No Fear by Ann TurnbullA young adult novel set in 1662, this is a love story about Susanna, a Quaker, and Will, the son of a wealthy family. It\u2019s also a vivid evocation of the persecution early Quakers faced, and a reminder that some of what seems quaint now (refusing to doff one\u2019s hat, the use of \u201cthee\u201d to one\u2019s social betters) was once truly radical and subversive.\n The Binding by Bridget Collins is published by HarperCollins, priced \u00a312.99. It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a311.43, including free UK p&p.",

        "content": "Government commits to review laws on use of drones around airports after Tuesday sighting caused one-hour halt\nPolice hunting those behind a drone flight at Heathrow are investigating whether it was carried out by the same person or group that caused chaos at Gatwick in the run-up to Christmas or if it was a copycat crime.\nThe sighting of the drone just after 5pm on Tuesday caused Heathrow managers to order an emergency one-hour halt of flights taking off.\nThe drone\u2019s short incursion around the north runway was witnessed by police officers, giving police chiefs confidence that it was real and not the result of a mistaken sighting.\nThe device was larger than that seen at Gatwick just before Christmas. After the drone disappeared, measures and equipment stationed at Heathrow were activated which airport bosses hope will neutralise any threat to passenger planes.\nOfficials trying to deter the drones will not know for sure how well the mitigation measures work until they have to deal with another drone sighting, but have studied what worked and did not work at Gatwick.\nThe police also appealed to the public for information about the operator of the drone.\nOn Wednesday the government underlined its commitment to toughen laws on the use of drones around airports after the military had to be deployed at Heathrow following the drone sighting.\nThe de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, said ministers were reviewing the legislation after the Heathrow incident raised fears of a repeat of the chaos witnessed at Gatwick before Christmas, when drone sightings caused flights to be suspended for days.\nAsked about the Heathrow incident on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday, Lidington said: \u201cClearly, the government is looking at the law to see whether there are ways in which it could be strengthened.\nHe added: \u201cWhat I think the airports themselves have to do is step up and do more of is investment in technology to both detect and then stop drones from flying.\u201d\nThe Department for Transport confirmed that the aviation minister, Liz Sugg, and the security minister, Ben Wallace, are due to meet the heads of UK airports on Thursday to discuss resilience against drone attacks.\nA spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government will continue to work closely with a range of stakeholders from industry to explore technical solutions and improve security measures.\u201d\nHeathrow said flights were operating as normal on Wednesday morning. Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan police said: \u201cMilitary assistance has been implemented to support us. However, we will not be discussing in any further detail the range of tactics available to us as this would only serve to potentially undermine their effectiveness.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPolice officers were amongst those who saw the drone and a full criminal investigation has been launched. We are carrying out extensive searches around the Heathrow area to identify any people who may be responsible for the operation of the drone.\u201d\n The British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association said the incidents at Gatwick and Heathrow demonstrated the need for tougher regulations.\nRob Hunter, its head of flight safety, said: \u201cThe costs of these incidents is going to add to the incentive to take this hazard much more seriously.\u201d Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday, he said: \u201cThe segregation of drones and commercial airliners needs to be better ensured.\n\u201cThe rules are not pretty strict; they are pretty lax, actually. Currently a drone can operate within 1km of an airfield boundary and that could actually mean that the drone is above approaching aircraft and departing aircraft.\n\u201cThat 1km boundary needs to be extended right out to 5km. The government announced that they intend to do that, so I think the Gatwick incident has helped.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe frustration is that what we have seen is an expansion of this technology, but what hasn\u2019t kept pace is managing the hazard of it.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, announced measures to give police extra powers to combat drones, including extending a drone exclusion zone around airports.",

        "content": "Tottenham have announced further delays to their late-running \u00a31bn stadium and it is highly unlikely they will be able to move to their new home before mid-March at the earliest.\nThe club have used Wembley as a temporary home since the start of last season and they have now confirmed they will play another sequence of fixtures there \u2013 namely the Premier League games against Watford (30 January), Newcastle (2 February) and Leicester (10 February), together with the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Dortmund (13 February).\nIf Spurs were to win at Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fourth round at the end of this month, there is the possibility they could get a home tie in the next round on the weekend of 16-17 February. That would also be staged at Wembley.\nThe club\u2019s subsequent home game would be the derby against Arsenal on 2 March and there is no chance of them being allowed to open the stadium that day. They want the grand opening to go smoothly and the Metropolitan police and security personnel have made it clear that the most troublesome fixture of the season would be too great a risk.\nAll of which leaves the home league game against Palace on 16 March as the best-case scenario, although that would clash with a possible FA Cup quarter-final.\nThe chairman, Daniel Levy, said: \u201cI should like to apologise to our fans and thank you for your continued patience. The response from those who attended the familiarisation event [on 15 December] was great to hear and reinforced our commitment to deliver an exceptional matchday experience for everyone. We shall now seek clarity in respect of building test schedules and test event dates and provide further information on these in the next two to three weeks.\u201d\nIt feels like a long time ago that the hoped-for move-in game was Liverpool on 15 September. The club said in August that they would stay at Wembley until the end of October and they would subsequently extend that arrangement until the end of 2018.\nIn mid-December, they said that the Manchester United game this Sunday would also be played at Wembley. The major issues have been to do with the stadium\u2019s critical safety systems but there have been numerous other problems. Levy has had to pay increased rents at Wembley this season and they have contributed to the spiralling costs of the project.\nIn PR terms it has been a disaster, while there has been mutterings of disquiet from some of the other clubs in the Premier League. Manchester City were unhappy to be messed about over the timing and venue of their away fixture with Spurs, which was eventually designated for Wembley on Monday 29 October, with an evening kick-off, because the national stadium was taken up the day before by an NFL game. City paid for coach travel to London for their supporters and they asked Spurs whether they would like to contribute. Spurs said no.\nMore recently, the Cardiff manager, Neil Warnock, argued Tottenham ought to remain at Wembley for the remainder of the season, as to move now would offer a competitive advantage to the relegation-threatened clubs that still had to play them away.\nWarnock\u2019s theory was that when Spurs did move, it would take them time to settle and visiting teams would benefit. Mauricio Pochettino countered that by saying his team would be boosted immediately when they moved but, in which case, the relegation-threatened teams that still had to visit them would surely be disadvantaged. That said, Spurs have beaten every team they have already played from the bottom half of the table at Wembley.",

The 45-year-old takes over from Gary Rowett, who was sacked on Tuesday after less than eight months in charge.\nThe decision to turn to Jones represents a significant shift in Stoke\u2019s approach to managerial appointments, given the value that they have previously placed on experience. That strategy has not worked, however, and has resulted in Mark Hughes, Paul Lambert and Rowett leaving their positions in the space of little more than a year.\nJones is not a high-profile name but he has a burgeoning reputation after impressively turning around Luton\u2019s fortunes following his appointment in January 2016. The Welshman led Luton to promotion from League Two last season, after missing out in the play-offs the year before, and they are currently second in League One.\nNathan Jones is the new manager of Stoke City, the Club are delighted to confirm.Read more \u27a1\ufe0f\u00a0https://t.co/MKrUKTByrq#SCFC \ud83d\udd34\u26aa\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/ZAWuF2iNqN\n\u201cI have a very good knowledge of the Championship and that is why I felt very comfortable in taking this role on, even though I fully understand the challenges of being successful at this level,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is a tough league, it is a Premier League 2, it isn\u2019t a Championship, every game is tough because you are either facing a side battling to survive or facing somebody trying to get into the top six and win promotion.\n\u201cThere are no dead rubbers, that\u2019s for sure. I am excited about this challenge, though. This is the next part of my journey and I absolutely believe that we can all enjoy a really successful future together.\u201d\nJones inherits a team languishing in 14th place in the Championship, well below the expectations of the club\u2019s board, who had targeted an immediate return to the Premier League after relegation last season. With Stoke only eight points outside the play-offs, that objective could still be achieved if Jones makes an immediate impact, starting with Saturday\u2019s trip to Brentford.

        "content": "Ill health among their horses has prompted the two trainers to cut back on runners and others may have similar problems\nIt\u2019s that time of year when it becomes apparent that some yards are operating way below their usual level and, in some cases, ill health among the horses emerges as the explanation. Both Anthony Honeyball and Rose Dobbin are, alas, in that situation and apparently we won\u2019t be hearing much from them until February at least.\nHoneyball\u2019s problems are said to have begun early in December and therefore provide a possible excuse for his Ms Parfois, who faded right away in the closing stages of the Ladbrokes Trophy and was beaten 40 lengths into sixth. Honeyball has had just one runner in the first eight days of the year and, although Mistress Massini was a winner for him at Ludlow on Thursday, he does not plan to run any horses other than her this month.\nIn a message posted on his website, Honeyball says Mistress Massini came into training late and, as a result, has been the only one of his horses to have been in full training for the last month, the others being \u201cstill on the easy list after suffering from a mild virus\u201d.\nThe Dorset trainer continues: \u201cWe decided to give our team a winter break on the advice of our vet early in December after a number of our horses, including Ms Parfois and Acey Milan, ran well below expectations. They spent a couple of weeks with a daily walk round the roads and are now back doing a steady canter or two. While they seem to be over whatever was affecting them, we will not be rushing things and do not expect to have any runners bar Mistress Massini until the end of January at the earliest.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Northumberland-based Dobbin has told the Racing Post: \u201cWe\u2019re giving the horses a quiet time because we suspect we\u2019ve got a bug and we won\u2019t have any runners for a couple of weeks.\u201d The trainer is making the most of it by awarding herself a pre-Brexit trip to Spain.\nLingfield\u00a0\n12.50 Temple Of Wonder \n1.25 Sea Of Reality 1.55 London Rock \n2.30 Court House 3.05 Very Honest \n3.40 Global Wonder\nDoncaster\u00a0\n1.00 Talkischeap 1.35 Uno Mas (nap) 2.10 Before Midnight 2.45 Diamond Gait 3.15 Fifty Shades 3.50 Cara\u2019s Way\nTaunton\u00a0\n1.10 Sign Of War (nb) \n1.45 Legal History 2.20 Still Believing \n2.55 Style De Garde 3.25 Shantou Flyer 4.00 Milldean Silva\nKempton\u00a0\n4.15 Admirable Art 4.45 Creationist 5.15 Alkaamel 5.45 Unit Of Assessment 6.15 Cenotaph 6.45 Dotty Grand 7.15 Briyouni 7.45 National Glory\nTips by Chris Cook\nChristian Williams is faring rather better, having sent out four winners from his last nine runners from his newish base by the coast between Cardiff and Swansea.

But it was a good run in any case and this step up in trip promises to suit.

        "content": "Closure of agriculture department offices could not have come at a worse time for farmers awaiting emergency federal aid \nJust as American farmers thought Donald Trump had rescued them from the economic consequences of his trade war with China, along came the government shutdown.\nThe National Farmers Union said the closure of agriculture department offices could not have come at a worse time for members awaiting emergency federal aid principally to compensate for a sharp drop in soybean prices after sales to China plunged as a result of trade sanctions on Beijing.\nThe shutdown has also created a new wave of uncertainty in planning for the planting season because crucial end of year agricultural data will now not be released on schedule.\n\u201cThis is a bigger than normal challenge because agriculture has been in a five year profit decline,\u201d said Roger Johnson, the president of the National Farmers Union representing about 200,000 family farmers and ranchers.\n\u201cNet farm income is half of what it was five years ago. Financial conditions are very difficult for a lot of farmers. There\u2019s a lot of stress out there. It\u2019s been exacerbated by what\u2019s gone on in the trade arena as market prices have gone down. And now we have the shutdown.\u201d\nThe most immediate impact is on farmers waiting for payments as part of a $12bn government package to help offset the impact of the trade dispute with China. US soybean sales into the world\u2019s largest market have plummeted since Beijing increased the tariff on American imports by 25% in July as part of the trade dispute with Trump. That hit American farmers hard because many of them have increasingly relied on soybeans as relatively profitable after years of decline in the price of most other crops.\n\u201cSoybeans were holding their own until the summer,\u201d said Aaron Heley Lehman, a fifth generation Iowa crop farmer. \u201cWhen the trade situation went into the ditch, prices dropped 20%. So one thing that farmers were actually holding their own and making a little money on started disappearing. The entire situation is as serious as it\u2019s been in many many years for famers. The collapse of the soybean trade and the government shutdown couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\u201d\nThe Farm Service Agency office, which pays out the assistance from the Market Facilitation Program, is now closed. Johnson said that many of those farmers who have already registered for payments have yet to receive them even though the first tranche of money went out in November. In addition, the deadline for farmers to sign up for the aid is 15 January. Those that have not already done so are uncertain whether they will be able to if the government shutdown continues.\n\u201cThese payments in many cases are very much depended on in order for folks to get through the year and pay loans and so forth,\u201d said Johnson.\nLehman, who is president of the Iowa Farmers Union, said the timing of the shutdown creates an additional burden because it comes just as farmers are planning this year\u2019s crop.\n\u201cThis is the time of year farmers work with their bankers or other lenders and they work with their suppliers. It\u2019s very frustrating when farmers are under extreme financial stress. All decisions are being made under the situation where things are just on hold until USDA offices open again,\u201d he said.\nIf the shutdown drags on it may also threaten implementation of parts of the 2018 farm bill designed to help smaller dairy farms which have been battered by a sharp downturn in the dairy industry.\nThe closure of agriculture department offices has put on hold the release of statistics and crop reports on which farmers and traders depend for planning and setting prices. Key among them is the world agricultural supply and demand estimates which was scheduled to be released this Friday. The report is a big driver of futures prices as traders look to it for crop forecasts not only in the US but other major producers such as the European Union, Russia and Brazil.\nJohnson said that will only add to the uncertainty already driven by the trade disputes and probably drive crop prices down further if the closure continues.",

        "content": "As wolves arrive in California for the first time since the 1920s, ranchers try non-lethal methods to deter animals once seen as livestock-killing vermin\nBreanna Owens had no idea where to turn for help when the wolves arrived. The northern California-based rancher used to take her cattle to graze each summer in Oregon, but in 2014, OR-7, a solitary wolf dubbed Journey, found a mate and produced a litter of pups in the vicinity of Owens\u2019 herd. The Rogue pack was the first in the area in generations.\n\u201cAll of a sudden it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, he set up camp. And there\u2019s a female. And there\u2019s pups \u2013 oh my gosh!\u2019\u201d she recalled.\nFour years later, Owens again finds herself in wolf country. Another pack has settled in the northern California mountains where she and other ranchers graze sheep and cattle. It\u2019s news that has environmentalists celebrating \u2013 wolves were extirpated from the state in the 1920s \u2013 and ranchers wringing their hands amid a handful of livestock killings.\nBut Owens is taking a remarkably contrarian tack: rather than calling for the removal of wolves, she\u2019s working to ensure safe coexistence with the canines.\nTop: Breanna Owens tends to her horses on her ranch in Los Molinos, California. Below left: Owens cares for the livestock on her ranch. Below right: Ranchers like Owens have to protect the animals on their ranches.\nGray wolves were long seen as livestock-killing vermin and were driven nearly to extinction by the early 1900s. They were listed as endangered in 1978, and in 1995 a reintroduction effort began in Yellowstone. Packs have since established themselves throughout the northern Rocky Mountains and in Washington and Oregon.\nWhen the Rogue pack arrived, Owens had plenty of questions: did she need to be concerned? What actions could she take? When would the wolves start exhibiting hunting behavior?\nOwens turned to an unlikely ally: Karin Vardaman, then a director with the California Wolf Center, a not-for-profit group dedicated to rebuilding the state\u2019s long-lost wolf population. Vardaman knew conflicts over wolves were imminent, and that a working relationship with ranchers would both minimize cattle predation and the chance of wolves being killed in retaliation. Accordingly, she began meeting with livestock producers across the state\u2019s northern reaches.\n\u201cPeople in urban areas get excited,\u201d said Vardaman, now with the advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife. \u201cBut they\u2019re not impacted when wolves return.\u201d\nOwens and a ranch apprentice, Brykelle Lang, set out electrified wire to protect livestock from mountain lions and coyotes.\nShe formed the Working Circle Proactive Stewardship, and Owens eventually signed on as its director. It suggests a suite of non-lethal wolf deterrents, including fladry (small red flags) and flashing lights, which can startle predators, and guard dogs. It teaches tactics such as bunching cattle together and rotating them around grazing areas, which not only keeps wolves at bay, it also better allows grass to regenerate. And it trains and funds range stewards, who spend time in the field with cattle, observing how best to manage the herd and protect it from predators.\nThe question could not be more pressing: the new California pack, the Lassen pack, now consists of at least two adults, two yearlings and five pups, and has killed at least four calves since July.\nTodd Swickard suffered one such depredation. On 19 September, one of his ranch hands found a partially consumed calf, which state biologists confirmed was killed by a wolf. Swickard was in the process of shipping his cattle out of their summer grazing terrain, so there wasn\u2019t much risk of further losses. But the specter of wolves\u2019 continuing presence bothers him.\n\u201cThey\u2019re mostly nocturnal hunters, so it\u2019s tough sleeping at night,\u201d Swickard said. \u201cYou wonder if they\u2019re in the middle of your livestock, and we\u2019re charged with the husbandry and care of those animals.\u201d\nArea livestock producers feel their hands are tied if wolf numbers continue growing. Federal and state laws prohibit lethal recourse against wolves. Plus California lacks robust deer and elk populations such as those in Oregon and Idaho, so ranchers think their herds will be the top option on the wolves\u2019 menu. \u201cThe wolves have to eat,\u201d the rancher Daren Hagata said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the wildlife populations \u2026 they\u2019re going to come after your livestock.\u201d\n\u201cOnce [wolves] get in and start harassing the cows, especially on a regular basis, weight gains go away, conception rates go down,\u201d said another rancher, Jack Hanson. \u201cThat\u2019d be my biggest worry, even more than the mortality issue.\u201d\nWith lethal action off the table \u2013 at least legally \u2013 ranchers are slowly coming to the realization they must try other methods. Owens spends a good deal of time meeting with ranchers in the area to educate them about Working Circle services.\nDespite work that might be seen as advocacy for wolves, Owens is ambivalent about their presence. Her efforts are grounded as much as anything in the realization that wolves are not going anywhere.\n\u201cYou like wolves, just like any other wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you see confirmation of pups, you get that sinking feeling. How\u2019s this going to go? How many cows are we going to lose? How many wolves are we going to lose?\u201d\nTop: A remote camera captured a photo of OR-7 in eastern Jackson county, Oregon. Below left: Wolf pups from the Wenaha pack. Below right: A male wolf from a pack known as the Wenaha pack near Oregon\u2019s Wenaha river.\nFor examples of the methods Owens preaches, ranchers in the Lassen pack\u2019s orbit could look north. Since 2016, Scott Sumner has served as a Working Circle-funded range steward for the Hart Ranch, which his sister, Susan Hart, owns. Sumner patrols Hart\u2019s summer grazing meadows by foot and mountain bike, accompanied by his nine-month-old collie, Rachel. Sumner\u2019s job was an urgent addition \u2013 in 2015, the Shasta pack became the state\u2019s first wolf pack in nearly a century, and the Hart Ranch was squarely in its range.\n\u201cMy job is to know this landscape better than the cows and wolves,\u201d Sumner said. \u201cIf I notice a change in the cows\u2019 behavior, my radar goes up.\u201d He keeps the cattle bunched tightly, rotates them between meadows, and is constantly seeking to minimize threats by, for example, thinning trees near salt licks to reduce odds of a wolf ambush. He checks a network of 14 trail cameras in the area, one of which snapped a photo this summer of OR-44, one of two lone wolves ranging through California.\nTop: Owens drives around her ranch in Los Molinos. Below left: Metal posts are used to hold electrified wire. Below right: Red flags known as \u2018fladry\u2019 act as a deterrent to predators on the ranch.\nSince Sumner began range riding, the Harts have suffered no wolf depredations, and the pack appears to have disappeared, though the state hasn\u2019t confirmed whether the wolves dispersed on their own or were poached. No other pack has established itself. \u201cWho knows?\u201d Sumner said. \u201cMaybe there are no wolves here because I\u2019m around.\u201d\nSumner understands the cattle he watches over would be at risk if wolves returned, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019d be disappointed to see another pack. Shortly before the state confirmed the Shasta pack\u2019s existence, a wolf trotted ahead of Sumner\u2019s pickup, not 20 meters away, as he was driving near the ranch\u2019s grazing meadows. \u201cWhen I first saw it, it was pretty much just surprise \u2013 that\u2019s a damn wolf! I was excited for 24 hours,\u201d he said.\nI asked Sumner how seeing the wolf made him feel, and it took him some time to elaborate. Earlier in the day, he had lamented how some wolf advocates glorified the species. But when describing his emotions when he saw the wolf three years ago, reverence crept into his tone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a wolf-hugger,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cBut they do symbolize a part of this country that I don\u2019t want to see ever lost. I understand why they\u2019re revered, and why they\u2019re hated. I want to do what I can do, in what little time that I have, to help them be here.\u201d\nThis story was co-published with Pacific Standard, an editorial partner site.

        "content": "A new biopic of Colette starring Keira Knightley explores the enduring appeal of the French novelist, polymath and style legend\nOpen Colette\u2019s Wikipedia entry and \u2013 just as with one of her novels \u2013 you\u2019re hooked right away. \u201cShe was a French author and woman of letters, also known as a mime, actress and journalist, nominated for the Nobel prize in literature in 1948.\u201d She wrote more than 30 novels and was called \u201cthe greatest living French writer of fiction\u201d by the New York Times, just before her death in 1954.\nThat\u2019s not to mention her status as the ultimate cat lover. Thanks to Colette, feline fans on Instagram have an almost endless supply of quotes for captions (\u201cOur perfect companions never have fewer than four feet\u201d is a personal favourite). The other accolade missing from that impressive CV? Style icon.\nColette, born in 1873, came of age as photography became popularised. When the cheap and easy-to-use Kodak Brownie became available in 1900, she was 27 and already a personality in Paris.\nShe was photographed in thinker\u2019s pose at her desk in a polka dot blouse; lounging with two cats and matching feline eye makeup; smoking in a man\u2019s suit; in black stockings and dancewear backstage before a performance \u2026 In almost every picture, her kohl-rimmed eyes meet the viewer\u2019s (and the photographer\u2019s, more than likely a man) with confidence. Colette offers a lesson in how a woman can use style to take ownership of her image \u2013 ensuring that she always has the last word.\nColette famously drew on her colourful life for her novels, including her experience of being a dancer in music halls (The Vagabond) and having an affair with a much younger man (Ch\u00e9ri and The Last of Ch\u00e9ri); the breakthrough Claudine series was inspired by her school days. The expressive \u201cthis is me\u201d shrug of her attitude is just as refreshing today as it was more than a century ago. It cuts through the decades much like her way of wearing men\u2019s tailoring \u2013 in soft velvet with lashings of eye makeup and jaunty neckscarves.\nColette, the new biopic in cinemas this week with Keira Knightley in the title role, focuses on the author\u2019s formative years. Growing up in the Burgundy countryside, she met Henry Gauthier-Villars AKA Willy, a controversial author and socialite who was an acquaintance of her father\u2019s. He was 14 years her senior; they married in 1893. As the film tells it, Colette used fashion as a way to express her transformation from a country girl in frills and long plaits to Parisian It-girl with a bob and a trouser suit (sidenote: Knightley\u2019s leg of mutton blouses and cropped boleros could also work in 2019).\nAndrea Flesch, the film\u2019s costume designer, says Colette\u2019s style reflected not only her journey, but also the shifts in society at the turn of the century.\n\u201cThis period changed quite often; the shapes changed every two or three years,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cIt was a very interesting time in fashion, the 1890s-1910s.\u201d Colette, however, had her own style. \u201cShe was as free [with clothes] as she was in everything.\u201dThis was the era when Colette was busy writing down the memories of her school days as the Claudine novels. While these were credited as being by Willy, they were bestsellers \u2013 spawning everything from Claudine-branded soap to dolls of the character and a a proto-Britney Spears fashion for grown-up women to wear the black-and-white schoolgirl uniforms of the era. Colette wrote the words but Willy saw the commercial opportunities. \u201cHe was a huge marketing man, really amazing,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cIt seems so modern for such a long time ago.\u201d\nThe author herself was no slouch when it came to branding, either. Born Sidonie-Gabrielle, she became known by only her surname while she was still at school, recognising way before Madonna that a single moniker announces your importance from the get-go. After she separated from Willy, who famously plagiarised his wife, in 1906, this approach helped her as she became a giant of French literature.\nThose taking style inspiration from novelists such as Colette reflect a wider, more highbrow trend in fashion: US novelist Joan Didion featured in a Celine campaign in 2015; French New Wave director Agn\u00e8s Varda is the cover star of The Gentlewoman autumn edition, while painter Georgia O\u2019Keefe\u2019s personal style was featured in the New Yorker last year.\nTerry Newman, in the coffee table book Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore, describes how Colette used clothes to \u201cradiate character, both in her own life and in the lives of the characters she created in her writing\u201d.\nThat influence has endured in some surprising ways, from retail to Hollywood: she lent her name to Colette, the cult Parisian boutique that became an industry favourite before closing after 20 years in 2017. And Colette discovered Givenchy muse Audrey Hepburn, casting the almost-unknown actor in the stage version of her novel Gigi in 1951.\nAlways in the avant garde, Colette was also a pioneer in her acceptance of androgyny and sexuality that was, then, taboo: the film shows the author\u2019s relationship with aristocrat Mathilde de Morny, or Missy, who was gay and wore men\u2019s clothes.\nFlesch says Missy changed Colette\u2019s style \u2013 a moment dramatised in the biopic when Knightley wears a pair of cycling culottes to stroll around a Parisian park. \u201cWearing trousers was a statement from Missy,\u201d says Flesch. \u201cShe was scandalous, and she was accepted because she was a noblewoman and rich. Colette wanted to show she was on the same level. She wanted to shock as well.\u201d\nStyle isn\u2019t a footnote of Colette\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s a central part of it. Sixty-five years after her death, her influence extends beyond your bookshelf, Instagram captions and cinema: Colette\u2019s free spirit is inspiring our wardrobes, too.\nColette is released in the UK this week",

They propose that commonism, as a principle or an idea, offers a potential future of both radical equality and radical freedom.\nFor an hour, sitting at either side of a table, Smith and Sveen perform a scripted conversation distilled from their own lengthier exchanges. Pages are turned and ideas genially debated: economic systems and wealth distribution, politics and the demos, nations and borders, labour and automation.\nI doubt that much here would be new or controversial to anyone with a slightly left-leaning bent or a passing interest in the state of the world. There is, however, an open acknowledgment of the privileges that allow for two white, middle-aged men to stage a subsidised chat for a paying audience. And there is an understanding that an equal future for which they advocate will rightly necessitate that the stage be ceded to others.\nHowever, while Commonism might sedately look towards the horizon, in the interplay between its minimal theatricality and a sincere commitment to actual shared presence and collective potential, it also guilefully interrogates its limitations, politically and performatively.\nSmith and Sveen\u2019s conversation culminates in the distribution of a handbook that contains the principles of commonism. Shifting from staged conversation to proclamation, copies are distributed to the audience. Read after the performance, unencumbered by even the most minimal theatrical trappings, one is struck by the text\u2019s difference in register and how these ideas might now function beyond the stage. It is not a step-by-step guide, but having negated their own theatricality, these ideas, even abstractly, feel concrete and of the world. They sincerely invite us to do with them as they will.\nThe manifesto features a quote from Sara Ahmed\u2019s Living a Feminist Life, reminding us that \u201cwe\u201d is \u201cnot a foundation but what we are working toward\u201d. As always: the great work begins.\nAt Birmingham Rep until 11 January.",

Markets up amid hopes of a US-China trade ceasefire\nGood morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories.\nDespite his recent threats, Donald Trump did not use his first live Oval Office address to declare a national emergency over immigration, nor did he offer any further solution to the ongoing government shutdown. Instead, the president filled the broadcast with familiar and dubious claims about border security and illegal immigration in an attempt to drum up public support for his coveted border wall.

The accusations emerged in a court filing that Manafort\u2019s lawyers apparently failed to properly redact before it was made public on Tuesday.

        "content": "Prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta appeal for new information after allegations of abuse are made in documentary about R&B star, who has long denied wrongdoing\nFresh investigations have been launched into allegations of sexual and physical abuse against R Kelly by prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta, after the airing of Surviving R Kelly, a documentary that contained claims of abuse by the R&B singer.\nChicago prosecutor Kimberly Foxx urged any potential victims of Kelly to come forward, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses. We cannot seek justice without you.\u201d Atlanta lawyer Gerald Griggs, representing a couple who claim Kelly is holding their daughter against her will, has said he was approached by the district attorney\u2019s office regarding potential abuse by Kelly.\nThe investigations will increase pressure on the embattled singer, who has long been dogged with accusations of sexual, physical and psychological abuse of women. Throughout 2017 and 2018, Kelly was accused of holding five women in a sex \u201ccult\u201d, with a former girlfriend alleging that he had sexual contact with girls as young as 14. In October, his ex-wife Andrea Kelly accused him of domestic violence. Earlier in his career, he was tried and acquitted on child pornography charges.\nKelly has long denied any wrongdoing, even recording a song professing his innocence, singing: \u201cI\u2019m so falsely accused.\u201d\nBy drawing together years of reporting into the R&B star, notably by journalist Jim DeRogatis, Surviving R Kelly has had an explosive impact in the US since it was broadcast last week. Calls to the US National Sexual Assault Hotline rose 20%, with Jodi Omear of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network acknowledging: \u201cHearing about sexual violence on the news or television shows can be difficult for survivors \u2026 We often see an increase in the number of people reaching out to the National Sexual Assault Hotline for help during high profile stories.\u201d\nWhile there has been support of Kelly from fans, and an increase in streams of his music since the documentary aired, many others have criticised the singer, including rapper 6lack who tweeted: \u201cGet this man tf outta here. please. he beyond trash.\u201d John Legend, one of the only stars to appear in the documentary, tweeted, referring to the disgraced Harvey Weinstein [who denies the allegations made against him]: \u201cSince his being exposed, his company and career have rightfully been destroyed and he\u2019s been indicted. Sounds like something that should happen to R Kelly.\u201d\nRapper, actor and activist Common told TMZ: \u201cWe failed as a community because we knew these things were happening and instead of trying to be like, \u2018Let\u2019s go and try to resolve this situation and free these young ladies and stop this thing that\u2019s going on,\u2019 we were just like, \u2018Man, we rocking to the music,\u2019\u201d adding: \u201cI\u2019m guilty of that too because I didn\u2019t stop and be like, \u2018Yo,\u2019 and speak against this.\u201d\nDamon Dash, the hip-hop mogul who was a partner to late R&B singer Aaliyah, whom Kelly himself allegedly illegally married when she was 15, has said: \u201cI had to look the other way, all these years,\u201d as his business partner Jay-Z recorded music with Kelly. In another interview he said the collaboration caused the partnership with Jay-Z to break down: \u201cI knew, morally, we weren\u2019t the same \u2026 to me, Roc-a-Fella was defunct. It was over. I couldn\u2019t fuck with it. It was something that, to me \u2013 I don\u2019t wanna say \u2018unforgivable,\u2019 but I couldn\u2019t understand it.\u201d He added that Aaliyah refused to discuss her relationship with Kelly.

        "content": "Cheap, simple and satisfying \u2013 Irish stew is the culinary equivalent of a big, woolly scarf\nWinter pleasures don\u2019t get much simpler than a steaming pot of Irish stew: cheap, easy and gloriously warming, they\u2019re the culinary equivalent of a big woolly scarf. Yet, with so many much-loved traditional dishes, the recipe itself is a bubbling cauldron of controversy: hardline purists maintain that it should contain nothing but meat, onions, potatoes and water, while others proffer treasured family recipes thickened with pearl barley, or sweetened with root vegetables.\nSadly, I can\u2019t remember my Dublin-born grandma ever making such a thing (possibly because my mum is the only Irish citizen ever to scorn the spud), so I can\u2019t offer my own version. On the bright side, this leaves me the freedom to be slightly more objective about what works and what doesn\u2019t. Having said that, on the downside, I\u2019ll probably have to go into hiding. Here goes \u2026\nThough you\u2019ll find many recipes online calling for beef, especially by American writers (lamb being so puzzling unpopular in the US that, as recently as 2011, more than half the population had never even tasted the stuff), Irish stew is made with sheep meat. On that point, even I won\u2019t budge. Strictly speaking, it ought to be mutton or even kid goat, because, as historian Regina Sexton points out in The Oxford Companion to Food, in days gone by, \u201cthe economic importance of sheep lay in their wool and milk produce, and thus ensured that only old or economically non-viable animals ended up in the cooking pot\u201d.\nBut few modern recipes use it. That\u2019s a shame, because slow cooking like this is the best way to appreciate a meat that, for all its flavour, can tend towards the tough: I try breast of mutton suggested by All in the Cooking, the official textbook of Dublin\u2019s famous Col\u00e1iste Mhuire Cookery School first published in 1946 and widely used in domestic science classes until the 1970s. We all thoroughly enjoy it, though it must be said that breast is a very fatty cut that makes for an incredibly rich gravy.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Darina Allen\u2019s recipe in the Ballymaloe Cookery Course book, named after the famous East Cork cookery school she founded in 1981, is prefaced with the advice that it\u2019s best made in early summer, \u201cwith young lamb\u201d, cut into chops not less than an inch thick. Making this in winter, I can\u2019t speak for spring lamb, except to say that I think the chops would probably be less fatty than the ones I use. But, delicious as the results are, it seems a shame to waste such tender meat on a stew.\nThe same goes for Diana Henry\u2019s lamb shanks: they\u2019re incredibly good, but about twice the price of the lamb neck preferred by Irish television legend Monica Sheridan, \u201cMammy of Irish cookery\u201d Maura Laverty and chef Richard Corrigan. Laverty calls for best end, and Corrigan for middle neck, both of which are rather meatier than the scrag end Allen reckons would have been traditional in old-style \u201cIrish cabins\u201d, which, of course, makes excellent stock.\nThe important thing is to ensure you have enough meat to go round (though this isn\u2019t a particularly meat-heavy dish) and enough bones to give flavour, so I\u2019d suggest getting hold of a lamb neck and asking for it to be cut into chops, so you get the whole lot.\nIf you don\u2019t happen to have a butcher handy, and don\u2019t have the time to order online, go for cubed lamb, as recommended by Mena Rogers, a friend\u2019s mum from Co Roscommon, who was taught by her own mother, Anne Gilhooly, who wowed everyone with her cooking just before the war. Clodagh McKenna similarly recommends stewing lamb, which generally comes from the neck, shoulder, breast or even shank, though using boneless meat will mean you need to find some decent stock.\nAs food writer Niamh Shields puts it: \u201cIrish stew without potatoes is not Irish stew \u2013 this is non-negotiable.\u201d What sort of potatoes, however, is somewhat less straightforward. Most older recipes just call for potatoes without further detail, but more modern versions are usually more discriminating, with Allen, Henry and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall calling for floury or even \u201cvery floury\u201d varieties.\nThe distinction is important, because, in England at least, we don\u2019t really do floury in the same way as they do across the water: here, the most widely available floury potatoes are roosters (22% \u201cdry matter\u201d \u2013 for that is the enticing way the consistency of potatoes is measured), followed by maris pipers (21.8%), desirees (20.8%) and king edwards (20.5%). This, of course, varies widely by size and season, but none of them can touch the imported golden wonders I find at an Irish butcher up the road, also, apparently, known as \u201cgreat balls of flour\u201d. These, Allen\u2019s kerr\u2019s pink and Shields\u2019 queen\u2019s potatoes are far fluffier than any of the above, so if you can find them, go for them, because the flourier the potato, the better it will be at thickening the stew. As Henry observes, the potatoes should be simmered long enough to break down into the liquid \u2013 indeed, if you slice them as thinly as All in the Cooking recommends, they\u2019ll break down almost completely into a thick, gluey sauce, rich with fat: utterly delicious, but almost more mash than stew.\nOne solution is to add them in stages. Deidre tweets me from Cork: \u201cA few potatoes should be chopped so they fall asunder in the stew and act as a natural thickening agent. The others are added for the last 15-20 minutes or so.\u201d Corrigan even uses two types of spud: one floury to melt into the stew, one waxy to stay intact. Personally, I prefer the fluffiness of the floury kind for gravy-soaking purposes, so I\u2019m going to start the stew with a layer of sliced potatoes and add some whole ones for the final half-hour, though if you\u2019re not a floury potato fan, you may wish to go down his route instead.\nOnions are the only other must-have. All in the Cooking\u2019s Irish stew, which generations of young cooks would have started with, contains only four ingredients \u2013 meat, potatoes, onions and water, plus a parsley garnish \u2013 and Sheridan\u2019s is the same, though with thyme instead of the parsley. They\u2019re surprisingly good for something so very plain: it turns out that, for all of our fancy tastes, meat and tatties can still make us happy on a cold, grey day.\nCarrots are the most popular extra, though I find little evidence that these are more of a southern thing, as David Tanis claims in the New York Times. Sheridan allows that they may be served on the side, but insists that \u201cit is quite wrong to cook carrots with this stew, as the long cooking will leave them insipid\u201d. Testers enjoy their sweetness, but I\u2019m inclined to agree that they do become mushy in the time it takes to cook the meat properly, so, like Henry, I\u2019m going to add them at a later stage.\nCelery is next up, used by Rogers and Laverty. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t much care for celery in any form, so I don\u2019t feel bad about leaving that out. I do very much like the cornucopia of other veg in Rogers\u2019 stew, though: turnip (which here, apparently, means the orange thing I\u2019d call a swede), leek and a little bit of cabbage, \u201cjust for colour\u201d, all in a delicious, meaty broth. It really is a complete meal in a bowl, though far be it from me to urge you into such heresies. (Try it though, it\u2019s lovely.)\nAllen suggests using tiny baby carrots and onions in her spring recipe, which is a nice idea if you want this dish to look a little more elegant (in which case you might want to use little salad potatoes as well).\nHerbs and spices tend, unsurprisingly, to be kept fairly simple: bay, parsley and thyme are popular, with chives and parsley the most common toppings. Gary Rhodes and Rachel Allen both add garlic, but this seems to me a dangerously fancy road to go down. If onions are good enough for the domestic science syllabus, they\u2019re good enough for me.\nThe same goes for wine or stout: some modern recipes moisten the stew with stock, but this should be necessary only if you\u2019re using boneless stewing meat: good-quality lamb stock is hard to get here, so I use chicken instead in the Ballymaloe recipe, and it works out very well. If not, then let\u2019s be honest, a cube isn\u2019t going to bring the sky down on your head.\nEven better, however, is to make a stock from the stew meat itself. Corrigan takes it off the bone and uses the bones to make a stock, while Henry slow-cooks shanks in water and aromatics until tender, then strains the resulting broth to cook the vegetables in. Both excellent recipes, but if you\u2019ve managed to get hold of lamb neck on the bone, it\u2019s easier to cook as is and pull off the meat off the bone before serving (or let people do it themselves on their plates): the gravy will still be rich and full-flavoured, and it\u2019s far less faff.\nThat said, all beasts are different, and if you taste the gravy and decide it\u2019s still underpowered, Rogers\u2019 dash of Worcestershire sauce, or indeed the Oxo cube apparently favoured by many Irish grannies, are your rescue remedies. And if you\u2019re feeling really daring, then chef Michael Clifford of the legendary Clonmel restaurant Clifford\u2019s used to add a good glug of double cream to his stew, while Lindsey Bareham recommends a knob of butter. Just don\u2019t say I told you to do it.\nTraditionally, it seems, the ingredients would have been put in the pot raw, as Laverty, Theodora FitzGibbon and All in the Cooking\u2019s recipes dictate, but more recent versions, such as the Ballymaloe one, brown the meat and veg first, with Allen and Shields both rendering fat from the meat for the purpose. Neck doesn\u2019t tend to come with great lumps of fat, but I do think it\u2019s worth softening the onions if you have time; raw onion is a remarkably persistent flavour, even after two hours in the oven, so it\u2019s 15 minutes well spent. The rest, however, can go in raw: this is a dish of soothingly mild flavours, patiently extracted over a low heat; traditionally over the fire, of course. But, as with any slow-cooked dishes, it\u2019s easier to keep the temperature constant in a medium oven \u2013 and as Allen so perspicaciously observes, \u201ca stew boiled is a stew spoiled\u201d.\nOne thing that is worth spending time on, however, is skimming the fat from the gravy, as Allen also recommends (though you don\u2019t need to thicken the gravy with a roux afterwards, unless your potatoes have failed in their thickening duties). As Rogers and Shields point out, Irish stew tastes even better the next day, so the easiest way to degrease is to drain the stew, then chill it and the liquid separately, so the fat solidifies on top of the gravy.\nPrep 20 min\n Cook 2 hr\n Serves 6\n2 tbsp oil or lamb fat3 large onions, peeled and thickly sliced10-12 medium very floury potatoes, depending on size and hunger, golden wonder or kerr\u2019s pink are ideal, if you can get them; otherwise rooster, desiree or maris piper1 neck of lamb, hogget or mutton, cut into thick slices2 sprigs fresh thyme6 carrots (optional; substitute some of these for chopped turnip, swede or leek, if you like)Chopped parsley or chives, to serve\nHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Heat the oil in a large casserole dish over a medium flame and sweat the onions until soft and golden, but not browned. Meanwhile, peel four of the potatoes and slice thinly.\nTake the pot off the heat, tip the onions into a bowl and line the base of the pan with sliced potato. Tip the onion back into the pot, along with the meat and thyme, season generously and pour in 850ml cold water. Bring to a bare simmer, then cover and transfer the casserole to the oven for an hour and a half.\nShortly before the end of this time, peel the carrots and remaining potatoes, and cut into large chunks. Stir the carrots into the pot and put the potatoes on top. Leaving the lid slightly ajar, cook for another 30 minutes, by which time the meat should be very tender and the sliced potatoes all but disintegrated into the gravy.\nStrain the gravy and, if eating immediately, spoon off and discard the grease from the top before adding back to the casserole and reheating. If not, chill the gravy, then lift off the solidified fat before pouring back into the dish and reheating; you can strip the meat from the bone at this point, if you like.\nTaste, season if necessary and top with chopped parsley or chives. Serve with pickled red cabbage or steamed greens.\n Irish stew: dare I ask, what\u2019s your family recipe, and is it your favourite?

        "content": "Encouraging news for the embattled Wada president, Sir Craig Reedie, as the founder Wada president, Dick Pound, rides eye-catchingly to his defence. By way of recap, Russia last week missed the deadline to allow the World Anti\u2011Doping Agency access to the Moscow laboratory that was at the heart of its massive state-sponsored doping programme. This deadline was itself a bizarre act of faith on Wada\u2019s part, given that Russia has failed to comply with two crucial recommendations of the McLaren report which uncovered the vast scale of their cheating.\nAnyway, the predictably missed deadline has gone down like the proverbial sandwich with many national anti-doping authorities, as well as many clean athletes who increasingly despair of the notion that Wada is run in their interests, and not those of states to which Wada\u2019s main funder, the IOC, may wish to cosy up.\nBut they\u2019re all wrong, apparently. Dick has penned an article in which he explains that the reaction \u201chas all the elements of a lynch mob\u201d. Does it? I hesitate to resort to a Family Fortunes analogy, given the subject matter. But if you asked a hundred people what \u201call the elements of a lynch mob\u201d were, and we pictured Vernon Kay waiting for the percentages to pop up on the big screen, I imagine our survey would have said something quite different. \u201cForty-nine people said \u2018racists\u2019,\u201d Vernon might reveal. \u201cForty-one said \u2018noose\u2019 \u2026. Seven said Deep South \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019ve got nothing for \u2018despairing anti-doping executives\u2019 or \u2018some newspaper articles\u2019. Athletes, you have a chance to steal.\u201d\nLeaving aside the question of whether it is remotely appropriate to cast an equivalence between robust criticism and actual lynching, Dick\u2019s suggestion that the criticism is driven by ignorance of due process simply doesn\u2019t stand up. Not only did Wada row back on its own terms for Russian readmission, but Reedie\u2019s own predecessor in the president\u2019s chair, David Howman, accused the agency of bowing to pressure. \u201cThis looks like they have taken the decision to deviate from a carefully put-together roadmap for entirely pragmatic reasons,\u201d he judged. \u201cWada has gone from being an organisation that cared about clean athletes to one that cares about international federations that have not been able to stage events in Russia: it\u2019s money over principle.\u201d\nReading Pound\u2019s defence of Reedie\u2019s stewardship, it is hard not to see Wada as just another club of the same sort of men who stick together. Of more immediate concern is its apparent faith that the Russian authorities are also chaps cut from similar cloth.\nIn Michael Cockerell\u2019s documentary about the great offices of state, a former foreign office official outlined something called \u201cthe Wykehamist fallacy\u201d. \u201cIntelligence failures very often come not because you can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening,\u201d he smiled wryly, \u201cbut because you misinterpret the intentions. You read their intentions as if they\u2019d been educated at Winchester, you know, and they haven\u2019t been \u2013 they\u2019re a bunch of thugs. And actually their intentions aren\u2019t our sort of intentions, and they may not be bluffing \u2013 they may be out to do something catastrophically dangerous.\u201d\nI can\u2019t help feeling there is rather a lot of this naivety to Reedie (and now to his defender, Pound). Back last year when he was justifying the decision to chuck the Russians a bone, Reedie described the notion that Russia might miss the deadline as \u201cinconceivable\u201d. He must now conceive of such a thing, but the damage caused to his organisation \u2013 and, by more important extension, to the believability of sport \u2013 has been serious. If Wada continues to misidentify its enemies, it may become critical.\nAnd so to news that Wayne Rooney was arrested and fined last month at a Washington airport, after being accused of intoxication in a public place and swearing at police. According to his spokesman, Rooney was \u201cdisorientated\u201d after taking \u201ca prescribed amount of sleeping tablets mixed with some alcohol consumption\u201d. He was on a private flight back from a one-day promotional trip to Saudi Arabia.\nThe feelings of DC airport cops notwithstanding, some will find the Saudi Arabia element of the tale the most distasteful, for all the good it might have done Rooney\u2019s business. Saudi Arabia is a country where women have historically not even been allowed into football stadiums. That all changed this time last year, you may recall, as part of a much-praised drive by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to \u201creform\u201d his country, which was all going so well until his operatives murdered and dismembered a prominent journalist inside an embassy. Still, you will note that MBS has shaken off the haters in a very \u201cyou do you\u201d way, and is continuing to bomb and starve Yemenis into the world\u2019s deepest humanitarian catastrophe with the various weapons we continue to sell his family.\nSorry, where were we? Ah yes. Football. Of course.\nWith regards to Rooney, there is something very \u201cfootball now\u201d about getting wasted on top of your Ambien as you are private jetted from 18 hours\u2019 sportswashing duty in arguably the ghastliest country in the world, back to Washington DC where you are seeing out your playing days far from home, and without even the sunshine lifestyle benefits so often touted as the perks of an LA Galaxy contract.\nI\u2019m not saying Rooney has suffered enough for this latest misdemeanour, or even that he was aware of why a trip to Saudi should be right down his to-do list. But none of this is really the football you dream of when you\u2019re a kid, is it, and all the money in the world can\u2019t self-medicate that.",

She has received a nine-month suspended sentence and fined \u00a35,000.\nEdis said Little falsified documents then presented them to Mackinlay and his election agent Nathan Gray for signing, which \u201cthey did so in good faith not knowing what she had done\u201d.\nThe judge said she was \u201ccarried away by her conviction\u201d that defeating Farage was an \u201coverwhelmingly important political objective\u201d.\nElection campaigners and Farage criticised the fine and suspended sentence, saying it would encourage bigger parties to continue to break election laws.\nThe prosecution had alleged that Mackinlay, Little and Gray had knowingly filed \u201cwoefully inaccurate\u201d expenditure returns that included a forged signature as they faced the rising challenge of Ukip in South Thanet.\nDeclared spending on the campaign came in under the strict \u00a352,000 limit, but prosecutors alleged up to \u00a366,600 more was spent on staffing, accommodation, advertising, posters and a bus for Mackinlay\u2019s campaign which was not declared.\nMackinlay, 52, a chartered accountant, faced two charges of making a false election expenses declaration during the campaign, which ended with him winning by a majority of almost 3,000.\nLittle, 63, who had been employed by Conservative campaign headquarters since 1974, was charged with three counts of encouraging or assisting an offence related to the filing of election expenses. Gray, 29, was accused of two offences of making a false declaration.\nLittle in effect took over the campaign in March 2014, several weeks before the election, and was joined by other Tory activists who stayed in hotel accommodation, the prosecution alleged. This generated thousands of pounds in election expenses that had not been declared in official returns, it was claimed.\nThe activists included Nick Timothy, who was a close aide to the then home secretary, Theresa May, and subsequently became Downing Street\u2019s chief of staff, the court heard.\nAfter the Conservative victory by 2,800 votes, Gray emailed Little congratulating her on a \u201ctruly magnificent election campaign\u201d, the court heard.\nFarage told the Guardian that the verdict would reinforce the impression that the political system was skewed towards larger and richer political parties.\n\u201cPoor electoral law combined with an ineffective electoral commission mean that the \u2018big party politics\u2019 cartel can carry on acting with impunity,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt makes the disconnect between voters and their leaders even wider.\u201d\nThe director of Unlock Democracy, Alexandra Runswick, said Little\u2019s sentence would cause political parties to \u201ccrack open the champagne\u201d.\n\u201cIf the penalty for committing electoral fraud is walking away with a non-custodial sentence and a \u00a35,000 fine that\u2019s an advertisement to break the law, not a disincentive,\u201d she said.\nIn last year\u2019s general election, a week after it was announced that he would be prosecuted, Mackinlay held South Thanet with an increased majority of 6,387.\nGray was cleared in December after he was found not guilty of one charge of making a false election expenses declaration.\nIn a statement, Mackinlay described the prosecution as \u201cnearly three years of pure hell\u201d and said he had \u201cextreme concerns\u201d about the clarity of election law.\n\u201cI await a statement from the Electoral Commission, the CPS and Kent police as to how they justify millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money in pursuing me in a political show trial,\u201d he said.\nA Conservative party spokesman welcome the Mackinlay and Gray verdicts but expressed disappointment at Little\u2019s conviction.\n\u201cGiven recent court interpretations, there is clearly a need for greater clarity and guidance on the law. We will take further legal advice and continue to meet with the Electoral Commission to seek this,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Unsafe in Somalia and unwanted in Kenya, refugees increasingly risk abduction in search of a better life \nTwo months after he went missing from the Dadaab refugee complex, Abdullahi Mohamed called his mother, Ubah, from a detention centre in Libya where he was being been held by armed gangs. The men asked his mother to pay a ransom of up to $10,000 (\u00a37,850) for the 19-year-old.\nRelieved but distraught, Ubah started fundraising for his release, talking to family members in the diaspora and in Somalia.\n\u201cI managed to get some money but it is far less than they demand,\u201d she says. \u201cI will continue to contact relatives so that we can secure his release as soon as possible.\u201d\nAbdullahi was in his second year of secondary school when he went missing. He spent most of his time in the camp playing football.\n\u201cHe loves football and dreams of playing in the English Premier League,\u201d Ubah says. \u201cHe used to tell me that he would become a celebrity one day and that I would be overwhelmed by journalists looking for his whereabouts.\u201d\nAbdullahi is among a handful of young men who left Dadaab last year and were smuggled to Libya through Sudan, according to camp leaders.\nAbdullahi told his mother he had left with a group of young Somalis from the camps, some of whom are yet to be connected with their families.\nRefugees in Dadaab say the travel ban imposed by Donald Trump, which affected refugee resettlement programmes, has had a devastating impact on the hopes of young people in the camps. Many had been waiting for years only to be told they cannot travel.\nAhmed Dhake is among several hundred refugees in Kenya who were stopped from travelling to the US in 2017. The thought of illegal migration occurred to him, but family ties held him back. \u201cI could not leave my elderly mother behind,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not surprised to see people using the illegal route to escape Dadaab, because the legal pathways are not working.\u201d\nThe uncertainty surrounding the future of the camp, the closure of which was announced by the Kenyan authorities in May 2016, and the lack of prospects in Somalia make it easier for smugglers and traffickers to exploit them.\n\u201cIt is a worrying trend that young people from Dadaab are giving themselves up to smugglers,\u201d, says Abdullahi Osman, one of the camp leaders. \u201cThey have no other way out; Somalia is not yet safe and Kenya does not want us, so it is not easy to convince them to stay.\u201d\nIt is a desperate, dangerous journey for refugees, but a lucrative business for people smugglers. The journey, popularly known as tahriib in Somali, is common in the Horn of Africa.\nSmugglers recently started operating a new form of tahriib, a \u201cleave-now-pay-later\u201d scheme that enables young refugees to travel without their parents\u2019 knowledge or consent.\nA network of people finance the journey, with different groups assuming responsibility for the refugees along the route to Libya. What starts as a mutual agreement often ends in captivity.\nUbah says she was asked to give varying amounts of money to different people in Nairobi and Mogadishu. She believes these people covered her son\u2019s travel costs.\n\u201cMy son was a student, he had no means of income, they paid for his expenses and sold him out to thugs in Libya,\u201d she says.\nLast August, another mother, Nadifo Abdi, from Ifo camp, whose son is being held with Abdullahi, used social media to plead for help to raise $9,000 for his release. Crying in a Facebook video, posted by a local journalist, she described how she hoped her 20-year-old son would finish school and give back to the family.\n\u201cHe told me he is being tortured and starved. They punish him because we delayed paying the money they asked for,\u201d she says.\nNadifo\u2019s son was also a student, among the 10,000 children currently enrolled in the camps\u2019 seven secondary schools. But the Kenyan government does not allow refugees to work and so there is little hope of getting employment or going to university. Globally, only 1% of young refugees attend university.\nMore than 250,000 people now regard Dadaab, in north-east Kenya, as their home. The vast majority are from Somalia.\nSince 2014, about 80,000 have returned to Somalia through a voluntary repatriation programme, sponsored by the UN refugee agency. The security situation in Somalia remains dire, with deadly attacks taking place in the capital almost every week. In early November, multiple bomb blasts killed 52 people and injured more than 100 others.\nShrinking humanitarian funding means many aid agencies have either left Dadaab or scaled down their services. The need for food remains pressing, yet even the basic rations upon which refugees depend have been reduced by up to 30%.\nThe few who manage to escape the camps and reach Europe are stuck in limbo, waiting for a chance to cross to travel on elsewhere.\nAbdi Mohamed, 30, left the camps about three years ago. \u201cI was detained in Libya for almost 18 months but finally I made it to Rome, where I am currently living in limbo,\u201d he says. \u201cI sleep rough and depend on little meals from charities. I never thought life would be so difficult in Europe, but I will not give up until I reach the UK or Norway, or anywhere better than Italy. There is no going back.\u201d\nThe EU is supporting Libyan coastguards to stop migrants from crossing the sea. Those intercepted are returned to overcrowded detention centres in Libya, where they face torture, extortion and abuse.\nNo one knows exactly how many refugees from Dadaab are currently being held in Libya or have died trying to reach Europe.",

        "content": "Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, who has died aged 91, is famous among mathematicians as one author of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in number theory. Published in 1965, this was immediately influential, becoming even more prominent in 1999 as one of the Clay Mathematics Institute\u2019s seven $1m Millennium Prize Problems, alongside the Riemann hypothesis.\nSwinnerton-Dyer\u2019s first published paper appeared in 1943, when he was 16 and still at school. His most recent publications, which are substantial, date from 2012-16, and he was pursuing major new research directions well into his final year. In between he served as master of St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, before moving to the civil service as chair of the University Grants Committee (UGC).\nThe B-SD conjecture was made on the basis of computer calculations, the first serious application of computers in pure mathematical research. However, the computing facilities available at the time were rudimentary; to the point that Swinnerton-Dyer himself wrote the first operating system for Titan, the successor at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory to the EDSAC2 on which he carried out the computations with Bryan Birch. He later described himself on occasions as a computer scientist masquerading as a pure mathematician.\nThe B-SD conjecture states that, given a cubic equation in two variables with integer coefficients, the number of rational solutions is governed in a precise way by the L-function of the elliptic curve it defines. (L-functions of elliptic curves also play a central role in Andrew Wiles\u2019s proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.) While the B-SD conjecture is a key problem in modern mathematics, and much is known about it, a complete proof remains elusive.\nIn view of modern applications of number theory to cryptography and internet security, workable solutions to problems around B-SD might be worth a great deal more than a million dollars to well-informed cybercriminals or their opponents.\nSwinnerton-Dyer was born at Ponteland, Northumberland, the son of Sir Leonard Swinnerton-Dyer and his wife, Barbara (nee Brackenbury). The family moved to Shropshire early in Peter\u2019s childhood. His father, as well as being a baronet and member of the landed gentry, was an engineer and successful businessman, and chair of several companies. He was also a well-known figure in British chess circles, but Peter was the first in his family to go to university. He read a lot and enjoyed doing sums; his mother supported his academic ambitions and his local school teacher recognised his mathematical aptitude.\nHe won a scholarship to Eton and in 1945 went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a graduate student he studied under JE Littlewood, but never completed a PhD. However, in 1950 he became a fellow of Trinity, and remained there until 1973, with a crucial year\u2019s visit to Chicago in the 1950s, where he worked with Andr\u00e9 Weil, an influence that set him on course to the famous conjecture and to much else besides.\nSwinnerton-Dyer\u2019s role at Trinity included a spell as dean, responsible for discipline. His sympathy with students and liking for their company (especially with cider, or evening board games) made him a less than feared figure (the family motto is Terrere nolo timere nescio, roughly \u201cUnthreatening; undaunted\u201d). In 1973, at the relatively young age of 46, he was elected master of St Catharine\u2019s. He remained there for 10 years, frequently preferring student company to that of the fellows. During this time the character of the college was enriched by the admission of women.\nThe year 1983 brought abrupt change: he resigned from St Catharine\u2019s, took up the UGC chair, and married the archaeologist Harriet Crawford. This was a turbulent time in university finances: Swinnerton-Dyer worked closely with the education secretary Sir Keith Joseph.\nThough himself an SDP member, he respected both Margaret Thatcher and Joseph and was influential in informing them of the importance of research quality in judging universities. While by no means perfect, the research assessment system then introduced contributed to the competitiveness of UK universities in the world. He left the Universities Funding Council (successor to the UGC) in 1991.\nSwinnerton-Dyer was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1967, succeeded his father as 16th baronet in 1975 and was knighted in 1987. He won the Sylvester medal of the Royal Society and the 2006 P\u00f3lya prize of the London Mathematical Society, and was awarded honorary degrees at Bath and Warwick universities.\nEven as head of the UGC-UFC, he had never ceased to do mathematics, and published several major papers during the 80s. His mathematical work was remarkable for its originality, freely mixing ideas from different areas to attain unexpected insights. He was fearless in his choice of problems. From the 90s, he pursued work on 2-descent (a method going back to Fermat) as a way to study rational points on varieties fibred in elliptic curves; the aim being practical calculations to determine for interesting classes of algebraic surfaces (and so on) whether rational points exist, and if so, how many.\nThis sometimes involved highbrow modern theory, but not as a first preference. The quest for a beautiful theory never ruled out cobbling together a messy or convoluted solution that actually worked. Despite the seemingly modest viewpoint, Swinnerton-Dyer obtained very significant results, several in areas previously considered intractable. One of his papers was conceived while on a tour of eastern Anatolia with Harriet: latterly he often accompanied her to archaeological meetings.\nStories about Swinnerton-Dyer abound. In addition to his love of student company and board games, he was more than competent at squash, tennis and real tennis. He played chess well and bridge to international standard: he was part of the British team that came second in the 1953 European championship.\nIn a tournament, Swinnerton-Dyer once scuttled his opponents\u2019 grand slam by bidding eight clubs; the rules at the time invalidated an impossible bid made by mistake or oversight, so he first informed the tournament director that his bid was intentional. The rules of bridge were subsequently revised to prevent this.\nSwinnerton-Dyer was an inspirational if idiosyncratic teacher. His genial personality, exceptional erudition and generous support for students and younger colleagues won him many lasting friends.\nHis wife survives him.\n Henry Peter Francis Swinnerton-Dyer, mathematician, university administrator and civil servant, born 2 August 1927; died 26 December 2018\n This article was amended on 11 January 2019, to correct Peter Swinnerton-Dyer\u2019s father\u2019s name to Leonard.",

Her widow, Monica Benicio, has continued her fight for better treatment of the poor, the LGBT community and black Brazilians.\nThe murder has still not been solved and in our documentary Marielle and Monica, as the police investigation drifts, Monica is plunged into a new crisis: the probable election of Jair Bolsonaro. Watch the full documentary here.\nOn the eve of his inauguration, the film documents Monica\u2019s involvement in the campaign opposing the far-right president; glimmers of hope in the election of some politicians from other parties; and the aftermath of the vote, which suggests a terrifying future for LGBT rights in Brazil and for politicians who oppose the government, with little hope of Marielle\u2019s murder being adequately solved.\nCongratulations to the team behind the Guardian documentary Black Sheep, which has been shortlisted in the documentary short subject category at the Oscars. The final five nominations will be announced on 22 January.\nA group of women from Leeds with experience of poverty come together to make a film about their experiences. Collectively researching and producing the film, they illustrate the shame felt by people through eight individual household objects: a cooker, a kettle, a bed, a school uniform, a present, a bus ticket, a coffin and a tampon. In this quiet and beautiful film, the women tell their own stories of poverty and shame and say they want their voices to be heard, and for people in power to listen.

But the police who attended the scene failed to examine his body or launch a proper investigation, his inquest has found.\nConcluding a three-day inquest in Sandwich, Kent, assistant coroner Christopher Sutton-Mattocks said: \u201cMax was a conspiracy theorist and a well-known one at that.\n\u201cIf there was anything that was bound to excite the interest of other conspiracy theorists, it was the wholly incompetent initial investigation into his death.\u201d\nIn the days before he died, Spiers had told his mother, Vanessa Bates, he feared he might be murdered, and had sent her a text message asking her to \u201cinvestigate\u201d if anything happened to him, the inquest has previously been told.\nSpiers, also known as Bates-Spiers, fell asleep on the sofa of his friend Monika Duval after taking several tablets of a Turkish form of the drug Xanax, then stopped breathing, the inquest heard.\nHe vomited \u201cgastric fluids\u201d as she attempted resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. A postmortem examination also found deadly levels of oxycodone, an opioid, in his system.\nTwo police officers who visited Duval\u2019s house said they made \u201cno examination or further investigation\u201d after a doctor said the death was due to natural causes, the coroner heard.\nGiving a narrative conclusion, Sutton-Mattocks said the cause of death was pneumonia and intoxication by drugs, which caused aspiration of gastric contents.\nThe 39-year-old was a journalist \u201cdealing with the topics of conspiracy theories and paranormal phenomena\u201d, the inquest previously heard. \u201cHe was very funny, so funny and so full of life, and humorous,\u201d his mother said.\n\u201cHe was not one of those dead hellbent on conspiracy and pointing out that the government was going to fall \u2013 stereotypically, that\u2019s how conspiracy theorists are presented.\u201d\nSpiers was in Warsaw to attend the Earth Project conference, where he gave a lecture about participation in \u201csecret military programmes\u201d, the inquest heard.\nHe met Duval, a publisher, at the event and she let him stay at her house for several weeks before his death on 16 July 2016.\nIn a statement read to the inquest, Duval said that \u201cgastric fluids\u201d had poured from Spiers\u2019 mouth as she tried resuscitation. Emergency services who arrived shortly after pronounced him dead at the scene.\nThe hearing was told paramedics called two police officers, Slawomir Mamczak and Pawel Semeniuk, after Duval grew agitated when they stopped CPR.\nIn a statement, Mamczak said a doctor told them the death was \u201cdue to natural causes\u201d. He added: \u201cThe doctor said a woman who was present in the house didn\u2019t agree with their decision to stop resuscitation.\u201d\nSemeniuk said in a statement: \u201cAfter the doctor said the death was due to natural causes, we somehow didn\u2019t delve into it \u2026 There was no examination or further investigation.\u201d",

It is billed as an effervescent tablet that can transform a glass of champagne, cava or prosecco into a full-blown fruity cocktail, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking that combining FIZZ with fizz suggested imminent disaster. Wouldn\u2019t the tablets \u2013 essentially a booze-friendly Berocca but with none of the boring old vitamins \u2013 make your glass of fizz foam up over the glass and all over your living-room floor, embarrassing you in front of all your glamorous party guests?\nReasoning that this would be a hideous design flaw and therefore surely not likely, I dropped my first FIZZ tablet into a flute of prosecco and watched as the fizz foamed up over my glass and all over my living-room floor, embarrassing me in front of all my \u2026 well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s fortunate that I have no glamorous friends.\nUnfortunately, FIZZ only got worse from here. The tablets come in three flavours \u2013 elderflower, rhubarb and tropical passion fruit. I sampled the latter, and it tasted \u2026 how can we put this? \u2026 less than great. Bitter, artificial and with the undeniable \u201cvibe\u201d of a men\u2019s urinals, the majority of the glass went down the sink. Judging by the taste of it, it might just have helped with unblocking it, too. To do this to a glass of even the cheapest fizz is an act of liquid vandalism, heaven forbid anyone who considers dropping one into a glass of Pol Roger Brut R\u00e9serve.\nItems such as FIZZ are tempting because they tap into our desire for quick fixes and \u201chacks\u201d, when sometimes skill, experience and the ability to throw an aluminium shaker over your head while flashing a white-toothed smile should be valued instead. Making a good cocktail, like making most food and drink, requires love, not a tablet. Besides, a drop of Chambord or fruit juice are far more effective ways to jazz up a glass of bubbly.\nAdmittedly, FIZZ was slightly more pleasant when dropped in a glass of tonic water \u2013 although mild urine notes persisted. And when dissolved in half a pint of water it was almost verging on the drinkable. But it will not improve your champagne.\nInstead, it makes it look like a science experiment and taste like the inside of your mouth during the low point of a nasty illness. FIZZ fails on all tests \u2013 unless, that is, you are struggling with Dry January, in which case, it might just provide the perfect solution.",

According to Yahoo Sports, the chances of Reid being chosen six times in 11 weeks for random tests is 0.17%. Ten of the 72 eligible players on the Panthers roster are selected by computer for tests each week.\nOn Wednesday, the NFL and NFLPA denied any malfeasance. \u201cWe asked the independent administrator of the policy to review and produce a report on the claims of targeting,\u201d read a joint statement from the two bodies. \u201cWe will not breach any player\u2019s confidentiality, but can confirm that the report documents the dates he was randomly selected for testing and the actual dates of the drug tests.\n\u201cThe report also demonstrates that Mr Reid\u2019s tests were randomly generated via computer algorithm and that his selection for testing was normal when compared with the number of tests players were randomly selected for throughout the league during the time that he was on an active roster. There is no evidence of targeting or any other impropriety with respect to his selection for testing.\u201d\nIn May, Reid filed a collusion grievance against the NFL alleging he had been kept out of the league due to his political stance. Reid\u2019s deal with the San Francisco 49ers expired in March, and on playing ability alone he would have been expected to find a new team quickly: in 2013 he was named to the Pro Bowl as a rookie after being drafted in the first round and has had a solid career since. However, he was not picked up until he signed for the Panthers in September, after the season had started.\nReid believed that, like Kaepernick, he was unemployed due to his political views. \u201cThe notion that I can be a great signing for your team for cheap, not because of my skill set but because I\u2019ve protested systemic oppression, is ludicrous. If you think [it] is, then your mindset is part of the problem too,\u201d Reid wrote on Twitter earlier this year.",

Many of them waved and cheered at cameras recording their arrival.\n\u201cThe crisis wasn\u2019t created by us. We\u2019re not making a war against the NGOs, we\u2019re appealing to all to respect the rules,\u201d Muscat said after announcing the operation was to begin.\nSalvini, who travelled to Poland on Wednesday to meet leaders of the ruling Law and Justice party, suggested that the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, should not have negotiated the deal.\n\u201cI won\u2019t authorise migrant arrivals,\u201d he said during a press conference in Warsaw with Polish interior minister, Joachim Brudzi\u0144ski. He criticised the distribution plan, arguing that the EU was \u201csuccumbing to the blackmail of [people] smugglers and NGOs. This risks becoming a huge problem.\u201d\nMuscat said that the deal would also result in the eight countries taking in 249 other people brought to Malta by its military patrol boats in December.\nThirty-two of the stranded people are onboard Sea-Watch 3, which has been at sea for 19 days, while an additional 17 were rescued on 29 December by Sea-Eye. Rescuers have spoken about the turmoil among the rescued people as the standoff continued, with some jumping into the sea in an attempt to reach Malta.\nMalta allowed the two ships to shelter from bad weather near its coast and for them to be resupplied with fresh food and water, but until now had refused to let those onboard disembark, arguing that they had been rescued beyond the country\u2019s search-and-rescue zone.\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 people rescued in the Mediterranean have been denied entry into Italy in similar standoffs since Salvini, who leads the far-right League, started a clampdown on immigration within days of coming to power last June. Earlier this week he clashed with Conte and his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, who both said that women and their children should be taken off the boats and brought to Italy.",

        "content": "President offers no new solutions to government shutdown in first Oval Office address of his presidency\nDonald Trump has used the first Oval Office address of his presidency to stoke fears of illegal immigration, repeat dubious claims about his border wall, and offer no new solutions to the partial government shutdown.\nIn the type of made-for-TV-moment he relishes, Trump blamed criminal gangs and \u201cvast quantities of illegal drugs\u201d for \u201cthousands of deaths\u201d and faulted Democrats for failing to end the shutdown, now in its 19th day.\nTop congressional Democrats accused him of fearmongering, and using rhetoric \u201cfull of misinformation and even malice\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a humanitarian crisis \u2013 a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,\u201d Trump told primetime viewers on Tuesday night, describing the situation at the border. He argued that the current immigration system allows \u201cvicious coyotes and ruthless gangs\u201d to prey on immigrants, especially women and children.\nThe Oval Office has typically been a projection of power used by presidents before him to address the nation at times of crisis or tragedy. In remarks lasting 10 minutes, Trump sought to make the case for a border wall \u2013 arguably the central promise of his short political career \u2013 and tried to imply the proposal had broad public support.\n\u201cLaw enforcement professionals have requested $5.7bn for a physical barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It\u2019s also what our professionals at the border want and need.\n\u201cThis is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500bn a year, vastly more than the $5.7bn we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\u201d\nFactcheckers have poured scorn on Trump\u2019s assertion that the trade deal, a successor to Nafta, means that Mexico is paying for the wall. The Mexican government has always refused to do so. And following the address, critics were quick to point out that Democrats are against money for a border wall \u2013 whether steel or concrete.\nNearly three weeks in to the shutdown, Trump did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress, as had been speculated. Instead he said: \u201cThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.\u201d\nCalling on Democrats to pass a spending bill, he added: \u201cThis situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\u201d\nOn an extraordinary night for US politics, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, delivered a live rebuttal from the House speaker\u2019s balcony hallway. Both adamantly oppose the construction of a wall and have urged Trump to reopen the government while talks continue.\n\u201cSadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cPresident Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.\u201d\nSchumer added: \u201cWe don\u2019t govern by temper-tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\n\u201cTonight \u2013 and throughout this debate and his presidency \u2013 President Trump has appealed to fear, not facts. Division, not unity.\u201d\nThe New York senator said: \u201cMost presidents have used Oval Office addresses for noble purposes. This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\u201d\nThe White House countered those points on Wednesday by accusing Democrats of being in denial.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fighting for the protection and the safety of every American citizen,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said. \u201cIf this is the face and the future of the Democrat party I think things are looking really good for Republicans.\u201d\nTrump has privately dismissed the address to the nation and his proposed visit to the border this week as pointless, according to the New York Times. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors on Tuesday, he reportedly said he was talked into both steps by advisers.\nIn the run-up to the address, the White House had been caught in a series of falsehoods. At the weekend, Sanders claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been apprehended at the southern border. On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, admitted that this was \u201can unfortunate misstatement\u201d as most of the individuals had been stopped at airports.\nMeanwhile, Pence was questioned by NBC News on Monday about Trump\u2019s claim that some former presidents told him a wall should be built (all four living presidents have denied it). The vice-president replied: \u201cI know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents.\u201d\nThe president, who has threatened to keep the government closed for months or even years, will attend a Senate Republican lunch meeting on Wednesday, then visit the southern border on Thursday as he continues to wage a public relations offensive. The partial government shutdown is now the second-longest in history, affects more than 800,000 workers, and there is no end in sight.\nOn Tuesday night, immigrants\u2019 right groups again condemned Trump\u2019s message. Lorella Praeli, the deputy political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \u201cWith tonight\u2019s speech, President Trump chose to compound the chaos because he can\u2019t convince the majority of Americans that their taxpayer dollars should fund his bogus campaign promise ... The president appears to be more focused on procuring his xenophobic symbol than running the government and upholding democratic norms.\u201d",

        "content": "Throughout the episodes of misfortune and grim ownership that have beset so many football clubs in recent times, it is difficult to recall a chairman being quite so damning of another as Forest Green Rovers\u2019 Dale Vince was of the Bolton owner, Ken Anderson, this week. However dismal or destructive a regime has been perceived by fans, there has tended to be some solidarity or sympathy, at least in public, even from more responsible owners. The Football League\u2019s new policy, that owners and directors should face sanctions for disreputable conduct, was adopted last summer after a quiet review of the rules, following outcries by supporters of several clubs.\nVince did not hold back about Anderson\u2019s failure to pay the wages of Christian Doidge, the Forest Green forward on loan at Bolton since August, saying Anderson had taken on the contract without the money to honour it and broken all his promises. Vince said Anderson effectively told him he could not force Bolton to pay, because even if Forest Green sued and put Bolton into insolvency, Anderson has security, a charge, for any loans he has put in, while Forest Green do not, so might receive only 10p in the pound.\nVince described Anderson publicly as \u201ca rogue chairman, a slippery character and untrustworthy\u201d. He told the Guardian that Anderson\u2019s attitude to running up debt was \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201ca sign of somebody who has been round the block on this kind of thing\u201d.\nWanderers had already fallen calamitously from their 2001-12 stretch in the Premier League, and were seriously facing liquidation after 142 years, when Anderson took over. The top-flight era under the late chairman Phil Gartside, mostly managed by Sam Allardyce, had increasingly been supported by the Isle of Man-based previous owner, Eddie Davies, who made his fortune marketing the heating element in kettles. Davies finally declared in November 2015 that he had to turn the tap off, having poured in an astonishing \u00a3180m, which, with unpaid interest, he agreed to write off.\nThe insolvency practitioner Trevor Birch could not find anyone prepared to take on the grand club, hobbled by ongoing losses, even for \u00a31. With Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs about to wind Wanderers up for unpaid tax, the former striker Dean Holdsworth finally did, in March 2016, backed by a \u00a34m high-interest loan. Anderson arrived late, initially as Holdsworth\u2019s 50-50 partner; now he has 95% ownership after buying the Bolton shares in September when Holdsworth\u2019s own company went bust.\nAnderson\u2019s backstory was not encouraging. In September 2005 he was disqualified from being a company director for eight years after his firm Professional Sports International Ltd, and seven other of his companies, went bust. The official Insolvency Service notice stated that Anderson had failed to ensure his companies paid VAT, then failed to cooperate with liquidators. At PSI, \u201cMr Anderson diverted/sought to divert PSI\u2019s funds by depositing them into a personal bank account in his own name and invoicing in the name of another connected company.\u201d\nThe notice stated that the Official Receiver had obtained an arrest warrant against Anderson when he failed to appear to be examined about one company\u2019s finances. \u201cHowever the Tipstaff [court officer] was unable to arrest Mr Anderson,\u201d it said.\nNow resident in Switzerland, Anderson was not barred by the EFL from being Bolton\u2019s owner or director because that disqualification order was concluded in October 2013. Already certain to be relegated when he took over, under Anderson\u2019s ownership Bolton won promotion back to the Championship immediately in 2017, and stayed up last season. He sold players, including Rob Holding, to Arsenal, and Zach Clough, to Nottingham Forest, in an effort to manage losses, but has struggled for the cashflow to ballast the club. The players went on strike briefly in the summer when their wages were not paid on time, suppliers have been left unpaid for long periods, and the EFL has imposed a transfer embargo.

The policy states that \u201cdirect action\u201d can be taken more broadly, for: \u201cA very serious single act or persistent serious acts \u2026 where the individual\u2019s conduct is clearly damaging to the standing and reputation of the wider profession and the game of football.\u201d\nVince told the Guardian he believes that is a \u201cfair description\u201d of Anderson\u2019s conduct, and the league should investigate. An EFL spokesman confirmed that the policy has been adopted, but it is understood not yet to be in force because the details of how it will work, and the necessary rules, are still being developed.\nAnderson declined to speak to the Guardian: he responded to Vince\u2019s criticism in two long statements on the club\u2019s website, saying in the first that he found it \u201cvery disrespectful and misleading to say the least\u201d \u2013 but he did not address the issue of Doidge\u2019s unpaid wages.\n\u201cI will not drop to the levels that [Vince] did in his various allegations to the press as I believe it will serve no practical purpose,\u201d Anderson said.\nThe BWFC Supporters Trust wrote to the EFL on Tuesday expressing \u201cgrave concerns about the financial stability and sustainability of our club under the current ownership\u201d, and Anderson will face protests at the home match against West Bromwich Albion on 21 January, announced by six fans\u2019 blog sites.

Sign up now!\nTottenham Hotspur have a long and grand musical tradition stretching all the way back to the early 1960s, when they became the first English club side to appropriate the US marching song John Brown\u2019s Body and started banging on about glory, glory. Then there was the 1973 single Nice One Cyril, a celebration of left back Cyril Knowles that earned songwriters Helen Clarke and Harold Spiro an Ivor Novello Award, for goodness sake. And of course we all love the great rockney triptych Ossie\u2019s Dream, Tottenham Tottenham, and When The Year Ends In One by the popular pub-singalong trio Chas, Dave & The Drummer From Chas \u2018n\u2019 Dave.

The Fiver suggests they look no further than the discography of Bernard Cribbins. The former Norwich and Manchester United defender, due to take over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday next month, had a couple of smash-hit records back in the day, and either would capture the very essence of the modern Tottenham Hotspur. Right Said Fred tells the story of two interior designers systematically demolishing a building in their increasingly incompetent attempts to shift an awkward piece of furniture; Hole In The Ground essays the hapless travails of a civil engineer digging some foundations to incorrect specifications. Yes, this is our pitifully contrived way of saying, on a very slow news day, that the new gaff\u2019s been delayed again.\nReasons for the latest setback haven\u2019t been announced. Perhaps half a ton of rubble landed on Fred\u2019s head upon giving the ceiling a mighty blow with his crowbar, or maybe a trench was dug round when it ought to be square. Or it could be that Mauricio Pochettino keeps turning up on site, absolutely raging, and ripping out all the wiring for the VAR equipment. The Fiver\u2019s uncharacteristically light on details. But we do know that Spurs will now be forced to play their next four home league fixtures, including the visit of Arsenal, at Wembley, a sequence taking them into March when the new place was supposed to open last August. \u201cI should like to apologise to blah fans blah continued patience blah commitment to deliver an exceptional matchday experience,\u201d cut-and-pasted chief suit Daniel Levy from the press release issued the last time Spurs did this.

These are difficult times for Murray and although the five-times Australian Open finalist could be a dangerous first\u2011round opponent for a seeded player, it was troubling to hear him express concerns over his future after losing to Daniil Medvedev in Brisbane last week. It remains to be seen how far he can push his body over the course of five sets.\nAge 24 Ranking 14 Seeding 13\nMurray\u2019s fitness problems have increased the pressure on Edmund and the British No 1 will be under the microscope after his stirring run to last year\u2019s semi-finals. Dealing with heightened expectations will not be easy for this shy young man. However Edmund has made smooth progress under his Swedish coach, Fredrik Rosengren, and his devastating forehand will give him a chance against anyone. It would be unwise to read too much into a rusty defeat to Yasutaka Uchiyama, the world No 163, in Brisbane.\nAge 23 Ranking 93 Seeding N/A\nThe left-hander is looking to maintain his progress after breaking into the top 100. Norrie enjoyed a good win over Beno\u00eet Paire in Auckland \u2013 where he grew up \u2013 and will be determined to make the most of his first appearance in the main draw at the Australian Open.\nAge 27 Ranking 38 Seeding N/A\nBritain\u2019s best woman fell down the rankings last year and ended up splitting with her coach, the American Michael Joyce, after failing to replicate the highs of 2017. Last season was difficult for Konta, who must prove that she was no flash in the pan. Konta has a new coach, the Frenchman Dimitri Zavialoff, and the 2016 Australian Open semi-finalist was feeling good about her game after beating Sloane Stephens in Brisbane. However, her withdrawal from the Sydney Open was a concern.\nAge 26 Ranking 93 Seeding N/A\nWatson has made it out of the first round in Melbourne on only two occasions and her recent grand slam form does not inspire confidence. The 26-year-old has also had a sticky start to the year, losing to Marta Kostyuk in qualifying for Brisbane and Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round at Hobart. The player who almost stunned Serena Williams at Wimbledon four years ago is rarely seen these days.\nAge 22 Ranking 99 Seeding N/A\nBoulter\u2019s first task this year is to hold on to her place in the top 100. That will provide her with a solid platform to keep improving. Boulter has already had a taste of grand slam action, beating Ver\u00f3nica Cepede Royg before losing to Naomi Osaka at Wimbledon last year, and she will savour her first appearance in the main draw at the Australian Open.\nAge 28 Ranking 190 Seeding N/A\nA talent that promised so much has rather fizzled out in the past 18 months. Evans seemed to be on to a good thing when he reached the fourth round of the Australian Open in 2017, only for his career to hit a dead end when he received a one\u2011year ban after testing positive for cocaine. Evans, who returned to the tour last April, now has a chance of redemption.\nAge 31 Ranking 187 Seeding N/A\nInjuries have stopped Ward from making the most of his early potential and the suspicion is that his best years are behind him. He barely played a match of any note in 2018 and has not featured in a grand slam since a first-round defeat to Marcos Baghdatis 18 months ago.\nWard battled back from a set down to defeat home favourite Maverick Banes in the first round of qualifying which set up a meeting in the next stage with Argentinian Marco Trungelliti.\nAge 22 Ranking 132 Seeding N/A\nQualifying for Brisbane at the expense of Andrea Petkovic was a good way for the Londoner to start her season, even if she followed it up with a heavy defeat to Anastasija Sevastova. Dart will need more of that fearlessness after qualifying for the main draw in Melbourne for the first time and beating France\u2019s Chloe Paquet in the first qualifying round. No doubt she will draw on the experience of earning a Wimbledon wild card and playing well in a first-round defeat to Karolina Pliskova last year.",

However, with owner Mike Ashley having yet to make progress in his attempts to sell the club, Newcastle have yet to submit an offer anywhere near Atlanta\u2019s valuation of \u00a330m and the 24-year-old\u2019s representative is adamant he will not be allowed to leave unless they increase their bid.\n\u201cThere are two to three clubs in England that have interest in him, but we haven\u2019t advanced a lot yet,\u201d Daniel Campos told the Paraguayan radio station ABC Cardinal. \u201cIf Newcastle raise their offers, they could be one of the clubs, but there are other clubs. There are clubs from England, Germany, Italy and Spain that are interested in Miguel Almir\u00f3n, but we aren\u2019t going to rush things.\n\u201cWith Newcastle, I spoke about the player\u2019s salary, but the club needs to raise their offers with Atlanta if they want to get the player. Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s value is high, it\u2019s not for any club to sign him.\u201d\nReports on Tyneside on Monday suggested that Newcastle had pulled out of the race to sign him due to \u201castronomical\u201d wage demands of \u00a3100,000 a week but that is not understood to be the case. Rafael Ben\u00edtez has identified Almir\u00f3n as his preferred transfer target as Newcastle bid for Premier League survival.\nMeanwhile, Ayoze P\u00e9rez has admitted there is something \u201cwrong\u201d at Newcastle as they prepare to face Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge. They have won only just four times in all competitions this season, a run which culminated in Saturday\u2019s 1-1 FA Cup third round draw with Blackburn at St James\u2019 Park.\nAsked about that game, P\u00e9rez said: \u201cSomething is wrong. It wasn\u2019t good enough, but we have to keep going now. It\u2019s going to be a long January but we must stick together and face up to it.\u201d\nAsked to elaborate, the 25-year-old Spaniard added: \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly, but it is a strange thing. You can\u2019t struggle as much as we are in home games. That means something is wrong. It is strange because there is no consistency. Sometimes it is individual performances, sometimes it\u2019s not like that and it\u2019s team performance.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be individual every time as we have changed players and rotated. I think there is a piece of the jigsaw that is missing. It is holding us back and it\u2019s why we are struggling. We\u2019ve won twice at home and that\u2019s just not acceptable. It\u2019s not good enough so something should change.\u201d",

She\u2019s an ex-banker, has been married for 20 years and has three children. In her maiden solo set, she ignores the world of finance \u2013 saving it for a future show, perhaps? \u2013 and talks exclusively about things domestic. Sandhog is her treatise on long-term marriage, asking: How do you make it last? What\u2019s love got to do with it? And, most importantly \u2013 with frequent reference to Vee\u2019s battle of wits with her Danish husband \u2013 who wins?\nIt can feel as much like a lesson as an entertainment. Vee (full name Venkatanarayanan) has a teacherly style: her pacing deliberate, her core principles imparted to the audience by rote, her high-status manner implying wisdom to convey. This feels a bit deflating early on, as you accept that the jokes here may be frugally disbursed. But it has its rewards. Yes, marital cliches crop up in Sandhog, but Vee\u2019s spirit of inquiry feels genuine and she poses insightful questions about the rewards and unromantic realities of lifelong partnerships.\nThe cliches don\u2019t detain us long. There are throwaway mother-in-law gags, and a routine about farting in bed as a relationship landmark. A snippet of humdrum domestic conversation brings to mind Bridget Christie\u2019s funnier and more extreme take on similar bland exchanges. Like many minority ethnic comics before her, Vee jokes about parental discipline, citing her Indian mum\u2019s no-nonsense approach. Once choice gag finds Vee\u2019s son calling her \u201cintrusive\u201d. Her response \u2013 and the withering look that accompanies it \u2013 makes mincemeat of the complaint.\nWinning such arguments, according to Vee, is what family life is all about. I wasn\u2019t persuaded by that: her smugness feels forced. But there\u2019s hard-won authenticity elsewhere, in the contrast drawn between getting and staying married, the riff on love in a decades-long relationship (\u201cso much of this feels like hate\u201d), and her routine in which she proposes that \u201ckids are to marriage as tsunamis are to beach holidays\u201d. It\u2019s an engaging debut, in which our ex-banker host measures out the profits and losses of domestic commitment, and finds herself just about in the black.\n At Soho theatre, London, until 19 January and from 6 to 16 May. Also touring from 1 February to 3 April.",

The two parties share similar anti-immigration, anti-Muslim and Eurosceptic views.\nHe said during a press conference with the Polish interior minister, Joachim Brudzi\u0144ski, that the Europe that could emerge after the elections could bring about a \u201crenaissance of European values\u201d and \u201clead us away from the one that is run by bureaucrats\u201d.\nBrudzi\u0144ski praised Salvini\u2019s hardline immigration strategy, which has included closing off Italian ports to migrant boats, adding that the two countries shared common goals such as \u201cstrengthening borders\u201d and helping to improve conditions in migrants\u2019 home countries.\nSalvini first mooted the idea of a pan-European network of nationalist parties weeks after forming a coalition government with former arch rival, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), last June.\nHe has already forged a partnership with the French far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, with the pair saying during a press conference in Rome in October that the EU elections would usher in a new era of \u201ccommon sense\u201d as nationalist parties rally to restore values, pride and dignity for ordinary workers.\nAt the same time, Salvini\u2019s coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, announced that he was preparing an election manifesto with European populist groups that are in coherence with his M5S. He held a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday with Pawe\u0142 Kukiz, a former rock star who heads up Poland\u2019s Kukiz\u201915; Ivan Sincic, of Croatia\u2019s Living Wall and Karolina K\u00e4h\u00f6nen, the co-founder of Liike Nyt, which describes itself as a liberal political movement in Finland.\n\u201cThey are young but they have an ever-increasing consensus,\u201d Di Maio wrote on Facebook. \u201cThey are the coolest and most beautiful energies in Europe. Our dream is a Europe with more social rights, more innovation and less privileges. A Europe that puts the needs of its citizens first.\u201d\nDi Maio also sparked a row with France earlier this week after urging the yellow vests, who have held several violent anti-government protests since early December, to \u201cnot give up\u201d. He said the protests reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the M5S and he is planning to meet yellow vest activists over the next few days.\nAs Italy\u2019s two leaders\u2019 ramp up campaigning, the League is currently tipped to emerge as the biggest Italian party in the European elections. The party is polling at around 30%, slightly higher than the M5S.\n\u201cSalvini has the same slogans as the rightwing parties in Europe but essentially different strategies, so I wonder if they would be truly powerful in a new EU parliament,\u201d said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Rome\u2019s Sapienza University.\n\u201cAs for M5S, Di Maio knows that by saying something sympathetic about the yellow vests, they are trying to boost popularity by reminding people that \u2018we were revolutionary too\u2019. But he\u2019s being naive \u2013 he\u2019s interfering in French politics and is not considering how a minister should be within a European context.\u201d",

        "content": "Your editorial (The government has failed. It\u2019s time to go back to the people, 9 January) pinpoints many issues as to why the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, but then perversely creates the wrong solution to the clear and decisive voice of the British people.\nThe dispossessed were given a voice as the sovereignty of parliament was transferred to its citizens via a referendum. The UK has respected every decision of every referendum in the past. Our remain top-heavy parliament is creating difficulties for itself; the answer is to listen more carefully to the people and not to ask the people to speak more clearly.\nYour call for humility on behalf of those who failed to hear the people\u2019s cry is not best displayed by not fulfilling the instructions of those very same people who we recognise have had enough.\nThe Guardian wants to see a reformed UK in a reformed EU, but it is evident that the EU is not for reforming other than to continue its repetitive march towards the United States of Europe that you say you do not want. The EU is simply not for turning away from closer integration on finances, foreign policy, defence structures and ever closer integration as it engineers the tools that in the end create our ultimate governance from a remote, undemocratic, elitist Brussels. It failed to heed the overtures from David Cameron in 2016, and it is on broadcast mode only as we try to negotiate our withdrawal from its institutions.\nThe Guardian too is on broadcast mode. We must respect our own tools of democracy, and simply because parliament is in contempt of the people is not sufficient reason to further enrage those who have spoken to ask for greater clarity on what they meant when they said \u201cenough\u201d of this project.\nEntrepreneur and international hotelier Rocco Forte, writing on the same day in another publication, writes lucidly about the strengths of the UK economy and its significant standing in the world. He is confident about the steps that need to be taken to deliver on the vote and our continued and expansive role with the rest of the world. He points out that the EU sold \u00a3341bn of goods to us last year and the leverage that our \u00a395bn deficit with the EU gives us if only we used it.\nSo instead of dressing up our disappointment in the result of the people\u2019s vote of 2016, and pretending that failing to listen to its call is ultimately nothing other than Orwellian doublespeak, let us embrace the opportunities that have been offered by the boldness and astuteness of our ultimate bosses: the people. To deny them their Brexit would certainly be the worst of all worlds and would most certainly put us in uncharted waters \u2013 and the repercussions of that would be dire.Nigel Evans MPConservative, Ribble Valley\n Your leader makes good points, but is once again based on the assertion, also maintained in the past by the Observer, that the referendum result was valid \u2013 \u201cWe accepted, without enthusiasm, that leave had won\u201d. Thanks largely to the investigative reporting for which the Scott Trust is revered and supported, we know that a number of factors subverted the referendum. Several of these abuses were claimed, indeed claimed by the perpetrators themselves, to have swung the narrow result; the fact that they did so when added together must now be almost certain. At the very least they render the result unsafe as a premise upon which to decide the fate of our nation.\nSurely the Guardian and the Observer should change their stance on this vital issue in the light of the evidence to which they have themselves contributed with such distinction. Then we will have more hope that our elected representatives will change their stance as well.James WillisAlton, Hampshire\n Your editorial on Brexit omits to mention a key factor that is used to argue against a second referendum \u2013 that to hold one would disrespect the democratic will of the people. Such a view ignores two glaringly obvious facts. One, the leave majority was extremely slim and therefore cannot be considered to represent a single \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Two, democracy was gloriously disrespected by those who made promises that have turned out to be fanciful at best and blatant falsehoods at worst. Now that the people have seen enough evidence upon which to base their rational judgment, their democratic right to express it must be restored.Dr Allan DoddsBramcote, Nottinghamshire\n Your leading article supports some mechanism such as that used recently in Ireland. This is potentially crucial for the future of this country in two particular ways. First, it addresses the basic question of who is fitted to guide our country\u2019s policy, and brings in the principle of randomness. Random selection applies no filters: not gender, not race, not education, not class, not wealth, not family connection. It therefore is revolutionary in, at last, assuming equal citizenship. Who owns the country? All its citizenry.\nSecond, the mechanism includes study of the issues. It brings together a number of citizens small enough over a reasonable period of time to become well informed on the principles and technicalities involved. It is not a marketing campaign, but an educational enterprise. I rejoice.Howard HiltonAudlem, Cheshire\n Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) \u201cThe message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal\u201d I believe that is true; 2) \u201cand that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.\u201d I believe that is true; 3) \u201cThe government has failed\u201d I believe that is true; 4) \u201c\u2026 so we must go back to the people.\u201d If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true.\nThe 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren\u2019t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen?\nI believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question \u201cCan article 50 be revoked?\u201d has been: \u201cIt\u2019s not government policy\u201d. Presumably that means \u201cyes\u201d. So, that\u2019s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people\u2019s vote in a general election.Celia WilsonDidcot, Oxfordshire\n Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens\u2019 assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That\u2019s why I, and no doubt other Guardian readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people\u2019s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate.Keith FlettLondon\n The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it. It won\u2019t be the first time parliament has ignored the so-called public will.Michael HeatonWarminster, Wiltshire\n For once, a leading article that leads: thank you. You should give credit where it\u2019s due by acknowledging that it was Gordon Brown who put the idea of a citizens\u2019 assembly on the table in his November speech at the Institute for Government.Willy McCourtLondon\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "Former homeless women star in award-winning story about sleeping rough in the north\nAt a time when France is facing street protests about social injustice, a comedy about homeless women in the north is being tipped as one of the funniest and most moving films of the year.\nLes Invisibles, which opened in French cinemas on Wednesday, tells the story of women sleeping rough in northern France as a social work centre is threatened with closure.\nMany the main characters are played by former homeless women who are not professional actors. Adolpha van Meerhaeghe, 70, who plays one of the homeless characters, used to sleep rough outside Lille station and served time in prison for the manslaughter of her violent husband before writing a book about her story.\nShe said her \u201cbig mouth\u201d served her well on the streets and helped with her acting. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sleep outside and keep your personality. Humour kept me alive.\u201d\nThe film \u2013 in which the homeless women adopt pseudonyms like \u201cLady Di\u201d and \u201cBrigitte Macron\u201d (the French president\u2019s wife) \u2013 was feted at the Angoul\u00eame film festival last year as an ode to \u201cthe modern women of the resistance\u201d \u2013 those on the streets and the female social workers helping them. Several other French festivals have given the film awards.\nThe director, Louis-Julien Petit, known for his earlier film Discount, about supermarket workers in the former Nord-Pas-de-Calais, spent a year volunteering in women\u2019s homeless shelters in Grenoble and Paris, saying he wanted to get the tone of the film right. \u201cI had a lot of preconceived ideas but when I was in the shelters, what I found was people who were just like me,\u201d he said.\nCorinne Masiero, a French actor who plays a social worker, said the film worked because of its \u201cmix of humour and seriousness\u201d, which meant the audience did not look down on the women but saw them as equals. \u201cThe viewer realises anyone could end up in that situation themselves,\u201d she said. She revealed that in her teens and early 20s she had also slept rough as she struggled with addictions.\nMasiero, who once ran for municipal elections for the leftwing party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), told Le Parisien she was a supporter of the ongoing gilets jaunes anti-government protest movement and had demonstrated several times. \u201cHow can you respect a system that hands privileges to people who are already ultra-privileged?\u201d she said.\nAudrey Lamy, another actor, said the film \u201cbrings women who are in the shadows into the light without judging them. The laughter makes you think.\u201d",

        "content": "Hugh Jackman stars as the US Democrat whose presidential ambitions were scuppered by allegations of misbehaviour on board the Monkey Business\nIs there any point now in remembering Gary Hart? He was the Democrats\u2019 plausible and photogenic US presidential candidate in 1988, the front runner who abandoned his campaign after press allegations of an extramarital affair. Was he, like the charismatic Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, a lost prince of progressive American politics \u2013 a man who might have saved his country from the complacent Bush dynasty? Or was he just another withdrawn brand in what Gore Vidal called the eternally dull Pepsi/Coke choice of American democracy?\nIt\u2019s not easy to tell from Jason Reitman\u2019s clotted and evasive movie, starring Hugh Jackman in a hairpiece as Hart. The film somehow shows its hero as a tiresome and sanctimonious figure while piously averting its eyes from his misdemeanour, the one thing that makes Hart dramatically interesting \u2013 his supposed sexual encounter with the young would-be campaign worker Donna Rice. The movie shows Hart going to the party on board the boat in Miami (unfortunately and notoriously called Monkey Business) and meeting Rice, but solemnly declines to show her face or what precisely went on. For a while, it seems as if having a mysterious void where Rice should be might constitute the film\u2019s stylised and rather experimental rationale, maybe to suggest the alienated, dehumanised nature of politics.\nBut no. After a solid hour, Rice is finally produced on camera (a perfectly capable and forthright performance from Sara Paxton), tearfully telling her story to Hart\u2019s careworn spin doctors as the media storm breaks. It feels pointless and supercilious to have withheld her presence until this moment, as if the movie itself has been uneasily forced to acknowledge this woman\u2019s existence, just as Hart\u2019s tense campaign team was. She gets a perfunctory scene designed to show that she has feelings and a college degree, too, and a budding sisterly relationship with a concerned young (fictional) woman on Hart\u2019s staff. Then she departs the stage. Crucially, the film is uncertain whether to feel angry at the media\u2019s new tabloid tactics, or to welcome a brusque new honesty, after the press had so long winked at the adulterous antics of JFK and the like.\nJackman \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u00ad\u2013 portrays Hart as an unrelaxed, unsmiling figure, without the charm or buoyancy of his other recent performances. Vera Farmiga has the thankless and underwritten role of his loyal wife, Lee, and JK Simmons plays the gruff campaign manager Bill Dixon. Together, they all inhabit a world chock-full of mannerisms borrowed from Robert Altman\u2019s Nashville and Alan J Pakula\u2019s All the President\u2019s Men, particularly in the very showy but very pointless sequence in the crowded convention centre in 1984 when Hart abandons his first run at power. The camera roams this way and that in the media scrum, and as in subsequent scenes, the dialogue is overlapping and borderline unintelligible. It is bravura work in its way, but unconnected to any real dramatic energy or political point.\nLater, we get some by-the-numbers scenes at the Washington Post, with Alfred Molina as Ben Bradlee and everyone doing cynical-wisecrack journalist dialogue to each other. When the Miami Herald gets a sniff of the Hart story from an anonymous informant, there is a bizarre scene in which its journalists have to stake out the candidate\u2019s Washington townhouse for their somewhat chaotic scoop. In fact, as they realise that it is a scoop, the film gets its own weirdly residual buzz of conspiratorial excitement, which is rather undermined in the Washington Post scene when Bob Woodward haughtily declines to spill the beans about the personal lives of important people he knows.\nNever is there a scene between Hart and Rice \u2013 a scene that might have humanised them both and actually made Hart politically interesting \u2013 and not much of one between Hart and his wife, when he is forced to withdraw. We prudently finish the story before the discovery of that embarrassing photo with Rice sitting on Hart\u2019s lap.\nSo why in the end is Hart interesting? Because he made Bush Sr possible? Maybe. Or perhaps it\u2019s more that he, paradoxically, made Bill Clinton possible, and the voters, wearied by the lacklustre Bush presidency, were prepared to give philandering Bill a chance in 1992. Which perhaps means the second question is: did loyal Lee Hart make Hillary Clinton possible? I\u2019d like to see a whole film about Lee, or a whole film about Donna.",

The paper says Parakilas\u2019 job will involve working to ensure that future products minimise data collection and protect privacy.\nParakilas had spent the last year working as the chief strategy officer of the San Francisco-based Center for Humane technology, a not-for-profit organisation set up by former Silicon Valley workers to push for \u201csafer, healthier tech\u201d.\nParakilas told the Guardian at the time that he had warned senior executives that it risked a major breach. \u201cMy concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,\u201d he said.\nParakilas also gave evidence to the UK parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, which in 2018 investigated the abuses at Facebook as part of its inquiry into fake news. He told the inquiry that Facebook had given the impression that it feared it would be liable if it investigated a suspected breach and found policies or laws had been broken. Instead, he suggested, it did not investigate because it felt that if it did not know of breaches it could claim it was just a platform so not liable.\nIn competition against rivals such as Facebook and Google, Apple has been pushing its privacy practices as a strength, culminating this week in adverts at the Las Vegas-based Consumer Electronics Show bearing the slogan: \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.\u201d Unlike Google, Apple is not exhibiting at the show.\nApple declined to comment.

A criminal investigation was launched by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).\nThe London-based company indicated a guilty plea at Brighton magistrates court to a charge under health and safety laws of being an employer failing to discharge its duty to ensure people were not exposed to risk.\nThe magistrates court heard the company would be admitting the offence formally at a crown court sentencing hearing next month in front of a judge with the power to impose an unlimited fine.\nThe company had a turnover of \u00a3134m for the year ending 2016 and the starting point for the fine would be \u00a32.4m, said the prosecutor, Sarah Le Fevre.\nThe teenager was an NHS-funded patient in the Priory\u2019s care. Le Fevre told the court Amy had a known and recent history of suicide attempts which continued during her time there. She was left with unsupervised access and a means to carry out another attempt, the court heard.\nThe HSE investigation concluded that \u201cprocedures for the management of ligature risk had not resulted in effective measures\u201d, Le Fevre said. An inquest in 2016 heard neglect contributed to her death, finding she had died accidentally of unintended consequences of a deliberate act.\nThe company is expected to be sentenced at Lewes crown court on 6 February.\nResponding to the plea, Amy\u2019s mother, Tania El-Keria, said: \u201cAmy was my dearly loved youngest daughter, a sister, niece and granddaughter with her whole life ahead of her.\u201d\nIn a statement through the charity Inquest, she said it had taken \u201csix long years\u201d for the company to be brought to court. \u201cThe only thing that has kept me going is to achieve justice for Amy and to stop other families going through the torture we have endured. Today is a huge step forward achieving this. The guilty plea is a bitter but long-awaited acknowledgement from the Priory of their criminal failure.\u201d\nThe Priory Group said in a statement: \u201cWe are truly sorry that this very sad incident occurred and extend our deepest sympathies to Amy\u2019s family. We continue to invest significantly in improving safety at Ticehurst. The hospital is making strong progress under new leadership and continues to be rated \u2018good\u2019 in all areas by the CQC,\u201d the health and social care regulator.\nVictoria McNally, a senior caseworker at Inquest, said the family had been \u201cfailed by a system that placed Amy in the care of a private company, now exposed as operating criminally inadequate standards.\n\u201cThe government must now review whether the Priory is fit to receive such significant public expenditure for the provision of children\u2019s specialist mental health care.\u201d\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

        "content": "South Korea and US teams say infertility could be linked to deficiency of a protein in womb\nA new study has cast light on why some women with endometriosis experience infertility, with scientists saying the finding could lead to new treatment options.\nEndometriosis is an inflammatory condition in which cells that usually form the lining of the uterus are present elsewhere, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, pelvis and rectum.\nIts causes are unclear, but more than one in 10 women of reproductive age are thought to be living with endometriosis. The actors Lena Dunham and Whoopi Goldberg are among the prominent figures who have spoken out about having the condition.\nAs well as causing chronic pain in some women, endometriosis can lead to other problems including infertility. \u201cAround 10% of women have endometriosis and up to 50% of endometriosis patients have infertility,\u201d said Jae-Wook Jeong, co-author of the research from Michigan State University.\nThe reasons why only some women experience infertility are unclear. But now researchers say they have shed light on what might be causing it, finding that it could be linked to a deficiency of a protein in the womb.\nWriting in the journal Science Translational Medicine, scientists in the US and South Korea describe how they studied samples from 21 women with endometriosis and infertility. They found that the women had lower levels of a molecule called HDAC3 in the lining of the uterus compared with fertile women without endometriosis. HDAC3, said Jeong, is a type of molecule which is involved in controlling the levels of proteins that particular genes give rise to.\nScientists\u2019 experiments showed that when endometriosis was purposefully induced in baboons and mice, levels of HDAC3 in the lining of the uterus of these animals also dropped.\nThe team produced mice without the gene necessary to produce HDAC3 in the uterus, and found those animals were sterile \u2013 apparently because the lining of the uterus did not undergo the changes expected in preparation for pregnancy, and had problems with the implantation of an embryo.\nThe animals also had increased levels of certain collagens \u2013 fibrous proteins \u2013 in the tissues of the uterus, a finding also seen in women with endometriosis. The authors say the collagens appear to hinder changes to the uterus needed for pregnancy.\nFurther work in human cells suggested HDAC3 acts on a range of genes to affect levels of proteins involved in processes necessary for implantation and preparation of the uterus for pregnancy.\nJeong said it was not yet clear what was behind the initial drop in HDAC3, but he said the research hinted at possible therapies to tackle the impact of a deficiency. Measuring HDAC3 levels, he said, might also help steer women with endometriosis to the most suitable fertility treatment.\nChristian Becker, co-director of the Oxford Endometriosis Care Centre, welcomed the study but cautioned that the fertility tests were only carried out in mice, and that in both the mice and baboons endometriosis was induced unlike the spontaneous condition seen in women.\nAndrew Horne, from the MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, at the University of Edinburgh, said that while women with endometriosis could take longer to become pregnant than those without the condition, or be less likely to conceive, it did not mean infertility was a foregone conclusion. \u201cEndometriosis can be associated with difficulties becoming pregnant, but even women with severe endometriosis can still have a baby naturally,\u201d he said.",

Tugendhat had raised the issue directly with Hunt in a letter on 2 January after the practice was exposed by the Times.\nIn 2016 the Guardian and the Muslim Women\u2019s Network UK highlighted the practice of requiring victims of forced marriage to pay repatriation costs, highlighting the case of a 17-year-old British girl who arrived at the UK embassy in Islamabad in 2014 seeking help to escape a forced marriage.\nThe Foreign Office later announced it would amend its repatriation policy so that British 16- and 17-year-olds who got into difficulty abroad would no longer have to reimburse the government the costs of their journey home. The policy remained in place for people aged 18 and over.\nIn his letter, Tugendhat had warned the practice meant \u201cvictims may be forced to pay for their own rescue or, worse, may be dissuaded from asking for help if they have not got the funds\u201d.\nOn Wednesday Hunt said in reply: \u201cI have decided the victims of forced marriage who are helped to return to the UK by the Foreign Office forced marriage repatriation unit will no longer be asked to take out a loan for their repatriation costs.\u201d\nHe said the forced marriage unit was set up in 2005 on the basis that victims constituted a category of exceptionally vulnerable people in need of specific help.\n\u201cFrom now none of those who are assisted by the forced marriage unit will have to cover the costs of their repatriation,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWhere possible, the government will continue to seek to ensure the costs fall on the perpetrators by means of the forced marriage protection orders.\u201d The perpetrators are normally family members.\nHe claimed the number of people that had been subject to a requirement to pay their costs was relatively small. In 2016-17 the Foreign Office helped 82 individuals to return to the UK, but the vast majority had their costs of repatriation met by others. Only a small minority \u2013 between eight and 12 - had accessed Foreign Office loans, the department said.\nHunt said the government would ensure that victims with outstanding loans would find no further cost fell to them \u2013 a formulation designed to ensure that previous payments are not refunded. Any passports blocked pending the payment of an outstanding loan would be released, he said.\nCampaigners had said forced marriage was a form of slavery and victims should not be charged to regain their freedom.\nHunt said he wished to protect the principle that adult Britons who receive consular assistance will in general pay for their own travel home, but added: \u201cVictims of forced marriage may have endured particular suffering. They will often have travelled abroad against their wishes or under false pretences.\u201d\nHe said the treatment of vulnerable Britons should always be guided by compassion, adding he was glad to make the policy change.",

Below ground, we know we have a higher mass but of a different type \u2013 we don\u2019t yet have the research into the level of the toxicity, and hence the heath risk.\n\u201cYou\u2019re down there for a short period of time \u2013 passengers should just use the tube as usual until we have better understanding of the risks.\u201d\nTfL has accepted the recommendations in the report and will carry out further monitoring and testing of dust samples.\nWhile the tube operates well within the Health and Safety Executive specified limits, it has set an \u201cinformal target\u201d to limit exposure to dust.\nIt expanded its cleaning regime in 2017 with \u201cmagnetic wands\u201d to reduce dust at 46 stations, but a specialist tunnel-cleaning train was scrapped as unviable in 2014.\nPeter McNaught, director of asset operations at TfL, said: \u201cWe are committed to maintaining the cleanest air possible for our staff and customers when using the tube.\u201d\nCaroline Pidgeon, chair of the London Assembly transport committee, said more monitoring of dust and air pollution was vital: \u201cWe need to fully understand the health risk facing passengers and staff from being exposed to high levels of particulate matter.\u201d",

        "content": "PM is hosting drinks as part of Brexit charm offensive, but she has little left to offer her MPs\nChit-chat with Tory backbenchers was probably the last thing Theresa May was in the mood for after MPs voted to serve Downing Street with a three-day deadline for setting out a Brexit plan B.\nBut the prime minister hosted a Downing Street drinks party with colleagues on Wednesday night as part of a last-ditch charm offensive before next week\u2019s vote in parliament, which even close allies admit she looks set to lose by a significant margin.\nOne guest was the author of her latest misfortune \u2013 her Oxford contemporary and old friend Dominic Grieve, whose amendment has further narrowed her room for manoeuvre in the next few febrile days.\nIn one sense, the angry clashes at Westminster on Wednesday, and the second defeat for the government in two days, changed little. While, formally, the EU withdrawal act gave the government 21 days to return to the Commons if the vote were lost \u2013 to set out what it plans to do next \u2013 there would have been intense political pressure to do so sooner.\nMay had already reassured cabinet ministers that she would act more swiftly than that, and a government spokesman said on Wednesday: \u201cWe would seek to provide certainty, quickly.\u201d\nGrieve\u2019s amendment gives the UK prime minister a hard deadline, and underlines rebel backbenchers\u2019 determination to use every tactic at their disposal to bind her hands.\nBut almost as significant was the row that led to its passage, with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, facing down his own clerks, May\u2019s chief whip and the leader of the House of Commons, and insisting Grieve\u2019s amendment could be voted on.\nOne pro-EU Tory said of Bercow: \u201cHe was brilliant today, utterly brilliant.\u201d\nThe government fears it sets a precedent by jeopardising a key power \u2013 the ability to decide on the business of the House of Commons. With backbenchers conducting a guerrilla campaign against a no-deal Brexit, that is the last thing Downing Street needs.\nFor May, who sat implacable on the frontbench on Wednesday as the row raged around her, it was yet another heavy blow to her dented authority. But the prime minister made another significant concession, in an attempt to win over some leavers.\nThe Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the government would accept an amendment tabled by the Tory MP Hugo Swire. Among other things, if the future relationship with the EU were not negotiated by mid-2020, it would give MPs the chance to choose between extending the transition period and entering the Irish backstop.\nWill the proposal solve anything?\nThe mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u00a0\nThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u00a0\nBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u00a0\nThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u00a0\nIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u00a0\nThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u00a0\nThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u00a0\nBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u00a0\nThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u00a0 a no-deal Brexit.\u00a0\nExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between \u00a310bn and \u00a317bn.\u00a0\nStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u00a0European court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u00a0\nDowning Street is also expecting some assurances from the EU27 between now and the moment of truth next Tuesday, though not the overhaul of the legally binding withdrawal agreement the Democratic Unionist party had demanded.\nUltimately, though, few at Westminster believe May\u2019s earlier tactic of sending MPs off home for Christmas to calm down and think about their responsibility to deliver on the referendum, had altered the dynamic in this deeply divided parliament.\nAnd as the fraught discussions at cabinet on Tuesday underlined, there are scant few options available if the vote is lost, and none of them look appealing.\nMay could make another mad dash to Brussels; give MPs the opportunity to vote on a series of alternative Brexit options (which Tory whips believe might focus minds on the lack of a majority for any alternative to their deal); announce that she plans to leave without a deal; or even press the nuclear button and promise a general election.\nWhatever she does she will almost certainly face a full-blown vote of no confidence from Jeremy Corbyn within days or even hours of the vote next Tuesday.\nBefore the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, losing a vote on the finance bill on one day and another less than 24 hours later would have most likely proved fatal to a government\u2019s authority.\nBut opposition parties now need to win a formal vote of no confidence and it is unclear whether either the DUP or Tory rebels hate the deal enough to want to tear down the government.\nMay cannot now be unseated by Tory MPs, who tried the no confidence gambit before Christmas and failed, and her cabinet is bitterly divided about the way forward.\nSome Tory colleagues believe the prime minister\u2019s fabled resilience is such that she could try to keep putting her much maligned deal to MPs, grimly pressing home the fact that, as she repeatedly said on Wednesday, \u201cthe only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal\u201d.\nWhichever path she chooses, more dramatic clashes with parliament lie ahead within a matter of days, however calm the chatter over the canapes at No 10.",

They said that by arresting two Canadian citizens as retaliation for Canada\u2019s detention of Meng, China was bullying Canada. To those people, China\u2019s self-defence is an offence to Canada,\u201d Lu wrote.\nAlex Lawrence, a spokesman for Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, did not address Lu\u2019s claims.Huawei, whose billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei has long had ties with both the People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Communist party, has faced national security concerns in multiple countries.\nHuawei has been banned from involvement in the installation of 5G mobile networks in India, New Zealand and Australia, blocked from making acquisitions in the US and banned from selling phones on military bases by the Pentagon.\nBut, in his column, Lu dismissed such concerns and instead pointed to monitoring and spying programs carried out by the US National Security Agency and the Five Eyes alliance countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US).\n\u201cSomething is considered as \u2018safeguarding national security\u2019 when it is done by western countries.

        "content": "Labour leader will use speech on Thursday to reiterate demand if PM cannot get Brexit deal past MPs\nJeremy Corbyn is to reiterate his call for the Brexit impasse to be put to the people in a general election, as Labour edged closer to pledging to call a no-confidence vote in Theresa May\u2019s government if her departure plan is voted down in the Commons.\nAt a speech in Wakefield on Thursday, the Labour leader is to argue that if May is unable to get her flagship piece of legislation past MPs next week then her government will have lost all authority, meaning an election is urgently needed.\n\u201cSo I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,\u201d he will say, according to extracts from the speech released in advance.\n\u201cTo break the deadlock an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option. It would give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in parliament and across the country.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s policy on Brexit is to first of all seek a general election, and only if that does not happen to consider the idea of a second referendum, a stance which has prompted some pressure from a membership predominantly keener on another referendum.\nThe party has also avoided specifics on when it might push for an election, something it could force under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act by winning a specifically worded motion of no confidence in the government.\nOn Wednesday, two of Corbyn\u2019s frontbenchers indicated this moment could come very soon after what Labour hopes will be defeat for the government when the delayed vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal finally happens next Tuesday.\nBarry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cObviously, the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the government.\u201d\nSpeaking later on Sky News, Andrew Gwynne, the shadow communities secretary, confirmed the plan. Asked if this meant a confidence vote would come \u201cnext week, basically\u201d if May lost the vote. Gwynne replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nAccording to the extracts of his speech, Corbyn will say Labour will vote against the \u201cbad deal\u201d proposed by the prime minister.\n\u201cIf the government cannot pass its most important legislation, then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity,\u201d he will say. \u201cA government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.\u201d\nOn the wider issue of national divisions, Corbyn is to argue that Brexit is more of a symbol than a cause of splits. \u201cThe real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many, who do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes, and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re living in Tottenham, you may well have voted to remain. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re living in Mansfield, you are likely to have voted to leave. You\u2019ve got high bills, rising debts, you\u2019re in insecure work, you struggle to make your wages stretch, and you may be on universal credit and accessing food banks. You\u2019re up against it.\u201d\nWhile some people saw the EU as \u201cpart of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility\u201d, the real issue was a wider system which entrenched the power of an elite, he will say.\nDuring the first prime minister\u2019s questions of 2019 on Wednesday, Corbyn mocked May over what he said was her failure to get any further assurances from EU leaders to placate Tory MPs or her Democratic Unionist party partners since pulling the vote planned for December.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the PM bringing back exactly the same deal she admitted would be defeated four weeks ago?\u201d he asked, saying the prime minister was offering only \u201cwindow dressing\u201d.\nTwice he asked May if she would discount the idea of no deal, especially after MPs backed an amendment to the finance bill from Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper to curb some of the government\u2019s tax administration powers in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU.\nMay responded by saying Corbyn was himself ruling out the only deal acceptable to Brussels. \u201cThe only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal,\u201d she said.",

Some of the country\u2019s best cyclists past and present \u2013 Amanda Spratt, Simon Gerrans, Robbie McEwen \u2013 have been crowned champion after triumphing on these treacherous Ballarat hills.\nBut Buninyong has never before seen someone quite like Sarah Gigante. Just 18, the Victorian had already impressed by winning the road race, time trial and criterium trifecta at last year\u2019s Under-19 national championships. Those feats, though, pale in comparison to her achievement of last Sunday. Riding against Australia\u2019s best female riders, including world No 2 Spratt, Gigante attacked on the penultimate lap. Barely days into her first season out of the junior ranks, the recent high school graduate held off a determined chase to win both the elite and Under-23 categories \u2013 an Australian first.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it \u2013 this is a dream come true,\u201d Gigante tells Guardian Australia. Having joined an early breakaway on the first lap, the youngster stayed with the front group as its numbers dwindled. When a small gap emerged between her, Sarah Roy and Shara Gillow, Gigante seized the opportunity. \u201cWhen the gap opened it was a complete surprise. I thought: \u2018it is now or never \u2013 I may as well try.\u2019 It really paid off.\u201d\nThe magnitude of Gigante\u2019s upset is unprecedented. She was racing against the might of World Tour team Mitchelton-Scott, the second-best female team in the world, in one of the longest races she had ever contested. Victory should not have been possible. \u201cThe win did not sink in at all on Sunday \u2013 it was just a complete dream,\u201d says Gigante. \u201cI went to sleep in my national championship jersey \u2013 when I woke up the next morning it felt a bit more real.\u201d\nGigante\u2019s Buninyong glory caps a remarkable reversal of fortune. Last May the Victorian broke her elbow, shoulder and wrist following a club race crash. When Gigante told doctors she needed to be back racing by August, to contest the junior track world championships, they laughed.\nYet with a concerted rehabilitation effort, Gigante found herself at the world championships \u2013 claiming silver in the points race. She backed up a month later to represent Australia in the junior category of the road world championships in Austria, before flying home to sit her final exams. Although unable to write for several months during the school year due to her injuries \u2013 she instead relied on her mother to transcribe homework \u2013 Gigante received a perfect Atar score of 99.95.\nDespite her pride at the result \u2013 securing a place studying science at the University of Melbourne \u2013 Gigante says the green and gold stripes are an even bigger achievement. \u201cThis is more exciting than my Atar,\u201d she laughs. Gigante is also quick to acknowledge the role of her family in her recent successes. \u201cMy family are proud of me no matter what,\u201d she says. \u201cThis victory is icing on the cake \u2013 but they love me for the passion I have and the hard work I put in.\u201d\n2019 will see Gigante commence her university studies and race domestically and internationally with Roxsolt-Attaquer. She may have a busy year ahead, but after enduring a trying 2018 Gigante is not phased. \u201cLast year was really tough with year 12, the injuries and lengthy recovery period. As long as something like that does not happen again it won\u2019t be too bad.\u201d\nWith her dual academic and sporting ambitions, it remains unclear where Gigante\u2019s future will lead. \u201cI want to take cycling as far as I can,\u201d she says. \u201cI love the sport and have ever since I started when I was eight. Hopefully I can keep doing that for a long time coming, keeping improving and keep going overseas. But it is good to have balance \u2013 studying gives me something to fall back on. Cycling can change so quickly.\u201d\nShe may be wearing national colours in 2019 \u2013 something she admits is \u201cquite the honour\u201d \u2013 but Gigante is not getting ahead of herself. Asked about the 2020 Olympics, she modestly demurs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Tokyo is on my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is a long way in the future \u2013 two years away. Anything can happen. I will just focus on the now.\u201d\nBarely an adult, Gigante is already a national champion, has represented Australia internationally in two cycling disciplines and aced her year 12 exams. Is there anything this friendly young rider, mature beyond her years, does not excel at? \u201cCleaning my room,\u201d she quips.",

The implications, not only for domestic food supply but for the careful management of our cherished countryside, would represent an historic political failure,\u201d said the four main farmers\u2019 unions, including the National Farmers Union, in a letter to MPs.\nSeparately, tenant farmers and landowners have written to MPs warning of a no-deal disaster.\n\u201cThis is a recipe for disaster for all farmers and ultimately will cause long-term damage to the rural communities and countryside of our nation,\u201d said the Country Land and Business Association and the Tenant Farmers Association in a joint letter.\nThey also want assurances over the prospect of lower-quality food such as chlorinated chicken, currently banned by the EU, entering the market in a no-deal scenario. They said the thought that the standards of British farming could be \u201cundermined by cheaper, lower-quality, imports\u201d was a major concern.\nThe NFU, NFU Cymru, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers\u2019 Union, said the impacts of no deal would mean a potential trade embargo on UK meat and plant products.\nThey raised similar concerns in September but feel that few grasp the implications of Britain becoming a \u201cthird country\u201d in relation to the EU.\nThey have been told that 6,000 meat processing plants that export to the EU will have to undergo individual audits by British authorities which must then be certified in Brussels. These will then be checked by EU officials and put to a standing veterinary committee for approval, a process that the NFU has calculated will take six months \u201cat a conservative reading\u201d.\nIn its letter the NFU says this would lead to an \u201ceffective trade embargo on the export of UK animals and animal-based products\u201d. Farmers exporting products would face \u201cdraconian tariffs\u201d designed to make any non-EU products uncompetitive\u201d against EU food. The effective EU tariff would be 65% on beef, 46% on lamb and 27% on chicken, MPs have been told.\nSmall-scale sheep farmers, many of whom earn less than \u00a320,000 a year, are thought to be particularly vulnerable, with 21% of all lamb meat being exported and 94% of that to the EU. Almost 90% of all beef exports also went to the EU, according to 2017 figures.\nThe Farmers\u2019 Union of Wales has suggested that mountain sheep farmers would be \u201cwiped out\u201d by a no deal over Brexit.",

In a press release, the NPS expressed thanks to volunteers \u201cwho provided basic sanitation at campgrounds and other closed areas during the lapse in appropriations\u201d.\nFor 17 days, a host of volunteers and a skeleton staff kept the trash cans and toilets from overflowing at Joshua Tree national park.\nBut on Tuesday, 18 days after the federal government shutdown furloughed the vast majority of national park staff, officials announced that vandalism of the park\u2019s distinctive namesake plants and other maintenance and sanitation problems will require closure starting Thursday.\n\u201cWhile the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,\u201d spokesman George Land said in a news release.\nLand told the Los Angeles Times that, with only eight rangers currently overseeing the nearly 800,000 acre park, the gates would likely remain closed until the shutdown ends.\nBut a different spokesman for the National Parks Service, Mike Litterst, subsequently told the Times that the park may not close after all if staff are able to complete cleanup work before Thursday.\nNational Park Service officials did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\nThe potential closure of Joshua Tree was met with mixed emotions by those whose livelihoods depend on the more than 2.8 million visitors the park attracts annually.\n\u201cI have 11 employees who are effectively going to be laid off as of Thursday,\u201d said Seth Zaharias, co-owner of a company that leads rock climbing trips in the park. \u201cThey are not going to work for the remainder of the shutdown.\u201d\nStill, Zaharias said that reports of vandalism to the park made him support the closure. \u201cEconomically, that\u2019s disastrous for our community,\u201d he said of the prospect of serious environmental damage to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad.\u201d\nHis company was beginning to send out cancellation notices for customers who had booked trips after Thursday, he said.\nDavid Lamfrom, director of the California desert and national wildlife programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, warned that the damage to Joshua Tree\u2019s desert landscape could be catastrophic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly fragile landscape that takes generations and generations to grow, and generations and generations to heal,\u201d Lamfrom said. \u201cThe amount of time it takes to heal can be on the geological scale.\u201d\nLamfrom expressed frustration that community members had been placed in the position of trying to keep the park operating during the shutdown.\n\u201cFor business owners and community members to have to take up the mantle and the burden of running our national parks makes no sense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have professionals who are dedicated to doing that work, and they\u2019re sitting at home.\u201d\nLamfrom also warned that because most of the park\u2019s rangers are furloughed, the extent of environmental damage is likely still unknown.\n\u201cThe main story has been about poop, but I think there\u2019s a much bigger story,\u201d he said. \u201cThe resource impacts could be really dangerous.

There are hopes it could provide an insight into the birth of galaxies.\nA quasar is the extremely bright nucleus of an active galaxy and its powerful glow is created by the incredible amounts of energy released by gas falling towards the supermassive black hole at its centre.\nTuesday\u2019s hardware failure happened in the telescope\u2019s wide-field camera, which was installed by spacewalking astronauts in 2009. The camera has backup electronics that can be called into action if necessary, according to Nasa.\nThe camera has captured stunning images of stars, galaxies stretching far back in time and assisted in deep sky surveys. It has also studied objects in the solar system, discovering some of the tiny moons around Pluto, as well as a 14th moon around Neptune. It takes pictures in both visible and ultraviolet light, as well as near-infrared.\nOrbiting 350 miles (560km) above Earth, Hubble was launched in 1990 and visited by space shuttle astronauts for repairs and upgrades five times.\nIt recently stopped working altogether for three weeks because of a problem with its gyroscopes.\nThis is the first time the camera has acted up like this, said Cheryl Gundy, a spokeswoman with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which handles science operations for the telescope.\n\u201cNasa is trying to pull together the team to try to diagnose the issue,\u201d Gundy said.\n\u201cWe would like to have Hubble back up and working as quickly as possible, and Nasa is making that happen,\u201d even with the partial government shutdown, she said.",

        "content": "Patients awaiting treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Science are living in tents and on pavements for months at a time as the centre reels under the weight of demand\nThe night-time cold in New Delhi is biting. As the temperature plunges, Alam Ansari\u2019s twin daughters, born prematurely, have only their parents\u2019 body heat to keep them warm while they huddle in a crowded tent on the road outside the capital\u2019s top hospital.\nThey are not alone. Each day, about 8,000 people from across the country queue outside the outpatients department for treatment. Mainly from poorer backgrounds, they sleep in tents or on the ground.\nAnsari is rocking one of his three-month-old daughters. Something is wrong with both girls\u2019 eyes, but he doesn\u2019t know what. The family travelled to the All India Institute of Medical Science \u2013 known simply as AIIMS \u2013 after doctors in Bihar told them they were unable to offer treatment.\nThe train from their remote village to India\u2019s capital took two days. A construction worker, Ansari borrowed 40,000 rupees. \u201cThat\u2019s down to 5,000 rupees after being here two months. Every day we\u2019re sent here and there, from one doctor to another. I don\u2019t know what to do when my money runs out but I have to get my daughters well,\u201d he says.\nAmid the turmoil, the girls have yet to be named.\nAIIMS runs a shelter for patients from out of town, but it is packed. Ansari and his family are lucky to have found space in one of the temporary tents erected outside by the Delhi government at the start of winter to give sick patients a place to wait for appointments, test results, and treatment.\nInside, more than 100 people are wrapped in multi-coloured blankets in the gloom. They are mostly two to a bed; many are very sick and weak, having inhabited tents or lived on pavements outside the hospital for weeks, if not months.\nMillions of Indians find state hospitals are unable to help when they are seriously ill, leaving them no choice but to travel to New Delhi. AIIMS now operates in seven other states, but doctors at the hospitals outside New Delhi often lack specialist expertise. Patients are almost invariably referred to the capital.\nThe institute offers free consultations and some tests, although payment is still required for drugs.\nOften, people who come for treatment cannot afford to rent a room. Waiting for an appointment or follow-up consultation is too expensive, travelling to and fro too exhausting.\nSo they stay on, sleeping, eating and living on the pavement, under trees and flyovers, in the metro subway, under bus shelters, and on the floor of public toilets.\nChandi Devi, who spent three weeks sleeping in the metro subway before finding space in a tent, looks exhausted and downcast. \u201cMy father needs both his knee joints replaced. He can\u2019t walk. I have to ask others to help me take him to the toilet,\u201d says Devi, who has left behind her three young children to bring her father to AIIMs. He remains silent throughout, his single nylon blanket offering scant protection from the daytime chill, much less the night.\nPatients like Devi\u2019s father get hot meals provided by NGOs. They use public toilets and buy bottled water. Clothes are washed and hung out to dry on the iron railings lining the busy road outside the hospital.\nSpace under a footbridge is much sought after. The more fortunate manage to get a bed in shelters run by charities and religious trusts, but need far exceeds supply.\n\u201cOne day it\u2019s go to this doctor, another day it\u2019s go to another doctor. It\u2019s endless. It\u2019s been a month and they haven\u2019t even started treatment because they say they haven\u2019t got any beds,\u201d says Devi.\nIn the next bed is a mother with her son. He looks about seven years old, but she says he is 18 and has a \u201cgrowth problem\u201d. Beside her are a couple with a daughter who has mental health problems.\nOutside the tent, Shalini has been on the pavement for six months with her husband, who is paralysed. In the space under a footbridge, she has created a little \u201croom\u201d for her belongings, clothes and a few pots and pans.\nAtul Sethi is here with her father. \u201cHis kidneys have failed,\u201d she says, pointing to an emaciated figure on the ground, shrouded from head to toe in a white sheet. \u201cHe can\u2019t stand. We came four days ago from Madhya Pradesh and are still waiting to see a doctor.\u201d\nNearby, three-year-old Neelu, from a remote village in Jharkhand, is playing on the pavement by the government tents. Her \u201caccommodation\u201d is a makeshift bed erected on the road by her mother, Chunni Birhor. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep alongside so many people. The tent makes me feel claustrophobic, so I prefer to stay on the path with my daughter,\u201d says Birhor.\nNeelu smiles and scampers around. She looks healthy but Birhor says her daughter has blood cancer and will need to start treatment the moment a bed becomes available. Today is a good day. Often, Neelu doesn\u2019t even feel like getting up.\nMother and daughter have been on the pavement for a fortnight. Neelu\u2019s father, a mason from Madhopur in Uttar Pradesh, has gone to the chemist to buy his daughter some drugs. \u201cWe\u2019re spending without earning. Every day is a day\u2019s wages lost,\u201d says Birhor, whose daughter is one of many children suffering from cancer who can be found outside AIIMS.\nBy 6pm it is dark and the temperature dips. It\u2019s the rush hour and road next to the hospital is humming with traffic. The air is thick with smelly pollutants that sting the eyes.\nBack at the tent, one of Ansari\u2019s girls starts to cry. His wife takes her and starts to breastfeed. Even now, after two months living in a tent in the freezing cold trying to save the lives of his two infants,Ansari looks puzzled at his circumstances. \u201cI thought that AIIMS, being the top hospital, would have made some \u2018bandobast\u2019 [arrangements]\u2026\u201d\nThen he trailis off, sensing the futility of saying anything more.",

The report did not elaborate, but North Korea-US talks have stalled over disagreements about which side should be the first to make concessions.\nMintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on the Koreas, said Kim\u2019s visit to Beijing \u201cwas one of a few recent signs that progress toward a second US-North Korea summit is getting serious.\n\u201cIt clearly leaves both leaders, but especially Kim, in a stronger position. He can now negotiate with Washington having demonstrated that China supports his approach. And he will probably want to secure another US-North Korea summit even more now to offset the visit to China and show he is an independent actor with options, not a Chinese vassal.\n\u201cThe Trump administration probably wasn\u2019t surprised or annoyed by this visit given that there\u2019s now a clear pattern of Kim Jong-un visiting China at critical moments. But there is a danger in the administration\u2019s tendency to overestimate China\u2019s power over North Korea and assume China influences all of the negative things Pyongyang does.\u201d\nNorth Korea has warned that denuclearisation could be put at risk unless the US eases sanctions, while the US insists the North must first demonstrate its commitment to abandoning nuclear weapons.\nDetails of Kim\u2019s trip to China emerged as the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, predicted that a second summit between Kim and Trump would take place \u201csoon\u201d.\nBut in comments that could irritate Washington, Moon suggested he would push for sanctions exemptions to restore inter-Korean economic cooperation, including the reopening of the Kaesong industrial park. In his New Year\u2019s address, Kim said he was ready to reopen the complex, which Seoul closed in 2016 in response to a North Korean rocket launch.\nMoon said: \u201cMy administration will cooperate with the international community, including the United States, to resolve the remaining issues such as international sanctions as soon as possible.\u201d\nKim\u2019s visit to China \u2013 a permanent member of the UN security council \u2013 is also being seen as part of an effort to win Chinese support for reducing sanctions that were strengthened in response to a string of ballistic missile launches and a nuclear test in 2017.\nKim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea national diplomatic academy in Seoul, said China was unlikely to drop its \u201cfirm\u201d support for international sanctions. Instead, he said, the focus of the Kim-Xi meeting was likely to have been on how China could facilitate economic reforms in North Korea.\nNevertheless, Kim Jong-un had used the meeting \u201cto add to the pressure on Trump [to reduce sanctions] and to use China as back-up,\u201d he added.\n\u201cChina is the only country that will be able to support economic reforms in North Korea once sanctions are lifted,\u201d he said. \u201cKim will need Chinese support before he finally begins denuclearising North Korea. I think he will take some initial measures to denuclearise North Korea, after which the US will reciprocate with initial measures to lift sanctions.\u201d\nSouth Korea\u2019s ambassador to the US, Cho Yoon-je, said Kim\u2019s trip to China was \u201cquite a good sign\u201d that he and Trump would hold a second summit. Trump said at the weekend negotiations were underway on the location of his next meeting.\nSpeaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington on Wednesday, Cho said \u201cthe train is already on the move\u201d. While the timing was unclear, he added: \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it can be stopped or reversed, at least in the near future.\u201d\nLu Chao, director of the Korea Research Center at the Liaoning Academy of Social Science, said the visit \u201cshows the relationship is improving\u201d and that North Korea views ties with Beijing as \u201cone of its most significant diplomatic relationships\u201d.\nUsing North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Lu added: \u201cThe only barrier is the nuclear issue. If the DPRK does not do as it has promised, then the disagreement continues.\u201d",

They dug mini valleys and raised micro hills to make the cuttings and embankments that drove a railway through this gently undulating landscape.\nThe smoke and sparks are long gone from this little branch line out to Bedford, leaving a serene cycle path for easy riders, who can pedal without having to push too hard.\nWe should be grateful for the high causeway that bears us on solid ground above the rough-coated horses grazing the stream-threaded meadows beneath. And we can marvel at the ingenuity and improvisation of those who built a bridge bolted with button-headed rivets to carry us over the River Ivel. How, I wonder, did horses and carts transport the bridge\u2019s iron girders on a roadless route through the sucking soil of marshy clay?\nOn a bike with no lights, I waited until first light before setting off. For me, it was a track towards somewhere, but for territorial birds the line marked a physical boundary. On either side of the great divide, two song thrushes had been beguiled by mild weather over the Christmas break to open their throats. In full voice, they played out a north bank/south bank competition, trading notes instead of blows on slopes that had filled with bushes and trees since the line\u2019s abandonment more than half a century before.\nDays after that holiday visit, I rose off my saddle to see the south bank bird emboldened to hop up from where I had seen him before, a half-concealed perch on an ivy-clad trunk, to lodge among the exposed topmost branches of the same tree. There he sat, the king of the jingle, throwing out phrase after phrase. Like all of his kind, this male song thrush was a sampler, pitching snatches of songs that never developed into full melodies, but with such vigour and volume it was as if nature\u2019s microphone were in his beak. His \u201csing as if it\u2019s spring\u201d exuberance was matched today by three rival birds on both sides of the track, producing not so much a chorus as a collision of voices.",

        "content": "The Well of Loneliness was censored after a campaign by the Sunday Express, but archives show thousands of readers wrote to express thanks for the book\nRadclyffe Hall\u2019s 1928 novel The Well of Loneliness was subjected to a vicious campaign of attack led by the Sunday Express for its depiction of lesbian relationships, eventually being suppressed and censored in the UK as a piece of \u201cobscene libel\u201d. But the author\u2019s own papers, which are set to be digitised, reveal the outpouring of support Hall received from members of the public around the world, who wrote to thank her for creating, in her heroine Stephen Gordon, a character with whom they could identify.\nSeen today as a seminal work of gay literature, The Well of Loneliness tells of the \u201cinvert\u201d Stephen Gordon, who realises from a young age that she is attracted to women, dresses in masculine clothes, and falls in love. Hall, a lesbian herself, wrote it to \u201cput my pen at the service of some of the most misunderstood people in the world\u201d. At its raciest, it goes no further than \u201cshe kissed her full on the lips, as a lover\u201d, with a night of passion described as \u201cthat night they were not divided\u201d. It ends with Stephen\u2019s plea: \u201cGive us also the right to our existence!\u201d\nSunday Express editor James Douglas led a campaign against the novel, writing in his paper: \u201cIn order to prevent the contamination and corruption of English fiction it is the duty of the critic to make it impossible for any other novelist to repeat this outrage. I say deliberately that this novel is not fit to be sold by any bookseller or to be borrowed from any library.\u201d Despite support from writers including Virginia Woolf and EM Forster, it was banned in the UK until 1949, after Hall\u2019s death. But newly revealed papers from the author\u2019s archive, which are set to be digitised by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas alongside those of her partner, the artist Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge, show that the novel was also supported by thousands of readers, who wrote to Hall in outrage at the ban.\n\u201cThe picture you paint of the poor invert should make everyone more charitable \u2026 No one could finish your book, Miss Hall, without donning a sword and shield forever in the cause of inverts,\u201d wrote one reader from the US, where the novel was not withdrawn despite a challenge, a court declaring it not obscene.\n\u201cIt has made me want to live and to go on \u2026 I discovered myself in Paris and I dreaded this thing which I thought abnormal,\u201d wrote another.\nIn the UK, an 18-year-old man told Hall he had \u201cexperienced many of the terrors of the invert\u201d, hailing her \u201ctruly marvellous but searing book\u201d. Others offered to send money to help Hall in an appeal against the judgment, or wrote of how the book changed their perspectives. \u201cAt first it repulsed and disgusted, and then the pathos and beauty of it got me, and if I had it in my power to help those poor souls I would have offered my services,\u201d wrote a London correspondent.\nDr Steven Macnamara, who has researched Hall\u2019s papers, said she received \u201cthousands of letters of support\u201d.\n\u201cThe letters demonstrate the public\u2019s awareness that The Well of Loneliness was not an obscene novel, and that Hall had been unfairly and unjustly treated by the government and the media. Access to these letters, through the future digitalisation project, will enhance the importance and understanding of this groundbreaking novel for Hall\u2019s contemporary readers,\u201d he said.\nIn one letter, a married coal miner in Doncaster wrote that he had \u201cmarvelled at the bigoted outlook of so-called \u2018thinking men\u2019, who are ashamed to let broader minded folk than themselves delve into the great sex problems\u201d. The miner added: \u201cSome day we will wake up, and demand to know ourselves as we profess to know about everything else.\u201d\nThe new project will see more than 38,500 images from Hall and Troubridge\u2019s papers digitised and made available online in January 2021. Alongside Hall\u2019s notebooks and drafts for The Well of Loneliness, the archive also includesdiaries, letters \u2013 including around 650 that Hall wrote between 1934 and 1942 to Evguenia Souline, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9e with whom she had an extended affair \u2013 and evidence gathered by Hall\u2019s American lawyer before her obscenity trial in the US in 1929.\nIn a telegram, physician Dr Logan Clendening writes that \u201cit is incredible to the scientific mind that an honest and sensitive presentation in literary form of a subject familiar and tragic to every physician should be threatened due to the pornographic imagination of a censor.\u201d\nRansom Center director Stephen Enniss said: \u201cThe richness and depth of this material goes well beyond the subsequent censorship and cultural controversies sparked by The Well of Loneliness.\u201d\nJana Funke, senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and author of The World and Other Unpublished Works by Radclyffe Hall, said the archive also includes early drafts of The Well of Loneliness, which are \u201cmore explicit in their depiction of lesbian desire and more affirmative regarding the protagonist\u2019s gender non-conforming identity\u201d. Hall dropped earlier sections from the book \u201carguably to try and make the book less scandalous \u2013 a strategy that obviously failed,\u201d said Funke.\nOne chapter in an early draft, included in Funke\u2019s book, begins with the protagonist having sex with a woman during wartime at the frontline. \u201cThey spoke very little, for the darkness was rent by intolerable noise, and by sudden swift flashes that penetrated even into this darkness between cracks in the war-scarred brickwork,\u201d wrote Hall. \u201cAnd something, perhaps this near presence of death, seemed to quicken their bodies into agonised loving, so that they felt the throb of their bodies in each separate nerve and muscle and fibre, so that they ceased to be two poor atoms, and became one transient imperative being, having reason for neither good nor evil \u2013 the primitive, age-blind life force.\u201d\nFunke said that when people read The Well of Loneliness, knowing that it was banned as obscene in the UK, \u201cthey are often surprised and disappointed to find that there is no explicit sexual content. It was banned simply because it argued that lesbian sexuality and gender non-conformity should be accepted by society.\u201d\nHall and Troubridge, she added, \u201care internationally recognised as LGBTQ pioneers, and it is vitally important that audiences around the globe have access to their papers now and in the future\u201d.\n A photo caption in this article was amended on 10 January 2019 to correctly identify Radclyffe Hall.",

Flat earthers \u2013 who include the rapper B.o.B. and reality television person Tila Tequila \u2013 will be able to enjoy restaurants, swimming pools and perhaps even an artificial surf wave.\nThere\u2019s just one problem for those seeking to celebrate the flatness of the Earth. The navigational systems cruise ships, and other vessels, use rely on the fact that the Earth is not flat: theoretically puncturing the beliefs of the flat Earth crowd.\n\u201cShips navigate based on the principle that the Earth is round,\u201d said Henk Keijer, a former cruise ship captain who sailed all over the globe during a 23-year career.\n\u201cNautical charts are designed with that in mind: that the Earth is round.\u201d\nKeijer, who now works as a forensic marine expert for Robson Forensic, said the existence of GPS, the global positioning system, alone is proof that the Earth is a sphere, not a flat disc. GPS relies on 24 main satellites which orbit the Earth to provide positional and navigational information.\n\u201cThe reason why 24 satellites were used is because on the curvature of the Earth,\u201d Keijer said.\n\u201cA minimum of three satellites are required to determine a position. But someone located on the other side of the Earth would also like to know their position, so they also require a certain number of satellites.\n\u201cHad the Earth been flat, a total of three satellites would have been enough to provide this information to everyone on Earth. But it is not enough, because the Earth is round.\u201d\nWhile there are different theories within the Flat Earth community, the core belief is the Earth is flat. The FEIC claims that after \u201cextensive experimentation, analysis, and research\u201d, its adherents came to believe the Earth is not a sphere.\nA common model offered for the exact topography of the Earth is that it is a large disk, surrounded by \u201can ice wall barrier\u201d \u2013 Antarctica.\nThe Flat Earth Society, which is not connected to the FEIC, has suggested that \u201cthe space agencies of the world\u201d have conspired to fake \u201cspace travel and exploration\u201d.\n\u201cThis likely began during the cold war,\u201d the Flat Earth Society says. \u201cThe USSR and USA were obsessed with beating each other into space to the point that each faked their accomplishments in an attempt to keep pace with the other\u2019s supposed achievements.\u201d\nThe FEIC did not respond to requests for more information on the Flat Earth cruise. The organization could potentially try to staff the cruise ship with a crew which does not think the Earth is round, but Keijer said that would be difficult.\n\u201cI have sailed 2 million miles, give or take,\u201d Keijer said.\n\u201cI have not encountered one sea captain who believes the Earth is flat.\u201d",

        "content": "Tommy Nicol described his indeterminate sentence as \u2018psychological torture\u2019 before he died in 2015\nThe sister of a prisoner who took his own life when being held under a now-abolished sentencing regime has called for urgent action to deal with thousands of inmates still jailed under the widely derided system.\nTommy Nicol was jailed under an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence \u2013 a form of indeterminate sentence that he described as the \u201cpsychological torture of a person who is doing 99 years\u201d.\nHe made the comment in a handwritten formal complaint at Erlestoke prison around five years into his IPP sentence for robbery and about nine months before he killed himself.\nThe horror inflicted by the perceived neverending nature of IPP was acknowledged by the government\u2019s decision to scrap their use in 2011. The scheme was applied far more widely than intended, with some IPP sentences issued to offenders who committed low-level crimes.\nBut despite the use of the sentencing power being scrapped, nearly 2,600 prisoners still remain locked up under the defunct regime, which saw offenders given a minimum jail tariff but no maximum for a range of crimes.\nSince his death in September 2015, his sister Donna Mooney has discovered more about Tommy\u2019s experience in the prison estate than she is sometimes able to bear.\nNow she is calling for the remaining IPP prisoners on minimum tariffs of four years or less to be immediately switched to determinate sentences. She wants to meet with the justice secretary, David Gauke, to discuss what happened to her brother. The proportion of the IPP population who have gone beyond their minimum tariff continues to increase \u2013 89% of IPP prisoners were post-tariff as of 30 September.\n\u201cIn all of this I\u2019m not justifying what he did,\u201d she says at her home in south-west London. \u201cHe did something and there should have been consequences for that but he is still a human being.\u201d\nShe explains that her brother was the eldest of six children \u2013 three boys, three girls \u2013 and struggled with a \u201ctraumatic\u201d childhood.\n\u201cWe had a difficult childhood and I guess consequently he went off the rails a bit,\u201d she says.\nNicol was in and out of young offenders\u2019 institutions and prison from his teenage years \u2013 but Mooney always felt as if his emotional and rehabilitative needs were ignored. Of all the six siblings, Nicol remains the only one who ended up in trouble with the law.\n\u201cHe was very institutionalised,\u201d she says. \u201cOutside of that, he was happy, friendly, a kind person. He would rather have had a family and a job. He just wasn\u2019t able to do that.\u201d\nIn 2009, he committed his most serious offence \u2013 he stole a car from a mechanic\u2019s garage. The owner caught him in the act, a tussle broke out and the man\u2019s arm was injured. Nicol was jailed at St Albans Crown Court in 2009.\n\u201cAt that point he didn\u2019t really know what an IPP was,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cWhen he told me I thought, \u2018it can\u2019t be true\u2019.\u201d\nNicol started his prison sentence at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire. His understanding was that it would benefit his prospects for release to access a therapeutic community, only available in a small number of prisons, and to do this he would need to undergo a psychological assessment. He requested this early on but it never took place.\nIn 2013, his tariff completed, he received his first knock back from the Parole Board for release \u2013 who informed him he should access a therapeutic community. This frustrated him but he persevered and requested a jail transfer. He applied to two therapeutic communities, but was unsuccessful.\nIn June 2014 he was transferred to HMP Coldingley in Surrey where there were no relevant courses for him to complete. While there he filed a formal complaint that he had been transferred to a prison that could not offer him the relevant mental health support.\nIt was in Coldingley where serious difficulties began to emerge, but which Mooney says were ignored. Nicol moved himself into solitary confinement \u2013 known as the care and separation unit (CSU) \u2013 in protest. He spent 48 days alone and went on hunger strike for four days. No mental health support was provided.\nIn November 2014 he was transferred to Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire, where he made another formal complaint in which he labelled IPP sentences \u201cpsychological torture\u201d.\nIn February 2015, a psychological assessment was conducted that concluded he would benefit from accessing a therapeutic community.\nIn June 2015, six years into his sentence, he received another knockback from the Parole Board and was told the next review would be in 2017 \u2013 eight years after he was jailed on a minimum four-year tariff.\nA month later he returned to the CSU where he languished for 80 days. He went on hunger strike for seven days. His behaviour started to become increasingly unusual.\nMooney breaks down in tears as she continues her brother\u2019s story. \u201cThat\u2019s for me where you see it really starting to affect him,\u201d she says.\nHe was transferred once again on 15 September 2015 to HMP The Mount, in Hertfordshire. His behaviour became increasingly erratic. He self-harmed, setting a fire in his cell. He was moved to the CSU in the Mount, where he was observed rocking on his knees, groaning. He wrapped himself in sheets and made a paper plate mask. But no mental health support was provided.\nOn 19 September 2015 he was moved to an unfurnished cell \u2013 the harshest prison environment available \u2013 for 24 hours. A video of guards restraining Nicol as they moved him was recently played at his inquest in front of Mooney and other horrified family members.\nHe was heard chanting and talking to imaginary people while in the cell. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was having this mental health episode, and four guys go in and restrain him.\u201d\nFinally, on Monday 21 September 2015, the governor requested mental health support to see Nicol. The mental health team attempted to access him but were denied due to safety concerns on three occasions. After a seven-hour stint in an unfurnished cell he was returned to the CSU and three hours later was found unresponsive.\nFour days later he was pronounced dead in Watford general hospital. Despite being unresponsive, he had been held in restraints in his hospital bed. His family were not informed until he had died. He was 37.\n\u201cI can just see how much this sentence has impacted him \u2013 it\u2019s made my brother take his life,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cHe had a complete loss of hope.\u201d\nShe also believes had Nicol known he had a fixed release date \u2013 even if it was longer than the period he ultimately spent in jail \u2013 he would still be alive.\nDr Dinesh Maganty, a consultant forensic psychiatrist who gave evidence to the Harris review into deaths in custody, gave evidence at Nicol\u2019s inquest.\nExplaining the issues around the impact of the IPP sentence, he said that one crucial element in any self-inflicted death is loss of hope.\n\u201cI would hope that if I say something it will stop other families having to go through this \u2013 this is traumatising,\u201d Mooney says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the person in prison it affects \u2013 it has affected every single one of us.\u201d\n In the UK the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

        "content": "\u2018The rubber boats are always overloaded and fragile. But at sea, if you don\u2019t take photographs, there will be no evidence\u2019\nI\u2019m employed by SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res to document humanitarian rescue missions in the Mediterranean. But I\u2019m also part of the team of sailor-rescuers \u2013 I received the same training, and learned the same drills and first aid techniques. As a photographer I\u2019m a witness, but there\u2019s always the possibility that I\u2019ll need to put down the camera and be hands-on. It happens pretty often, in fact. For this particular moment on the rescue ship  Aquarius in October 2017, I was able to just chronicle the rescue. In that one day, 588 survivors were brought aboard. The Aquarius can accommodate 600 people but we\u2019ve had to bring 1,000 on before. The migrant boats often leave around the same time because they are all waiting for a window of good weather and a calm sea.\nWhen we spot a boat in distress, we approach it in two small, rigid-hulled inflatable boats filled with lifejackets. If we arrived directly with an enormous ship it could risk damaging the migrants\u2019 boat, or people might start jumping into the water. The priority is always to ensure people will be able to stay afloat if anything happens.\nThe rubber boats \u2013 this one is typical \u2013 tend to contain eight people for every square metre. The boats are very thin and are always overloaded and consequently very fragile. The people in this photo were fleeing Libya and had already spent 10 to 15 hours at sea, but their boat was in relatively good shape and was still completely inflated. The people were dehydrated, but thankfully no one was injured or had fallen overboard.\nThis is one of the few images I have where the rescued people are looking straight at me. I shot it from the vantage point of one of the rescue boats; someone next to me from the rescue team must have been giving instructions about how to get on the Aquarius. The framing is very tight, which heightens the claustrophobia of being on the migrant boat. The shot represents maybe a third of its total length. Several people have told me the reflections in the water remind them of blood or fire. The sea is hostile: when you\u2019ve been on it for several hours, you burn, you dehydrate.\nIn the middle of the sea, you\u2019re isolated. There\u2019s nobody around. If you don\u2019t photograph what\u2019s happening, there will be no evidence of broken boats, of the deaths. But there\u2019s an important ethic to respect: you don\u2019t photograph the faces of the dead or those who drowned. The images have to be informative for the public, and maintain the dignity of the subjects, who are in incredibly vulnerable situations. They have only the clothes on their backs, squeezed against one another on the rubber boats. On board the Aquarius we have discussions, we distribute food, we stay on watch. There are stories that are unbearable to hear, but there are moments that are enriching, too. During my last mission I took a mini printer and printed photos for the survivors. It\u2019s important that they have a record of this passage. It\u2019s a piece of their journey. It bears witness to their experience.\nLater, these survivors disembarked in the south of Italy, in Vibo Valentia, then the Red Cross took over. Maritime law states that we should be able to disembark at the nearest safe port to the rescue, but that has become challenging. On a recent mission, we rescued 58 people, but had to spend 10 days roaming the sea near Malta. Those days idling on the sea at the whim of the wind and the waves were hard, and we aren\u2019t equipped to have so many people living aboard that long.\nSince 2017 the situation has seriously deteriorated. Italy has closed itself off, and other European states are debating who should welcome survivors and when. But there are more migrant boats coming and it\u2019s urgent that we continue the rescue missions. Last year saw more deaths on the Mediterranean than in 2017. Roughly one out of every five people who try to get to Europe in one of these boats dies. That\u2019s enormous. It\u2019s total chaos.

Theoretically, it\u2019s a remake of Intouchables, the French heartwarmer smash from 2011 taken from a true story, starring Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet as a lonely, angry, quadriplegic multimillionaire and the redemptive odd-couple friendship he strikes up with his irreverent ex-con carer, played by Omar Sy. The film suggested a matching caste equivalence in their respective disadvantages: physical and socioeconomic.\nThis version has Bryan Cranston as the wheelchair user, Phillip, a mega-rich business guru and art collector who suffered a catastrophic hang-gliding accident. (His single status is moreover explained by having his wife\u2019s cancer death perfunctorily remembered in flashback.) Kevin Hart plays Dell, the fast-talking guy on parole who somehow gets a job as his live-in \u201clife auxiliary\u201d.\nYou don\u2019t have to have seen the French film to feel that things look rather familiar. With the condescending and cloying link of a white man in trouble and a funny, submissive black man who can\u2019t quite believe his luck in getting to sample all the luxury, this looks like a solemnly gag-free revision of Trading Places or, more to the point, Hart\u2019s own recent broad comedy Get Hard. Hart also, incredibly, gets a miraculous appreciation-of-opera moment stolen from Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.\nAs for Bryan Cranston\u2019s wheelchair user, he seems to be surrounded by very beautiful and intelligent women and we are unsubtly invited to note, in their very profusion, what a huge heterosexual catch he is still supposed to be. Nicole Kidman plays his devoted assistant Yvonne, Golshifteh Farahani is his physical trainer and Julianne Margulies is a woman he goes on a date with \u2013 she\u2019s a librarian.\nThe whole affair is misjudged and sickly sweet.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAmazon\u2019s latest low-cost Alexa-powered smart speaker, the third-generation Echo Dot, looks better, sounds better, but still costs the same budget-friendly \u00a350.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nWhen the second-generation Echo Dot launched in the UK it had very little in the way of competition. Having everything that was good about Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant squeezed into a smaller package half the price of the bigger Echo, it was a no-brainer.\nBut now the Echo Dot has some stiff competition from Google, in the form of the \u00a350 Home Mini and its Assistant, and Amazon\u2019s own second-generation Echo, which is now only \u00a390.\nThe Echo Dot is Amazon\u2019s small, puck-like smart speaker with the firm\u2019s Alexa voice assistant built in. New for the third generation is a softer, more rounded aesthetic with fabric sides. It is also slightly larger in all directions, measuring 99mm in diameter and 43mm tall.\nAt the back is a circular power socket, replacing the microUSB socket of the old Dot, and a standard 3.5mm analogue socket for connecting to a stereo. On top you have the volume buttons, action button and the microphone mute button.\nYou can also use Bluetooth to stream from the Dot to other speakers or from your phone or other device to the Dot to use it as Bluetooth speaker.\nThe updated design is joined by an improved speaker. The sound is fired out from the fabric sides of the new Dot, instead of the plastic top of the old model, projecting sound further into the room making it much better for music.\nThe quality of the speaker has also been upgraded. It won\u2019t beat larger speakers, but for the money it sounds pretty good, edging out Google\u2019s Home Mini.\nThe mids are punchy, the highs relatively crisp and while there\u2019s no real bass to speak of, the new Dot sounds relatively rounded for a small speaker.\nFeed it guitars and vocals from something like the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you\u2019re greeted with a warm, inviting tone. Classical tracks such as Jupiter from Holst\u2019s the Planets sound fairly rounded too. The Dot struggles with bass-driven electronica, but coped better than expected with Dr Dre\u2019s Still D.R.E. despite its pumping bassline.\nThe Dot can also get pretty loud, although not quite as loud as Google\u2019s Home Mini, and the audio starts to distort in high-energy tracks at maximum volume.\nWith smart speakers, the hardware you buy is only half the story: they live or die by the capability of the voice assistant within them.\nThe Dot\u2019s Alexa performance is first rate, with its four-microphone array being able to hear you over things like the cooker hood going full pelt in the kitchen or when playing music at maximum volume even if you do have to shout a bit. Alexa also sounds good through the Dot\u2019s speakers.\nBut where Alexa was the only game in town, it\u2019s now a two-horse race between Alexa and Google Assistant. For most things Alexa and Assistant are on a level playing field, particularly if you\u2019re not entirely integrated into Google\u2019s ecosystem already.\nSmart home control, music playback, podcasts, news briefings, playing radio stations, setting multiple alarms, timers and various other little bits like that all work great.\nAlexa has a lot of third-party \u201cskills\u201d (apps), including those from news publishers such as the Guardian, games such as Escape the Room, utilities such as National Rail app and silly things such Star Trek \u2013 Red Alert, so you can pretend you\u2019re on the starship Enterprise.\nYou can change Alexa\u2019s wake word too, which is the word it listens out for when dormant before activating. \u201cAlexa\u201d is the default, but options include Echo, Computer or Amazon - helpful if you have anyone called Alex in your house and want to avoid accidental activations of either the Dot or the human.\nWhere Google\u2019s Assistant has the edge is in interpreting speech when you mess up your questions, or when you issue multiple commands at once such as \u201cturn off the Christmas tree and the living room lights\u201d. Google can also answer a greater range of questions than Alexa.\nAlexa can finally recognise different voice profiles for different users in one home in the UK as of November\nThe blue light ring around the top is easy to see from across the room\nYou can buy things on Amazon via voice if you want, but it can be a laborious process unless you know the precise name of the item and variant. I turned it off.\nThe Amazon Echo Dot (third generation) is available in black, grey or white costing \u00a349.99, although supply constraints mean you might need to shop around.\nThis article includes content provided by Skimlinks.

It\u2019s more attractive, sounds better, hears you just as well, still has a 3.5mm socket and Bluetooth audio in and out.\nIt isn\u2019t a patch on the larger Echo speakers, which are almost twice the price, but just about beats its closest rival, the Google Home Mini, on sound and connectivity.\nAt \u00a350, or frequently \u00a330 on deals, you get a lot of smart speaker for the money with the Echo Dot. But where the original Echo Dot was a no-brainer, the decision now comes down to whether you want Alexa or Google Assistant in your tiny smart speaker, which is a much tougher call to make.\nPros: can always hear you, small but loud enough, great device support, clear when muted, activity can been seen from across the room, Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio socket\nCons: music distorts at max volume, no real bass, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant\nAmazon Echo second-generation review: smaller, cheaper and better\nGoogle Home review: the smart speaker that answers almost any question\nGoogle Home Mini review: a brilliant little \u00a350 voice assistant speaker",

Pet food is also estimated to be responsible for a quarter of the environmental impacts of meat production in terms of use of land, water, fossil fuels, phosphates and pesticides.\nInsects provide a relatively high 40% of the protein in the new product from startup Yora. They are dried and ground with oats, potato and \u201cnatural botanicals\u201d. The current version comes in the form of dried pellets, although Yora says it hopes to launch a \u201cwet\u201d version later in the year.\nEnvironmental experts have long recommended insects as a relatively sustainable food source that could help end world hunger and reduce the damaging environmental impact of meat production. Insects are also very nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids, and are easy for animals to digest.\n\u201cAnimals and humans have been eating insects since the dawn of time\u201d said Yora founder Tom Neish. \u201cWe have trialled 29 recipes to find the perfect combination of great tasting ingredients and are very proud of the end result. Yora enables dog owners to take the lead in giving their dog a nutritious, tasty food while having a positive impact on the environment.\u201d\nIn November, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets \u2013 barbecued crickets sold as snacks in small bags. In total, more than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations.\nThe insects in Yora\u2019s dog food are the larvae of black soldier flies (Hermetia illucens) which are reared by protein nutrient company Protix in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. They can turn vegetation that would otherwise be wasted into body mass quickly and sustainably. Other dog foods made from bugs have been launched in the USA and Germany, but with a lower insect content.",

But, as an industry, we are growing very tired of being \u2018the whipping boy\u2019 for all the problems that are being brought on by this crippling drought.\n\u201cThe recent fish deaths in the Barwon-Darling river system at Menindee was a devastating sight. However, it is wrong to blame cotton growers for this incident.\u201d\nThe immediate cause of the mass fish kill is believed to be a sudden drop in temperature that killed algal blooms in the water, depleting it of oxygen and causing fish to die.\nBut Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW, said it was a disaster that had been many years in the making because too much water had been diverted from the system for agriculture.\n\u201cDroughts would have contributed to the blue green algae outbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the river droughts are happening more often and they\u2019re more intense as a result of the irrigation industry in the Darling diverting water from the river over the last 10 to 20 years.\u201d\nHe said the problem could be traced back to management of water by state and federal levels of government and both of the major parties.\nThe NSW Labor leader, Michael Daley, called on Thursday for the Berejiklian government to establish a special commission of inquiry into the state\u2019s water management.\n\u201cThe scale of this disaster is extraordinary and unprecedented,\u201d the opposition leader said in a statement. \u201cThe people of NSW have watched for 18 months as water theft scandals, water mismanagement and now ecological disasters have rocked far west rivers.\u201d\nThe NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, sought to assure residents of the state\u2019s far west the government was working to find a solution.\nHer comments come a day after the minister for primary industries and water, Niall Blair, was criticised for bypassing a large gathering of people waiting to ask him questions on a visit to Menindee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working through it as fast as we can to see what solutions we can contribute towards and I commend him [Blair] for being on the ground,\u201d she said.\nBlair said this week he had met with residents in Menindee but bypassed the gathering on the town\u2019s main boat ramp on security advice.",

        "content": "Car-free days, filtered permeability and lower speed limits are just some of the ways that cities around the world are trying to encourage cycling\nCycling in London is on the rise \u2013 up 56% on some routes since 2014. The construction a few years ago of a number of protected cycle lanes in the city centre undoubtedly helped drive this change, but there are additional ways to boost the number of people on bikes. We explore 10 ideas below \u2013 please contribute yours in the comments section.\nIf the benefits of cycling \u2013 both economic and environmental \u2013 outweigh the cost of bikes overall, then why not simply give bikes away?\nLike most cycling initiatives, this idea can be traced to the Netherlands, where the anarchist group Provo distributed 10,000 white bikes to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s.\nThese were free for everyone to use, on the basis that \u201cper kilometre [one bike] would cost the municipality only 10% of what it contributed to public transport per person per kilometre\u201d. The authorities hadn\u2019t made the same calculations, however, and the white bikes were quickly removed \u2013 or were stolen.\nVariations have since cropped up round the world. In Adelaide, free daily hire bikes are available to visitors and residents as part of the Australian city\u2019s Smart Move strategy. Birmingham in the UK ran a scheme last year where residents of poorer postcodes could apply for a free bike if they agreed to ride it. Meanwhile, in Gothenburg, Sweden, the government is giving free bikes to commuters who promise to drive less.\nIn 1977, Groningen \u2013 a small city in the northern Netherlands \u2013 underwent a rapid transformation. Provisional signs and barriers were covertly erected to direct cars out of the city centre until they were gradually, over several months, confined to areas outside it.\nBy selectively reducing the number of city streets available to vehicles, journeys that were once relatively easy by car became arduous and convoluted. Residents chose to cycle instead of drive, even when heading to a big furniture and homewares store such as Ikea \u2013 whose specially designed cargo bikes are popular with locals.\nThe idea, later termed \u201cfiltered permeability\u201d by transport planning professor Steve Melia, applied in a single stroke what he calls the three most important principles for increasing urban cycling: separation from motor traffic, consistent design, and making bike journeys quicker and more convenient than car journeys.\nExcluding cars entirely isn\u2019t always practical \u2013 and can make life difficult for disabled people, as well as preventing access for ambulances, fire services and delivery lorries.\nSlowing cars down makes city centres more hospitable to cyclists \u2013 but does putting up 20mph or 30kph speed signs actually have an effect?\nEvidence from Portsmouth (where the speed limit was reduced from 30mph to 20mph on around 94% of roads) and Bristol (where 20mph was introduced on several main routes) suggests that 20mph zones increase both perceptions of road safety, and actual road safety \u2013 and lead to more people walking and cycling.\nBut a November report from the Department for Transport concluded that, over 12 schemes across Britain, 20mph zones have achieved on average a less than 1mph reduction in median speed.\nUrban designer and transport planner John Dales suggests that, regardless of signposting, \u201cdesigning the street, as a whole, to achieve the desired speed is the key thing\u201d. The more successful low-speed areas include physical designs which make it natural for drivers to go slower. These include humps, speed tables, rough surfaces, tight corners and carriageway narrowing lanes.\nResidents choosing to cycle instead of drive in Groningen, the Netherlands. Photograph: Chromorange/Alexander Bernhard/Alamy\nWhat if legislation alone could encourage more people to cycle?\nIn the Netherlands, liability is automatically placed with the more powerful road user, unless it can be proven they were not at fault. The law is designed to protect vulnerable road users from financial damage caused by drivers of motorised vehicles. Unlike in the UK, a motorist who hits a cyclist in the Netherlands must prove they were doing everything they could to avoid contact \u2013 otherwise they will be liable for damages.\nSupporters say stacking the law in this way would encourage people to drive more carefully.\nFor many people the real roadblock to cycling in cities is fear. According to statistics from the UK Department for Transport, almost half of all adults strongly agree that \u201cthe idea of cycling on busy roads [is frightening]\u201d.\nOne way to get around this could be by teaching drivers to use the \u201cDutch reach\u201d, a term actually coined by an American cyclist Michael Charney. By opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle, the driver is forced to turn their body towards the door, becoming more likely to catch sight of approaching cyclists in their peripheral vision.\nOne study in Chicago found that about one-in-five bicycle accidents involve car doors, with many happening as cyclists swerve to avoid collision. Even in Vancouver \u2013 another city with a notable cycle lane network \u2013 \u201cdooring\u201d is the most common cause of injury for cyclists colliding with cars.\nIn the UK, where \u201cdooring\u201d is responsible for an average of 700 injuries and two deaths every year, the government announced in October that Dutch reach will be added to the highway code. Traffic safety organisations like the AAA will begin teaching it to US drivers from January.\nThe \u2018Dutch reach\u2019 \u2013 opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle \u2013 makes drivers becoming more likely to spot approaching cyclists. Photograph: Hympi/Alamy\nAccording to American professor Donald Shoup, car driving is subsidised greatly by the general public. When parking spaces are provided free of charge to the motorist, their cost is absorbed into the cost of other things \u2013 be that supermarket prices, company fees, or taxes.\nIn his ground-breaking 2005 book The High Cost of Free Parking \u2013 and his latest tome, Parking and the City, published this year \u2013 Shoup argues that these economic subsidies pull people into cars, to the cost of everyone else.\nIn California, Shoup managed to get a new state law requiring employers who provide subsidised parking for their employees to also offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space \u2013 so taking the fringe benefit of free parking and transforming it into an incentive for cycling.\nAlthough, so far only one workplace has actually implemented the \u201cparking cash out\u201d. At the Sony studio in Santa Monica, cyclist Gary Kavanagh discovered this idea independently of Shoup, and pitched it to his HR department only to find it was unenforced state law. Soon enough, his cycle commuting made him $120 richer each month. He chronicled the experience in his blog.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for this kind of incentive to start influencing behaviour,\u201d he writes. \u201cSome part-time bike commuters who would occasionally drive became full-time bike commuters. Some people who never rode bikes before suddenly embraced it full swing, and would come to my desk to ask bicycle questions.\u201d\nCan banning cars from part of a city for just for one day help lead to long-term change? Supporters say it gives people a taste of what the city could be like in a less car-dominated future.\nMany think that car-free Sundays in the Netherlands in the 1970s were pivotal to the country\u2019s transformation in the following decades. Since then cities around the world have tried their own version, with congested Asian cities such as Chengdu and Jakarta even roping off a few streets.\nParis has been leading the way in Europe, with the almost five-mile distance between the Arc de Triomphe and the Place de la Nation closed to car traffic once a year, which is soon to be increased to once a month.\nLondon does not have a large-scale car-free day but one Sunday in September the city\u2019s boroughs agree to the closure of 50 individual streets. The London car-free day campaign is pushing mayor Sadiq Khan for more.\nA car-free day in Jakarta, 2012. Photograph: Beawiharta/Reuters\nIn a new twist on park and ride, some cities \u2013 such as Oxford, York and Cambridge \u2013 are offering park and pedal schemes which provide free parking for vehicles outside the city as an incentive to hop on a bike and cycle into the centre.\nThere are two of these \u201cbicycle interchanges\u201d a mile outside Oxford, where cyclists can leave bikes at Redbridge or Seacourt park before catching a bus, or park their car at the site and ride into the city centre.\nIn Seville, the Bus&Bici scheme entitles resident commuters to free bike rental for the last leg of their journey \u2013 as long as they return it by midnight.\nSome countries operate cycle-to-work schemes \u2013 with tax exemptions on bike purchases \u2013 but this can be taken to the next level by directly paying people to get on their bikes.\nGovernments in several European states have experimented with the idea. The Netherlands trialled a scheme in 2018 allowing companies to pay employees 19 cents for every kilometre they cycle to and from work. Congested Milan is also contemplating a similar programme and, on a smaller scale, one company in Christchurch, New Zealand, pays employees an extra $5 a day if they cycle to and from work.\nPaying people to cycle could even be profitable for a city. Elly Blue\u2019s book Bikenomics explores the economic benefits of cycling and finds that cities benefit from reduced congestion, while businesses benefit from reduced sick leave and improved employee satisfaction.\nOne trial in France, though, showed that a monetary incentive only attracted a certain type of commuter \u2013 with most of the rise in cycle commuting coming not from former drivers, but from dissolved carpooling arrangements.\nStudies have shown that injuries to pedestrians increased when seatbelt laws were introduced in Australia in the early 1970s. The argument goes that as drivers\u2019 sense of safety grew, they became more likely to take risks, and subconsciously drove a little faster or a bit more recklessly. While the legislation had made those inside the cars safer, it had shifted the risk on to other road users \u2013 particularly cyclists and pedestrians.\nAmerican economist Gordon Tullock proposed one novel way of getting around this. He suggested that more lives would be saved if the government ordered sharp spikes to be installed on all steering wheels, leaving drivers perpetually poised on the edge of serious injury.\nHis idea was built on by several others, including economist Sandy Ikeda, who suggested that the best possible safety measure would be to \u201cban brakes on cars\u201d.\nBut both were proposed strictly as a thought experiment \u2026\nWhat other ways can help promote urban cycling?

        "content": "It was the year that brought us a feast of multiplex and arthouse pleasures and two decades on, its impact can still be felt in Hollywood\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the future,\u201d shrugged Neo in 1999\u2019s The Matrix. \u201cI came here to tell you how it\u2019s going to begin.\u201d With him, on-screen and off, as The Matrix plunged audiences into the future of cinema, which 20 years later, looks like the Wachowskis\u2019 wildest dreams: 1s and 0s everywhere and Keanu Reeves still kicking ass.\nThe Matrix. Magnolia. Being John Malkovich. Fight Club. The Blair Witch Project. The Sixth Sense. Office Space. Man on the Moon. The Talented Mr. Ripley. Boys Don\u2019t Cry. Three Kings. Toy Story 2. The Iron Giant. Eyes Wide Shut. Cruel Intentions. Election. American Pie. Notting Hill and Runaway Bride. 1999 might be the greatest year of modern cinema. I think so. If you aren\u2019t nutty about two-thirds of these films, do you even like movies?\nWhat\u2019s certain, however, is that 1999 is the most pivotal year of modern cinema \u2013 the moment that Hollywood anointed the chosen ones who would become the heroes of the new millennium, from David Fincher to Spike Jonze to an ingenue named Angelina Jolie, who introduced herself to the public by winning best supporting actress for playing a sociopathic mental patient. Girl, Interrupted wasn\u2019t Jolie\u2019s first film. But it was the movie that engraved her on the A-list, a pattern that\u2019s also true for Hillary Swank in Boys Don\u2019t Cry, Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley, Reese Witherspoon in Election, Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You, and Russell Crowe in The Insider.\nWhat explains 1999\u2019s extraordinary films? DVD sales began in 1997 and flooded studios with extra cash, especially in those first years as home viewers built their collection. Studios invested the windfall in a generation of upstart directors, predicting that audiences would buy a good film twice: once in the theater, and again for their shelf.\nSuddenly, the geniuses who\u2019d been discovered during Sundance\u2019s 90s indie wave were entrusted with millions in play-cash plus marketing muscle. It was a creative renaissance. Directors seized the chance to get weird. Paul Thomas Anderson scored $37m to assemble the lyrical montage Magnolia. David O Russell shouldered $47m to satirize the Gulf war. Even Spike Jonze, a music video director with zero film credits to his name, secured $13m to transport audiences to a multiverse of John Malkoviches.\nThe risk paid off. These up-and-coming directors became major 21st-century voices. Still, part of the reason Anderson, Russell and Jonze are still the kings of the kooks is that today\u2019s directors haven\u2019t been given the same golden ticket. The talent exists; the cash doesn\u2019t. Ambitious mid-priced films went extinct when the DVD empire began to crumble in 2008. Instead of betting on auteurs, studios put their chips on big screen superheroes. Break out at this year\u2019s Sundance, and instead of being handed the freedom to dream, you\u2019ll be given the keys to a franchise \u2013 and a conference table of producers as chaperones. Or you\u2019ll stay small and scrappy forever, cranking out a terrific body of work that struggles to be seen amid the crush of streaming media competing for the audience\u2019s attention at a couple bucks a pop, or flat-out free.\nMuch has changed. Twenty years ago, two big-budget Julia Roberts romantic comedies atop the box office chart was a given. Now, both the genre and the star have been squired to streaming. Raunchy teenage comedies like American Pie are, like, totally awkward in an era where dating and sex are on the decline, and raunchy teenage dramas like Cruel Intentions are cloistered on TV to be recast as Riverdale characters who audiences can still safely see as cartoons.\nSex is out, horror is in. And for that, we can thank 1999, too, as The Blair Witch Project launched a mania for mirco-budget nightmares that refuses to crawl back under the bed. The Blair Witch Project (which still holds up fabulously) begat Paranormal Activity which begat Blumhouse Pictures who begat everything from The Purge to Get Out to Insidious to Sinister. Add all four of their budgets together, and they still cost less than Being John Malkovich \u2013 even without inflation. As for M Night Shyamalan, hyped as \u201cThe Next Spielberg\u201d on the cover of Newsweek after The Sixth Sense, he\u2019s finally accepted the Spielberg\u2019s populist template never fit an egotist who prefers to provoke. He\u2019s also found happiness in low-budget thrills like The Visit, Split and the upcoming Glass (all three produced, of course, by Blumhouse).\nProbe the films of 1999 and a suspicion slithers in that we\u2019re stuck in The Matrix ourselves. The near past is repeating like a programming glitch, or, say, an endless parade of Malcovi. There\u2019s deja vu remakes of Tarzan and The Mummy and Pok\u00e9mon and Galaxy Quest and the just-announced Toy Story 4. The Star Wars universe continues to propel the box office, as it\u2019s done since The Phantom Menace. Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst\u2019s comedy Dick about two teen girls who bring down Nixon\u2019s corrupt administration makes for an apropos rewatch, as does Alexander Payne\u2019s black comedy Election, in which a high-achieving blonde female candidate hamstrung by sexism and fraud loses her campaign to a dummy who never seriously intended to win. And if the Oscars mimic this year\u2019s Golden Globes, Green Book winning best picture will be cringeworthy as American Beauty beating a field of worthier contenders in 1999. At least Kevin Spacey won\u2019t be in attendance.\nBut we\u2019re also feeling a deeper connection to 1999, one that vibrates in our wiring. The Y2K panic triggered film-makers to think pessimistically about the future of human survival. The Wachowskis assumed we were toast. Kevin Smith\u2019s Dogma and the Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick End of Days embraced the apocalypse. And David Fincher\u2019s Fight Club and Sam Mendes\u2019s American Beauty feared that mankind had become too weak and materialistic to survive the millennium.\nWhat\u2019s scary about today \u2013 a time in which our nerves are again quivering with anxieties about capitalism, despotism and an all-but-inevitable environmental catastrophe \u2013 is that we\u2019ve now been shaped by those films\u2019 misanthropy. Not just the mens rights activists who\u2019ve adopted The Matrix\u2019s red pill/blue pill analogy as their own twisted \u201ctruth\u201d or the Twitter trolls incubated on the internet who idolize Fight Club\u2019s Tyler Durden. As for the solution, Fincher suggested boxing and domestic terrorism. Mendes touted weightlifting, crushing on underage girls, and, ultimately, suicide.\nIn 1999, our heroes didn\u2019t win. They failed, they disappeared, they died, they blew up their world. And they left a residue of cynicism we\u2019re still scraping off, from our political apathy to the studios\u2019 resentment that their DVD cash cow dropped dead. \u201cThe future is our world, Morpheus,\u201d gloated The Matrix\u2019s Agent Smith. He was right. Yet, we can change our tomorrow.",

        "content": "The comedian has now declared himself \u2018over it\u2019 when it comes to discussions about being rehired at Oscars host, saying he has \u2018nothing to prove\u2019\nAt the end of last week, the actor and comedian who stepped down from hosting this year\u2019s Oscars in the wake of a controversy over homophobia, said he was \u201cevaluating\u201d his position in terms of a return to the role. On Wednesday, Hart appeared to have come to a decision: that he would not be open to being rehired by the Academy \u2013 at least, not this year.\nWhen are the Oscars?\nThe 91st Academy awards take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.\nWho decides on the Oscars?\nThe Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.\n\nHow many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?\nThere are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).\nEach of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.\u00a0\nWhat do Oscar winners win?\nThe Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:\u00a0it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.\u00a0\nAppearing on breakfast TV show Good Morning America, Hart said: \u201cI am done with it. It gets no more energy. For the last time, I am done addressing this. There is no more conversation about it. I\u2019m done with it, I am over it.\u201d\nQuestioned about how he had changed in the past eight years, since some of his more objectionable utterances, Hart said he was \u201cover\u201d discussing old tweets.\n\u201cI have explained how I evolved. I\u2019m not saying how I\u2019ve changed anymore. I\u2019m not saying what I\u2019ve done and what the new me is. I\u2019m giving no more explanation.\u201d\nHart had been thought to have been reinstalled as MC for next month\u2019s ceremony following a remarkable interview on Ellen, which surfaced on Friday. In this, both Hart and interviewer Ellen DeGeneres concurred that the best way for Hart to \u201ctake a stand against the trolls\u201d who had brought his homophobic tweets to light was to return to host the ceremony.\nBut the interview met with a mixed reception on social media, with many declaring that they felt betrayed by DeGeneres for dismissing their concerns over Hart as simple mischief making. In the interview, Hart declined to apologise again but reiterated his feeling that the episode was a direct attempt to bring down his career.\nIt was \u201ca malicious attack on my character \u2026 an attack to end me\u201d, he said. \u201cThis was to destroy me, to end all partnerships, all brand relationships, all investment opportunities, studio relationships, my production company and the people that work underneath me.\u201d\nAny failure to accept his contrition, said Hart on Good Morning America, was not his fault.\nThis article includes content hosted on abc7chicago.com.

I shouldn\u2019t have to prove who I am \u2026 what more do you want from me? You want blood? You want my arms?\u201d\nHart\u2019s main reason for not resuming his post, he said, was because of the lack of time now available to prepare. Although the ceremony is still some six weeks away, Hart said promotional commitments for new film The Upside meant he would only have a fortnight to devote to the Academy Awards.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do it this year, it\u2019s not going to happen, in the future if it does it does but it\u2019s not the conversation of today.\u201d\nThe Upside is a remake of French hit drama Intouchables, about a paraplegic billionaire (in this case played by Bryan Cranston) and his unlikely new carer (played by Hart). In his review, Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw calls it \u201chorrific\u201d.",

Organise said it had sent about 100 anonymised reports of alleged harassment to the Ted Baker board.\nNews of the claims wiped \u00a3116m off the value of the company on fears that Kelvin would leave. The shares rose 13% on Wednesday to \u00a318.27, taking them near the level at which they were trading before the allegations emerged.\nTed Baker\u2019s board of directors appointed the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills to carry out an independent investigation into the allegations.

        "content": "Former prison governor says UK jails have become \u2018incubators\u2019 of extremism\nA former prison governor who led an official review into Islamist extremism in prisons has said jails in the UK have become \u201cincubators\u201d of radical behaviour, and repeated calls for the most subversive offenders to be separated from other inmates.\nIan Acheson, who led the independent government review of Islamist extremism in prisons and probation in 2016, said the high number of lower-tariff extremist offenders entering squalid, overcrowded jails, combined with a low chance of them receiving treatment for their behaviour, were behind the worsening problem.\nHe called for the \u201cenlightened separation of extremist ideologues\u201d in prison, but acknowledged it was a \u201ccontroversial\u201d recommendation.\nAcheson, writing in an essay published by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, said: \u201cIn 2018, 41% of convictions for terrorism-related offences were of sentences of four years or less. In particular, these lower-tariff prisoners enter a penal system severely disordered by overcrowding, squalor and insufficient staff.\n\u201cThe prospect of them receiving treatment for their offending behaviour in this environment pales beside the pragmatic attraction of safety in religious or ideological groups that provide security, kudos and structure.\n\u201cIn this respect, prisons in the UK, in particular in England and Wales, have become incubators of extremism.\n\u201cPolicymakers can and must at least remove those most able to capitalise on this chaos by spreading the message of violent extremism. Individuals who pose a threat must not be allowed to weaponise the grievances of those in search of meaning and excitement.\u201d\nAcheson\u2019s review concluded the threat posed by ideologues with relatively free access in prison to radicalise the next generation of offenders was so great that only incapacitating them would work.\n\u201cEnlightened separation of extremist ideologues in prison and community-based reintegration of offenders on release are new, more agile ways of dealing with this threat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe cannot speak to dead terrorists. We can speak for dead victims. They demand that policymakers take risks to ensure that the people who wish to harm us through a corrupt ideology are engaged, not shunned.\n\u201cThis should happen not because states are weak, but because they are confident the strength of their values will ultimately prevail.\u201d\nThe number of extremist prisoners is relatively low compared with the wider prison population, but Acheson argued their impact was potentially lethal.\nThe Ministry of Justice previously said it believed about 700 prisoners were a risk due to their extremist views. It is understood the figure was an overall estimate of all inmates linked to any form of extremism, including Islamist or far-right ideologies.\nAs of 30 September 2018, there were 224 people in custody in Britain for terrorism-related offences, an increase of 5% on the previous year.\nAcheson said: \u201cWhile the numbers of convicted terrorists remain relatively small in a prison population of around 83,000, the lethal risk radicalised prisoners represent to national security in and outside prisons means policymakers cannot be complacent.\u201d\nPolice and security services have been dealing with a surge in the number of convicted terrorists released from prison. More than 40% of the sentences for terrorism offences over a 10-year period would have been served by the end of 2018, Guardian analysis showed. More than 80 of the 193 sentences for terrorism offences between 2007 and 2016 will have run out by the end of this year.\nAmong those recently released from prison was Anjem Choudary, the hate preacher and leader of the banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun, which inspired a number of Britons to join Isis.\nThe former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, in the foreword to the collection of essays from Acheson and seven other experts on counter-extremism, said: \u201cExtremism based on a perversion of the religion of Islam \u2013 the turning of religious belief into a totalitarian political ideology \u2013 remains the most potent global security threat.\n\u201cSecurity measures are of course necessary. They are also costly. Countries spend billions of dollars to protect themselves against terrorist acts.\n\u201cBut such measures can only ever contain the problem. To eliminate it, we must eliminate the thinking which draws people to the misguided, dangerous mindset that in carrying out these horrific actions, they\u2019re somehow carrying out the will of God.\u201d",

        "content": "Cinematographers can have as much influence over a film as a director. But will prestige TV and declining ticket sales at cinemas put their craft at risk?\nCinematography is one of the most mysterious aspects of film-making. The American Society of Cinematographers turned 100 this month and, though last year\u2019s Oscar for the category drew attention after the first nomination for a female cinematographer, and Twitter users reguarly share examples of \u201cOne Perfect Shot\u201d, the art of \u201cpainting with light\u201d is little understood.\nCinematographers are responsible for photographing films, but in practice their job is more complex. The skill of the cinematographer, or director of photography, is to combine visual artistry with technical knowledge and a certain amount of people management. \u201cMaybe as many as 80 people on a movie come under your direct command,\u201d says Bill Butler, the Oscar-nominated cinematographer who worked on classics including Jaws and One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. \u201cNext to the director, it\u2019s the cinematographer who is really in charge of everything, from the costume you wear to the makeup. You do a lot more than just take meter readings.\u201d\nThe ASC was established to formalise the role of and distinguish cinematographers from camera operators, but it had more to do with practicalities and problem solving. In the silent film era, movie cameras were generally heavy hand-cranked machines, and the centre of gravity of the US film industry was shifting from the east coast to the west. The technology and the medium were new, so camera operators everywhere faced common difficulties, such as annoying white streaks on footage, caused by static electricity. The east-coast based Cinema Camera Club, formed by a team of Edison\u2019s camera operators, and the Static Club of America, based in Los Angeles and led by Universal\u2019s Harry H Harris, collaborated on solutions to these issues, pooling their wisdom. Soon enough, Edison cinematographer Phil Rosen suggested a national organisation to his Hollywood colleague Charles Rosher.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about making pretty pictures,\u201d says Mandy Walker, whose CV includes Hidden Figures, Australia and the forthcoming Mulan. \u201cThe most important part of my job is helping the director tell a story with the images of the film and camera and lighting and lenses. The decisions we make are the most important.\u201d\nButler agrees: \u201cOne of the things that is important is your ability to understand the truth in the film you\u2019re making. Where should you put the camera? How should your camera look at this story? If you do it wrong, then you interrupt the truth you\u2019re trying to get to.\u201d\nIn many ways, the job has changed beyond recognition in the last century. By the time the ASC was founded in 1919, to keep up with the demand for movies, films were increasingly being shot under artificial lights in studios rather than outside in the sunlight. Camera operators had to become cinematographers, or directors of photography, manipulating various different lights and lenses to create specific effects. As the job became more technical and with more opportunities for creative expression, still photographers such as Charles Rosher entered the movies. \u201cThere was a stage when you had two directors on set, a director of actors and the director of photography,\u201d says McDonough. \u201cEventually the actors became pre-eminent, so the director of actors became pre-eminent.\u201d\nThrough the 1920s, much cinematographic flair, especially in Hollywood, was focused on making the stars look more beautiful. This was the birth of the three-point lighting system with a key, a fill and a backlight to add a glamorous effect to stars\u2019 faces, often accompanied by a generous amount of soft focus. Cinematographers were also widely expected to compose each shot, and the growing use of camera movement gave them more seniority: they would need to employ a camera operator and focus puller, too.\nMore challenges and innovations were to come. By the 1940s and 50s, cinematographers were more regularly asked to light for Technicolor (although using crisp enough light that films would still look good on TV, in black-and-white) and create widescreen compositions. In the 60s, the use of handheld cameras and \u201csoft light\u201d (that is, bouncing light off reflective surfaces around a space rather than using direct sources), changed the game again. In the 1970s, Garrett Brown invented the Steadicam, removing the need for expensive dolly tracks, and allowing for a new range of faster, more fluid camera movements.\nThat\u2019s around the time that Butler started to work in cinema, after years spent on live TV. He brought some techniques from television and from European cinema to Hollywood, including bounce lighting and the extensive use of handheld photography in Jaws. \u201cI was original in my style mainly because of my background in television. It very much affected what I did in film and, when things were changing from the old, old style of cinematography, all the rules started to get broken.\u201d\nIn the 21st century, the cinematographer\u2019s remit is only expanding. For Walker, there are more departments to consult with than ever and the job extends before and after the shoot, especially with films that involve a lot of special effects. \u201cCollaboration very early in pre-production is important so that the director knows that the cinematography and the VFX are working together.\u201d Walker is also involved in post-production.\nA sense of cinematographic history can still come in useful. David Mullen, cinematographer for film and TV projects including The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and Jennifer\u2019s Body has used historical techniques with modern lights and cameras to create a vintage Technicolor look. \u201cI loved working on The Love Witch because I was able to recreate a lot of the lighting from the 50s and 60s,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key to making it feel authentic was to put myself in the mindset of someone working back then and not try to apply any modern sensibility to the lighting.\u201d\nWith the industry transitioning rapidly from film to digital and VR movies possibly spelling the end of the \u201cone perfect shot\u201d, what do cinematographers expect from the next 100 years? Mullen expresses some concern about \u201cthe end of cinema\u201d, with declining ticket sales. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether fewer and fewer people want to see a movie in a theatre. And then we won\u2019t have movie theatres any more. I hate to see that go, because viewing a movie on the big screen is a unique experience. It\u2019s not the same as watching at home, even with a big television set.\u201d\nWalker is more excited: \u201cThere will be more and more advances in the technology and the way people view films. I was reading that because of Netflix, people are going to cinema more because it has reinvigorated their film watching.\u201d Although she shot Hidden Figures on film, Walker is enthusiastic about digital technology and recently shot a VR movie: \u201cIt\u2019s broadening the art of cinema.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be amazing tools that we\u2019ll be using to gather images,\u201d adds McDonough. \u201cBut I hope there\u2019s still the human behind that making the final emotional decision about what it means and what to do with it.\u201d\n\u201cDigital does not really change what the cinematographer does. That doesn\u2019t change, and won\u2019t change in the future,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThe future will still depend upon sense of composition and truth as the cinematographer sees it. That will not change. You still need somebody in there that understands the composition and the truth in what he\u2019s doing.\u201d",

        "content": "In the wake of US v Booker, which mandated sentence guidelines, 25 of the 30 cities studied saw jail time spreads increase\nThe length of jail time defendants in the United States receive increasingly depends on the judge hearing their case, a new report from the US Sentencing Commission revealed.\nComparing more than 140,000 cases over 13 years across 30 US cities, the study found that within the same city the length of a defendant\u2019s sentence could swing by as much as 63% depending on the federal judge.\nThe growing discrepancy follows the supreme court\u2019s landmark ruling in US v Booker, which struck down laws that mandated federal district judges to impose sentences within a range of preset guidelines.\nThat 2005 decision marked a \u201csea change\u201d in federal sentencing, Philadelphia-area defense attorney Dennis Cogan told the Guardian.\nPhiladelphia, where Cogan practices, was the city with the largest discrepancy between sentences among judges at 63%. The spread was also high in major jurisdictions like Manhattan (59%) and Chicago (50%). Of the 30 cities studied, 25 saw spreads increase after Booker.\nThe discrepancies most often turn up in cases where a defendant turns state\u2019s witness and provides assistance to the government, Cogan noted. \u201cSome judges would say \u2018go home, you did a wonderful job.\u2019 Others will say, \u2018I\u2019ll take a year off your 30-year sentence. That\u2019s the discretion they\u2019re supposed to have, and there\u2019s so much that varies from case to case and judge to judge.\u201d\nThe study raises complicated questions. On the one hand, the fact that a prison sentence could vary by years or even decades on what is essentially the flip of a coin, is difficult to square with a legal system that aspires to be \u201cblind\u201d and offer \u201cequal protection\u201d.\nOn the other hand, many attorneys and criminal justice reformers see laws that require judges to hand down preset sentence lengths a matter of profound injustice, especially when it requires them to order long, draconian sentences they themselves do not agree with.\n\u201cI think their discretion is good and important and useful because when judges are pigeonholed that takes their power and humanity away,\u201d said NiaLena Caravasos, a Philadelphia-area defense attorney who argues in federal court. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a proponent of a judge having as much discretion as possible \u2026 I\u2019d rather take my chances with a difficult judge and figure out how to reach them.\u201d\nJudges are not robots, Caravasos stressed. \u201cI have always found that it is most important to really understand where a judge is coming from and the things that she/he places great importance on,\u201d she added.\nFederal judges are still bound by mandatory minimum sentences in the majority of drug cases, even after Booker. The statutory mandatory minimums in those cases are different from the sentencing guidelines addressed by the ruling. Several of those mandatory minimums were rolled back slightly by the recent First Step criminal justice reform bill.",

In 1997, the remains were sent to the IWM as part of a collection of Holocaust-related items, despite the museum saying it did not wish to acquire the container.\nAs few details were supplied, the IWM \u2013 which is legally permitted to store human remains \u2013 commissioned tests. The English Heritage Centre for Archaeology found that the remains included human bone fragments, non-human bone fragments, construction material from cremation ovens, and ash \u2013 and suggested that the human remains were of six people, likely to be five adults and a child.\nThe IWM has looked after the remains since their arrival at the museum. However, as part of a review of its Holocaust-related items ahead of the construction of new galleries in 2021, the museum decided it was no longer appropriate to look after the remains. It sought advice from the office of the chief rabbi and the Auschwitz museum. The United Synagogue offered to hold a funeral.\nDiane Lees, the IWM\u2019s director-general, said: \u201cIt is hoped that the burial, which will be attended by members of Jewish and non-Jewish communities, will afford these individuals the respect and dignity they were denied in both life and death.\u201d\nIn a statement, the chief rabbi\u2019s office said: \u201cThese kedoshim [holy souls] will now be afforded the dignity of a Jewish funeral, within the loving embrace of our community \u2013 something which was denied to them and so many others during the course of the Shoah [Holocaust].\u201d Soil from Israel will be placed in the grave.\nGoldstein said: \u201cWe must remember that although we have only the remains of a number of victims of the Shoah, each was a person in their own right, with a family and a life and a Jewish identity, with hopes and dreams just like each of us. One of them was a child. I will hug my own children especially tightly next Sunday.\n\u201cI thank all of my colleagues who will make this burial possible and know that each of them feels acutely the huge burden of responsibility for what we are doing. We welcome all those who wish to attend to join us at the levaya [funeral] to pay their respects.\u201d\nKaren Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: \u201cWhen the camps were liberated, survivors started asking questions about their families: who survived, where were they, what happened to them?\n\u201cFor the majority, they had lost most, if not all, of their relatives in the Holocaust. They did not have a chance to say goodbye, attend a funeral or pay their respects to their own families and to the millions of Jews who were murdered and who did not have the burial they deserved.\n\u201cThis ceremony is firstly an opportunity to bless, bury and lay to rest these victims, but also it is a moment for Holocaust survivors, and for all of us, to come together and remember.\n\u201cToday, our hearts go out to everyone who had to endure the pain of losing loved ones during the Holocaust, the unique and unprecedented genocide of the Jewish people, and we pledge to continue our effort that the memories of those who were murdered live on.\u201d",

This, at least, is the comparison reviewers resort to most frequently to convey her surreal and lyrical style. It\u2019s true that Moskovich writes sentences that lilt and slink, her plots developing as a slow seduction and then clouding like a smoke-filled room. Her latest novel, Virtuoso, is an arrestingly self-assured follow-up to her 2016 debut The Natashas. It is similarly concerned with sexuality and violence, told in an off-kilter idiom, written by someone with a distinct taste for the weird.\nAnd \u201cweird\u201d is, perhaps, the simplest way to put it. Moskovich wears her weirdness with an indifferent dignity: Virtuoso is nonchalantly cool, heedlessly independent and puzzlingly askew. It\u2019s also hard to resist. You may like it \u2013 as I emphatically did \u2013 and yet find yourself hard pressed to say exactly why. If you don\u2019t care for it, you might find that its oddness stays with you nonetheless, like the residue of a headache-inducing perfume. Whichever the case, Virtuoso lingers.\nThe novel opens with a naked woman lying lifeless in a hotel room. This is Dominique, we\u2019ll learn later. She is French, an actor, only moderately successful; she has been struggling with depression. We don\u2019t quite \u201cmeet\u201d her in this opening sequence, not only because she\u2019s dead, but because Moskovich\u2019s narrative begins as a camera, dispassionately close up to the corpse.\nWhen the lens pans out, we see Dominique\u2019s wife returning to their suite. She sets down a bag of lemons, finds the body and tries to revive it. This is Aim\u00e9e: younger, a medical secretary, in love with Dominique but incapable, it turns out, of saving her.\nFilmic, here, is the right word and yet still not enough. It\u2019s a dramatic scene but it\u2019s Moskovich\u2019s turn of phrase, often unexpected and poetically cryptic, that makes us see it. The back of Dominique\u2019s knee is \u201ca gasp\u201d, the phone fallen from its cradle is \u201cbeeping hysterics\u201d, while Aim\u00e9e\u2019s hands \u201cclam at the sternum\u201d. She is \u201cscavenging the body for breath\u201d.\nFrom here, the novel both flashes back to the beginning of their relationship and proceeds forward, growing ever more surreal. Aim\u00e9e begins to suspect that she is being haunted by a mysterious blue vapour. Other characters and subplots emerge: an eerie online relationship between an American teenager and an eastern European housewife conducted via a lesbian chat room, and a friendship between two Czech girls, Jana and Zorka, growing up in the communist Prague of the 1980s. Moskovich pulls this off with some skill, moving confidently between timeframes and narrators.\nWomen \u2013 their friendships that can be formative and erotically charged, their desires that can feel unspeakable and intense \u2013 are clearly Moskovich\u2019s focus. She is especially alert to how visceral and disconnected the experience of a body can be. Images of spit, sweat, urine, bruises and welts surface repeatedly. Jana\u2019s armpits are damp when we first meet her; six-year-old Zorka has a \u201cstreak of violet blue\u201d under a swollen eye. She picks her nose and collects her saliva in a cup under the bed. Aim\u00e9e, in shock at the hospital, finds her chair filling \u201cwith a wet heat\u201d. The female body is unruly, difficult to keep in check: desire is like that, too. When a teenage Aim\u00e9e develops a crush on a girl called C\u00e9line dancing in a lesbian nightclub, she stares at her desperately, filled with both vicious hatred and hopeless lust: \u201cC\u00e9line, her eyes of green venom glowing in the spotlight, smoke crawling out of her red mouth\u201d.\nSo you\u2019d be right to detect a hint of Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, but there are other, equally potent influences as well. There\u2019s a touch of Elena Ferrante in the relationship between Jana and Zorka, which Moskovich draws with tenderness, conscious of the powerlessness of children against the turbulence of familial and national violence. Violence, in the novel, has an edge of cruel absurdity reminiscent of Antonin Artaud. Her depiction of sex has the fierce candour of an Ana\u00efs Nin short story. The mood of stylish languor carries the whiff of a Lana del Ray song.\nIn the end, though, Virtuoso is entirely Moskovich, told in her idiosyncratic voice and informed by her strange sensibility. In its weaker moments, that strangeness can leave readers confounded. A grotesque sequence in which Jana is besieged by a crowd of child muggers is bewildering, and the novel\u2019s closing paragraphs are perplexing to the point that you wonder if you are missing a page. At its best, though, Moskovich\u2019s writing is compulsive and determined in its efforts to get at desire, grief and love, things that are as sinewy and mysterious as the blue vapour that winds through the novel.\n Shahidha Bari\u2019s Dressed: The Secret Life of Clothes will be published later this year.

        "content": "Recorded in rural Texas, this atmospheric album switches from psych-pop to alt-rock to experimental lo-fi, held together by Bradford Cox\u2019s drawl\nThe eighth album by Deerhunter comes with a lot of words attached, of varying degrees of usefulness. There is a prose poem by frontman Bradford Cox every bit as incomprehensible as the stuff Bob Dylan used to append to the back covers of his 60s albums, evidently written while Dylan was speeding his nuts off. There are simple descriptors of the themes in each song: genuinely illuminating when dealing with a writer such as Cox, whose lyrics are famously made up on the spot, stream-of-consciousness style. But most telling of all might be the press release trumpeting the arrival of Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? to the world, unmistakably also Cox\u2019s handiwork. No \u201cit\u2019s our best album yet and we\u2019re psyched for you to hear it\u201d for the Atlanta band. Instead, it\u2019s largely concerned with glumly pondering what the point of making albums is at all: \u201cIn an era when attention spans have been reduced to next to nothing, and the tactile grains of making music have been further reduced to algorithms and projected playlist placement.\u201d He asks: \u201cIs it needed now? Is it relevant? Perhaps only to a small audience.\u201d\nAnnouncing your new album with an existential crisis is an intriguing promotional tactic, but doing things the straightforward way isn\u2019t Deerhunter\u2019s thing. In any other band, you suspect Cox\u2019s sexuality would be a major talking point \u2013 he identifies as a queer asexual, and two years ago informed an interviewer he was still a virgin \u2013 but it barely gets a look in, dwarfed by his reputation as an unpredictable contrarian. His interviews veer between alarmingly frank confessions about his physical and mental health and arch pronouncements he\u2019s described as \u201cperformance art\u201d. They come littered with bon mots you might describe as Morrissey-esque \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m proud to be hideous\u201d, \u201cLove is a populist construction\u201d \u2013 were it not for the fact that he spent one interview turning every answer around to the subject of how much he hates Morrissey (\u201che makes me want to wear fur\u201d). Deerhunter\u2019s musical output veers wildly, too. Much of 2013\u2019s Monomania sounded as if it was recorded in a bin; 2015\u2019s Fading Frontier was lavishly appointed with 80s synthesisers and filled with conventionally commercial melodies; its follow-up, Double-Dream of Spring, was largely instrumental and released only on cassette in a limited edition of 300, apparently in protest at both the long lead times for vinyl and the flood of freely available content online.\nUnpredictability is a rare and rather valuable commodity in a world of media-trained personalities and music dictated by the metrics of streaming services, and it\u2019s something Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? has in abundance. Far less aesthetically cohesive than Monomania or Fading Frontier, it never settles, skipping without warning from harpsichord-bedecked psych-pop to icy Tubeway Army-ish synth instrumentals, from elegiac alt-rock ballads to stuff that sounds like a lo-fi take on 80s Japanese environmental music, its disparate strands just about held together by Cox\u2019s drawling voice and the hazy quality of the production.\nMuch has been made of the fact that it was partly recorded in the sparsely populated Texan desert city of Marfa, and it\u2019s not hard to work out how the environment influenced its sound: there\u2019s a layer of echo suggestive of distance and empty space, while the rhythms have something of the sandstorm about them, distorted and gritty. Moreover, if there are moments where the album overplays its hand \u2013 a warped spoken-word track titled Detournement perhaps lays it on a bit thick \u2013 there\u2019s a confidence about its stylistic leaps that means it feels like the expression of an authentically idiosyncratic imagination rather than someone being weird and eclectic for the sake of it.\nThe lyrics are similarly scattered: if the title somehow suggests another despairing broadside against the evils of Trump\u2019s America from the US alt-rock fraternity, the reality is more intriguing and complex. You could certainly divine the overall mood of prickly unease and the references to pollution and toxicity in Element as having some basis in America\u2019s current upheavals: \u201cmay God\u2019s will be done in these poisoned hills and let the devil be cast out on his tail,\u201d snaps opener Death in Midsummer, in the language of the Christian right. But they come amid a gush of disparate and fascinating ideas: Futurism rails against nostalgia as a \u201ccage\u201d, Plains depicts James Dean filming Giant in Marfa, the town\u2019s isolation filling him with foreboding.\nIndeed, the most expressly political thing here refers not to America, but the UK. No One\u2019s Sleeping is an anguished response to the murder of MP Jo Cox, viewed from across the Atlantic. The music carries a distinct echo of the acoustic guitar-driven sound found on the Kinks\u2019 Days or Picture Book; the lyrics mention village greens fading into darkness. It\u2019s as if a stylised, quaint, distant view of England learned through Ray Davies\u2019 songs is warping and fracturing. It is unexpected and strange, and, like the rest of the album, beautifully done.\nPhil Cordell: Londonderry\n  Excavated on Ace\u2019s superb forthcoming compilation Three Day Week, a bizarre, haunting attempt to turn the Troubles into echoing, glammy pop: musical archeology at its most compelling.\n Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? is released on 18 January",

        "content": "The infection was a serious threat to British players in the years before a vaccination was introduced, claiming several lives, including that of the Manchester City full-back in 1902\nIn the past five recorded years, there have been 29 confirmed cases of tetanus in England and Wales and two fatalities, both women in their 80s. Vaccination has been so successful that the vicious, fatal effect of the infection has been forgotten.\nBut before a vaccination was introduced in the UK in 1961 tetanus was startlingly common and, as it is possible for even the most trivial wound to lead to infection, it made almost any activity potentially fatal. To give a few British-based examples: in 1923 a seven-year-old died after hurting his hand on a toy pistol; in 1927 a farmer died after falling over a pig; the previous year a 62-year-old woman died after scraping her elbow while picking peas; and in August 1899 a man died from an injury sustained while playing the leisurely garden game of quoits. His was the fourth death from tetanus in Kent that week.\nFootball is considerably more dangerous than quoits. With the bacteria that causes tetanus commonly found in soil, the idea of flinging yourself around a muddy field was in many ways not the wisest. In Woodside cemetery in Paisley stands a 14ft-high granite monument commemorating one of the great Scottish players of the late 1800s, James Dunlop. \u201cDunlop was built on graceful, slender, ladylike lines,\u201d the newspaper Scottish Referee wrote in 1902. \u201cFor him to be on the wing was as natural as a bird. There was no pell-mell forging ahead in his style, for he glided to goal like a sylph.\u201d On New Year\u2019s Day 1892 Dunlop was playing for St Mirren when \u201csome idiotic spectator threw a broken bottle, on which he fell and cut his knee\u201d. He died, aged only 21, 10 days later.\nThere were other victims: Arsenal\u2019s Joe Powell fractured his wrist against Kettering in 1896 and, despite having the arm amputated in a desperate attempt to save his life, died five days later. In 1899 a Reading player called Baker died after breaking his ankle. In 1923 Port Vale\u2019s Tom Butler died after breaking his arm while playing against Clapton \u2013 now Leyton \u2013 Orient, and six years later Orient\u2019s centre-half Harry Cunningham died after breaking a big toe. A basic search of newspaper archives finds dozens of deaths caused by tetanus contracted during games of amateur football. \u201cEven the tiniest, most superficial wound can lead to tetanus,\u201d Dr Alastair Ironside of Manchester\u2019s Monsall hospital told the Guardian in 1968, recommending that all clubs ensure their players are vaccinated. \u201cA player might think nothing of it but he could be dead within a week.\u201d\nThe most famous case concerned the Wales full-back Di Jones, \u201ca remarkable tackler\u201d who \u201cplayed the open game to perfection\u201d and spent a decade at Bolton before being bought by Manchester City for the princely sum of \u00a325 in 1898.\nFour years later he was playing in a pre-season training game when he fell and badly gashed his knee. Jones said the cut was caused by broken glass embedded in the pitch but after his death City insisted \u201cthere was no truth in this at all\u201d, forcing the Manchester Evening News to print a retraction. \u201cThe statement would lead the public to suppose the management showed no care or supervision of the playing enclosure, whereas the most careful attention is given to it,\u201d their manager, Tom Maley, insisted.\nThe wound was treated at the scene and Jones walked 180 yards to an ambulance \u2013 despite being advised to go on a stretcher \u2013 before being taken to hospital, where he told his family the knee was \u201cwiped with a rag and stitched up\u201d. He returned home but the wound started to suppurate, discharging amid the pus, grass, mud and what his doctor thought was the head of a used match. Soon he could only eat when anaesthetised with chloroform, and in 10 days he was dead.\nAt the coroner\u2019s hearing City said \u201cthe usual dressings and cleansing matters were applied to the wound by skilled people\u201d (though not medics) at the ground, while the doctor who treated him at Manchester Royal Infirmary insisted the wound \u201ccould not have been cleaned any more than it was\u201d. He however admitted \u201cit was possible that some grass might have got into a pocket under the skin, in which event it would not become visible until suppuration commenced\u201d. The player\u2019s own doctor suggested this happened not while he was in contact with any grass but during the walk to the ambulance.\nAfter hearing the evidence, the jury was not satisfied the injury had been properly treated either at the ground or hospital. \u201cWe cannot understand how, with such a strong, stalwart man, this tetanus could have set in if he had been properly attended to,\u201d said the foreman. Furthermore, if walking to the ambulance was such a bad idea, surely he should have been stopped from doing so.\nHowever Jones, a former miner, was a big man and Maley insisted: \u201cIt was a matter of impossibility to dictate to Jones. Moral suasion was no good and physical force was out of the question. The stretcher was brought but he would not use it. He pushed everyone away.\u201d\nThe jury was unhappy that blame had been pinned entirely on the player. Even if his refusal to climb on a stretcher ultimately led to his infection, they \u201cwanted to impress upon football clubs that they should not allow a man to walk off the field in a case like that\u201d. The coroner dismissed this suggestion. \u201cAre football clubs to supply a medical staff at the ground for every match?\u201d he scoffed.\nHe exonerated the club and Jones\u2019s death was declared an accident.\nThe player left a wife and two children. His daughter, Nellie, was four weeks old when he died. Some reports suggest City refused to help them but this at least appears wide of the mark: they played Bolton in a benefit match, raising \u00a3100. They presented his family with this sum the following December, though it is not clear whether this was the testimonial money, delayed for 15 months, or a different payment. It certainly did not attract the kind of controversy that such a delay might have warranted: \u201cManchester City believe in treating their players handsomely,\u201d the Athletic News glowingly reported. The family cannot have been too upset, because three months after Jones\u2019s death his nephew William, better known as Lot, signed for City, going on to play 301 games for them.\nIt was many years before clubs were compelled to supply a trained medic for every match and they were in no hurry to immunise players even when a tetanus vaccine became available \u2013 Neil Phillips, England\u2019s team doctor, was astonished to find that many players were not protected before the 1970 World Cup. But in the months after Jones\u2019s injury, customers at one Manchester sports shop would have noticed a new range of cleansing ointments, produced by the shop\u2019s co-owner Billy Meredith: after the death of his great friend and former schoolmate the legendary Welsh forward decided footballers should probably learn how to clean their wounds themselves.",

No, seriously, please start saying cheese at the grocery store. The country\u2019s dairy farmers are depending on you.\nAmericans eat an awful lot of cheese: almost 37lb per person, per year. Yet apparently that\u2019s still not enough. Demand for American-made cheese is seriously falling behind supply. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, we\u2019re currently experiencing a 1.4bn-pound cheese surplus.\nLucas Fuess, director of dairy market intelligence at HighGround Dairy, a consulting firm, explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza-maker to give it a home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal to have some cheese in warehouses, to make sure there\u2019s enough in the pipeline,\u201d Fuess said. \u201cThe amount that\u2019s in there currently is, if not a record, very close to record high.\u201d\nIn part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism. Plant-based products such as almond-milk have experienced rapid sales growth.\nSince 2008, milk production has surged by 13%, but domestic demand for milk has dropped sharply. As demand decreases, the price of milk drops, and farmers receive less per gallon produced. This appears to have pushed farmers to produce even more milk to make up the shortfalls in their income, exacerbating the problem.\nProducing American cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can\u2019t sell and that would otherwise go off. At the end of November 2018, US cheese production had grown yet again for the 67th consecutive month.\nBut the problem is Americans are eating less cheese, too.\nAmerican diets are moving away from processed cheeses like Velveeta and Kraft, and many of the nation\u2019s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things. Panera, like others, has replaced American cheese in their sandwiches with a four-cheese combo made up of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda.\nAccording to Euromonitor International, sales of processed cheese are projected to drop 1.6% this year, the fourth year in a row.\nIn part, that\u2019s because many Americans now think processed cheese is gross, but also because they\u2019re au fait with quality cheese from around the world. It\u2019s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you\u2019ve tried brie de meaux.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased sales of more exotic, specialty, European-style cheeses. Some of those are made in the US; a lot of them aren\u2019t,\u201d Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University told NPR this week. Since imported cheese costs more than domestic, a few blocks of the good stuff might not leave much left in the old cheese budget for anything else.\nThe cheese mountain is crushing farmers. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen record numbers of dairy farms close because milk prices are so low that dairy farms aren\u2019t profitable any more,\u201d Feueff added. \u201cThis cheese that is hanging over the market is preventing prices from raising higher and it\u2019s reaching a critical level.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s trade policy has also played a role in the cheesepocalypse. In response to his tariffs, three top importers of US milk and cheese products \u2013 Mexico, Canada and China \u2013 have instituted retaliatory tariffs that will have a significant impact on American dairy farmers\u2019 bottom line, according to a study from Texas A&M University.\n\u201cAs long as the tariffs are still on in Mexico, it remains a challenge to move cheese out of the country and move those stocks lower,\u201d Fuess explained.\nIt\u2019s not the end of the line. Analysts have noted large buyers of cheese increasing offerings or finding new ways to use it. McDonald\u2019s recently launched a breakfast sandwich with two slices of American cheese. \u201cFast-food companies are taking this opportunity with low cheese prices to increase cheese on their dishes,\u201d says Fuess.\nFor now though, American dairy farmers are going to continue to look for ways to offload their cheese supplies. \u201cI was just reading stories of cheese tea in China that have kind of gone viral,\u201d Fuess said. \u201cMaybe we need to look into that.\u201d",

        "content": "Derry, February 1981: a close-knit bunch of teenagers are getting their kicks in the dingy Cave club, where the city\u2019s assorted tribes experiment with illicit substances and snog to the heady sounds of post-punk, ska and dub. Liz, her brother Paddy, Orla, Sin\u00e9ad, Noel and Christy are all about to take exams, leave home, get serious. Liz\u2019s boyfriend Kevin is older, a man with a shadowy history; Orla\u2019s Peter is a new flame.\nBut events beyond this haven are about to take control of the narrative. Inside the nearby Maze prison, the republican hunger strike gets under way. Outside, in streets occupied by the British army, riots are fomented. Paddy and Christy are drawn into nightly skirmishes, the hormonal rush of the action as much of a buzz as their pharmaceutical experiments. Kevin, whose youthful dissent led to disaster, runs into a face from the past who attempts to lure him back. When the strike leader, and by then Member of Parliament, Bobby Sands is read the last rites on Good Friday, the Catholic city rises. Paddy and Christy witness a friend struck down in a haze of petrol fumes and plastic bullets. Suddenly, incoherent rage finds a focus, something that can be channelled \u2026\nThough the title is reminiscent of recent punk memoirs by Viv Albertine and Cosey Fanni Tutti, none of the characters is trying to use music as a way out of a city beset by unemployment, poverty and sectarian strife. Instead, this is an examination of the tumultuous effects of recent history on the generation who came of age during the politically toxic early 80s within its most explosive terrain \u2013 for which the work of Gang of Four, Linton Kwesi Johnson, the Banshees and the Specials makes a brilliantly illustrative soundtrack. With the recent Derry Girls TV series and Milkman winning the Man Booker, Northern Ireland is experiencing a cultural resurgence.\nThis debut marks out Quigley as a writer of compassion and humour who wields thorough research with a deft touch. She not only demonstrates how easy it is to be swept into hot-blooded actions that have chilling repercussions, she also draws a wider picture of poverty and familial dysfunction, exploring how the stability or otherwise of an individual\u2019s childhood affects their adult life. Her clever, multiple-narrative account of the way a community is affected by a youngster going for a night out and never coming home illustrates why the Undertones, formed in Derry, sang so passionately about normal teenage thrills.\n Music Love Drugs War is published by Fig Tree.

Shards of bombs found at several sites where civilians died have been traced back to the US-based company, according to CNN.\nThe Saudi air force uses Eurofighter Typhoons, made by a consortium including Airbus and the British company BAE Systems, while Tornado fighter-bombers are manufactured by BAE Systems.\nThe kingdom bought 17% of everything the UK defence contractor sold last year and BAE Systems employs 6,000 people on the ground in Saudi Arabia.\nThe US company Northrop Grumman is also a major contractor to the Saudi military, according to its website, which states it is \u201cheavily involved in the training and development of the Saudi military personnel, most notably providing technical services for the ministry of the national guard\u201d.\nThe council with the largest investment in the five named companies is Lothian, which manages funds worth \u00a37.8bn for staff including Edinburgh city council workers.\nIts trustees have \u00a385m invested with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon, deriving \u00a33.8m in revenue from their holdings over the latest 12-month period for which records are available.\nWest Yorkshire pension fund, including Leeds city council and Bradford council employees, had \u00a378.4m of holdings and earned \u00a32m of dividends, spread across BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and Airbus.\nTameside pension fund, including Greater Manchester, has \u00a379m invested with Raytheon and BAE Systems, pulling in \u00a32.65m of dividend income over 12 months.\nA spokesman for Tameside council referred the Guardian to its ethical investment policy, which states \u201capplying ethical, environmental or any other non-commercial policy either to investments generally or to selecting fund managers would be inconsistent with our legal duties and responsibilities\u201d.\nThe council added that trustees \u201cdo not actively invest in or disinvest from companies solely or largely for social, ethical or environmental reasons\u201d.\nA further 40 local authority pension funds hold similar investments, with values ranging from negligible sums to tens of millions of pounds.\nThe Guardian has approached West Yorkshire pension fund and Lothian pension fund for comment.",

        "content": "The rapper\u2019s new album, Championships, topped the US chart \u2013 but after a controversial jail term, he remains haunted by a US legal system he is now trying to change\nThe first time Meek Mill took part in a rap battle, he left in tears. \u201cThe guy battling me was 16 years old, and I was 13 or 14 \u2013 he was more advanced than me,\u201d the 31-year-old recalls. \u201cI lost by a long shot, but it gave me ambition. I told everybody before I left: \u2018One day, you all will be playing my music.\u2019\u201d Hours before we sit down to chat in a ritzy Manhattan restaurant, the rapper\u2019s fourth proper studio album, Championships, goes into the US charts at No 1. It is his second chart-topping record, after Dreams Worth More Than Money in 2015.\nAs he sips camomile tea with a side order of raw ginger, Meek \u2013 real name Robert Rihmeek Williams \u2013 carefully unlocks a giant, diamond-studded chain, and places it on the table with the care of Indiana Jones swapping idols in Raiders of the Lost Ark. \u201cI\u2019m sick as hell right now,\u201d he croaks between sips. His whirlwind schedule doesn\u2019t allow for much rest; he\u2019ll be whisked across town to tape an appearance on The Daily Show after our conversation and has just come from the set of a film about urban dirt-bike riders, 12 O\u2019Clock Boys. It\u2019s his acting debut, portraying a character who \u201c[reflects] on myself \u2013 someone who\u2019s been in prison and comes home and tries to change his life\u201d.\nThe release of Championships should be a triumphant moment for Meek. His strongest record yet, it pairs Meek\u2019s penchant for full-throated intensity with glossy, cavernous beats. With its big-deal guest appearances, it has already made headlines, from speculation about whether Jay-Z\u2019s pointed lines on What\u2019s Free address Kanye West\u2019s newfound Donald Trump fanaticism, to Meek\u2019s team-up with his one-time rival Drake on Going Bad. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy when it\u2019s competition \u2013 it\u2019s our job,\u201d Meek says, stating that any bad blood between him and Drake is now firmly in the past. \u201cJay wasn\u2019t talking to Kanye \u2013 he was talking to whoever was influencing Kanye. I never viewed that as a diss when I put it on my record.\u201d\nThe album arrives at a time when public goodwill towards Meek has never been stronger. \u201cGetting support from the people is always a great feeling,\u201d he says. He has needed it over the past 18 months. His history of legal troubles, culminating in a five-month jail stint last year, can be traced back to his upbringing in north Philadelphia, where his family moved following the death of his father when Meek was five.\n\u201cGrowing up in the rough neighbourhoods in America is all the same \u2013 coming up around drugs, violence, murder,\u201d he says. \u201cThe police are there, but not to the level of protection. Coming up in a ruthless environment as a kid, you learn from what you see.\u201d He relied on female role models, from his sister and mother to the music of Deborah Cox and Lauryn Hill. \u201cIt made me look at women as stronger,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mom did everything for us \u2013 I\u2019ve always viewed her as a man and a woman, all in one. It made me think all women were extremely strong and manly.\u201d\nHis uncle, the Philadelphia-based DJ Grandmaster Nell, played hip-hop records for Meek at his grandmother\u2019s house, and Meek developed his distinctive flow \u2013 imagine a sentient air horn, or a boxing announcer\u2019s theatrical timbre turned up to the max. \u201cIf you were to walk out [of] here and someone drove by half a block away, playing my music loud, you could still hear my voice,\u201d he claims, citing Jay-Z\u2019s protege Memphis Bleek as a formative influence.\nThroughout his adolescence, scuffles with police were a constant. Meek estimates that by the age of 18 he had been arrested 10 times for charges that didn\u2019t stick. Then, in January 2007, he was arrested for illegal gun possession \u2013 and his decade-long legal troubles began. \u201cI was carrying a gun because I felt I needed it to survive,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you put me back in that situation right now, I\u2019d still carry that gun. People like me die on a daily basis.\u201d When the cops approached him in south-west Philadelphia, Meek claims, he tossed the gun to the ground and lay on the ground, preparing for arrest; the arresting officer, Reginald Graham, maintains that Meek instead pointed the gun directly at him. \u201cFrom there on in, it was lights out,\u201d Meek alleges. \u201cI was getting knocked out.\n\u201cI was prepared to face the consequences,\u201d Meek says of the gun charge, but the cops also charged him with drug dealing and assaulting a police officer. The guilty verdict led to a one-year prison sentence and 10 years\u2019 probation. Prison conditions \u2013 showering amid excrement-smeared walls, washing his underwear in the sink, navigating soap shortages \u2013 stay with Meek. \u201cIt was a big transition,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to adapt.\u201d\nTo this day, he contests the dealing and assault charges, and he\u2019s not alone; in March last year, Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney cast doubt on Graham\u2019s original report. \u201cIn the ghettoes of America, if you\u2019re a young man pointing a gun at a cop, you\u2019re dead,\u201d is Meek\u2019s comment on the accusation. \u201cPolice officers will tell you: \u2018We\u2019re trained to kill you if you threaten our lives.\u2019 That\u2019s normal.\u201d\nWhen the judge Genece Brinkley was assigned to preside over his probation, Meek hoped she would show a measure of sympathy for his situation: \u201cShe\u2019s a black judge. She comes from my neighbourhood.\u201d\nAfter a brief dalliance with TI\u2019s Grand Hustle label, Meek linked up with the Miami rapper Rick Ross\u2019s Maybach Music Group, but his rise to stardom was interrupted by legal difficulties. After a party celebrating the release of Meek\u2019s 2012 debut, Dreams and Nightmares, he was briefly detained by police after a car he was riding in was pulled over (no charges were filed). \u201cIt always felt to me that, as I got bigger, things got worse,\u201d he says.\nAs the years passed, it became increasingly clear that Brinkley was not the sympathetic figure that Meek had hoped for. The probation officer she assigned to him would allegedly phone at 6am every day, demanding to know his every move, even though he wasn\u2019t under house arrest; in 2013, Brinkley ordered him to attend etiquette classes because of his perceived rudeness during court proceedings. The judge would apparently show up to his court-ordered community service unannounced, and, during a private meeting with Meek and his then-girlfriend Nicki Minaj in 2016, allegedly asked him to record a cover of Philadelphia R&B legends Boyz II Men\u2019s track On Bended Knee and dedicate a lyric to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to laugh in her face \u2013 she had my life in her hands,\u201d Meek says. \u201cJay-Z said: \u2018If I hadn\u2019t sent nobody to court to see what was going on with you, I would\u2019ve never believed what you were saying \u2013 it sounded too outrageous.\u2019\u201d\nThat same year, his present probation officer recommended a six-month stay in rehab to help Meek deal with the \u201con-and-off\u201d Percocet addiction he had developed while dealing with the pressure of regular court appearances. \u201cThe last time I took it was in 2016 \u2013 right before I went to court \u2013 because I was so nervous,\u201d he says. The treatment worked, but in November 2017 Brinkley cited the failed drug test that prompted the treatment \u2013 as well as assault charges that were later dropped \u2013 while sentencing Meek to two to four years in prison for breaking his parole.\nHe went back to jail, spending most of it in solitary confinement because of his celebrity. It was \u201chell on earth\u201d, he says. \u201cI was going crazy \u2013 I could only wash every four days, I was depressed from facing two to four years. They put me on the block with crazy people. When my lawyer came to see me, I said: \u2018Did I lose my mind?\u2019\u201d\nWhile Meek was isolated from the outside world, fans were rallying in his support, from protests on the streets of Philadelphia to big-name supporters ranging from Jay-Z to the basketball player Joel Embiid. During the 2018 Winter Olympics, the Slovenian snowboarder Tit Stante appeared on television with \u201cFree Meek Mill\u201d written on the tip of his board. \u201cIt was shocking to me,\u201d Meek says. \u201cWhen you grow up in a wild environment, you don\u2019t get support, so that was big for me.\u201d\nReleased on bail in April 2018, after the Pennsylvania supreme court overturned his 2017 sentence, Meek called for the criminal justice system to be reformed. When he was invited to Trump\u2019s White House, however, he said no. \u201cIt was too risky \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to attach myself to that.\u201d\nHe remains vocal about everything from probation and bail to who ends up in prison and what they must endure there. \u201cI could piss in an alleyway out here, and a cop could pull over and lock me up with killers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey got guys with DUIs in there alongside real rapists and gangsters. The system places you in a fuckin\u2019 ruthless environment, where people are getting raped and stabbed \u2013 and they\u2019re never the same when they come out.\u201d\nBut while Meek\u2019s legal team continues to file appeals to have Brinkley removed from his case, to put an end to his probation, and to overturn his original 2008 conviction, he has no intention of becoming a full-time activist. \u201cI don\u2019t want to become the face of [reform] because I\u2019m not a perfect person,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be a good father [he has two children, Rihmeek and Murad, with his former girlfriend Fahimah Raheem], make a lot of money and help bring change if I could. I\u2019m always attached to my neighbourhood.\u201d\nBut the shadow of the legal system still looms large. \u201cI always hear rumours of groups of law enforcement investigating me, watching over me,\u201d he says. \u201cThat always puts fear in my heart. I tell my friends \u2013 even the most powerful ones \u2013 always to stand behind me because there are always people out there who want to show me as someone I\u2019m not. It scares me.\u201d",

But it is something of a conundrum that, while Arsenal draw breath for next season\u2019s Battle For Fourth, a player they apparently have little future use for will be heading to the summit of Serie A and \u2013 presumably \u2013 a regular place in the latter stages of Big Cup, preparing to slot into the middle alongside Blaise Matuidi and Miralem Pjanic.\nRamsey will be asked to channel his inner John Charles, \u201cIl Gigante Buono\u201d, in Turin. They love a buccaneering Welshman there \u2013 those who can remember the 1950s and 60s, anyway \u2013 and if history is an accurate guide he should increase his league title tally from zero to something near Charles\u2019s tally of three. It has been some time coming: Ramsey was struck by horror-knack soon after joining Arsenal; recovered only to find himself the target of brainless boo-boys; cast that all aside to score seemingly every time he kicked a ball in 2013-14; scored two FA Cup final winners in a period when the Emirates Cup was the only other trophy to which they gave the glad eye; kept on keeping on, yet still never quite found his rightful place, either in the team or supporters\u2019 affections.\nA rumbustious reincarnation of early $tevie Mbe? A canny operator with Lampard-esque timing? Perhaps an all-round string-puller extraordinaire of the Toni Kroos stripe? Nobody has ever quite worked out what Ramsey is, but then it would take a crack class of PhD students in undelivered promise to work out what Arsenal have been in the past few years either. Tough decisions \u2013 like giving Mesut \u00d6zil a bumper new deal and then realising your biggest creative threat comes from Sead Kolasinac \u2013 need making and Unai Emery already has one well-remunerated playmaker to keep happy, after all. Their planning might have been shoddy but Ramsey\u2019s might have turned out to be rather astute. His present and future employers\u2019 trajectories are already set for now, and he won\u2019t change that; he should be remembered properly as a winner in future, though, and that might be the sweetest deal of all.\n\u201cIn particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness\u201d \u2013 a major new study reveals the \u201cdire consequences\u201d of football\u2019s relationship with gambling.\nIt\u2019s only Football Weekly Extra.\nProducing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism [the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 Fiver Ed] is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t.

        "content": "Scotland\u2019s tech industry is growing \u2013 and when it comes to gender inclusion, it leads the UK with women making up 20% of the workforce. Could this be why the sector is thriving?\nIn the past decade, Edinburgh has quietly become one of the UK\u2019s most thriving tech hubs. According to the Tech Nation UK 2018 report (pdf), the city saw a 526% increase in digital startups between 2006 and 2016. It was named the UK\u2019s best city to launch a startup in 2017, thanks in part to this entrepreneurial explosion and its business survival rates over a five-year period. That\u2019s before considering the wealth of student and graduate talent in the city.\nTech workers will also find lively digital startup scenes in Glasgow, where the sector contributes \u00a31.31bn in gross value added to the city\u2019s economy, and Dundee, whose growing tech cluster has nearly doubled its turnover since 2014.\nThe Scottish government\u2019s Scotland Is Now marketing campaign, launched earlier this year, aims to draw even more talent into the country by emphasising Scotland\u2019s openness to students, investors, migrants and visitors.\nSo is all of this growth and government support making a difference when it comes to gender equality in the traditionally male-dominated tech sector?\nThe statistics seem promising. According to the British Computer Society\u2019s 2017 diversity report (pdf), Scotland leads the UK in terms of gender inclusion in the tech sector, with women making up 20% of tech professionals (compared with 17% nationally). This, however, is a long way off being representative of the population.\nJude McCorry is head of business development at The Data Lab, a Scottish data-science centre. She says by far the greatest strength of the scene in Scotland, and particularly in comparison with its counterparts in other areas of the UK, is the atmosphere of collaboration.\n\u201cI\u2019m Irish and people always look to Ireland for the answers for the tech community,\u201d she says. \u201cIt attracted a lot of major multinationals on the back of the tax situation.\u201d Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate (in comparison with 19% in the UK) has seen tech behemoths including Facebook, Google and Twitter setting up their European headquarters in Dublin.\n\u201cScotland has had to compete,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut where it\u2019s found a niche is around the sense of community. People here really do look after each other.\u201d\nEdinburgh, in particular, was praised in the Tech Nation 2017 report for its \u201chighly supportive digital community\u201d. The Scottish tech sector is helped further by a healthy meet-up scene; the Scotland Data Science and Technology Meetup now has more than 3,000 members, convening each month in cities across the country for talks on topics ranging from data in foodtech, to what the games industry has to teach other sectors.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that this supportive climate has sprung up in an environment driven by women, McCorry says, with female leaders at the forefront of many startups and established businesses, as well as the finance houses and other organisations that fund and support them. She points to Polly Purvis, CEO of digital trade body ScotlandIS; Jackie Waring, CEO and founder of angel investment company Women Investing; and Gillian Doherty, CEO of The Data Lab.\nLikewise, there\u2019s Carolyn Jameson, chief legal officer at Skyscanner, the unicorn travel company that became one of Scotland\u2019s biggest tech success stories (it was established in Edinburgh in 2002 and sold for \u00a31.6bn in 2016 to Chinese firm Ctrip, where Jameson is also now head of international mergers and acquisitions, and corporate affairs). She arrived in Scotland from the London commuter belt town, Newbury, 11 years ago, she explains, and says the country is \u201cunrecognisable now\u201d, as a result of the tech developments.\n\u201cOne of the main advantages Scotland has is that it\u2019s small that there\u2019s still a vibrant sense of community; and that\u2019s what has helped it to thrive.\u201d\nBut, she continues, that\u2019s not to say that Scotland has completely overcome the sexism that permeates the tech industry in general. Attitudes can \u201cabsolutely be challenging at times\u201d, she says.\n\u201cThose wider networks are still largely made up of men and that can be a barrier to breaking in. The gender imbalance is still an issue.\u201d\nBut, in general, there\u2019s a consistent effort in Scotland to have women properly represented and catered for, says McCorry. The government has committed to increasing free childcare for three- and four-year-olds from 600 hours to 1,140 hours per year by 2020, and the country is making progress on the gender pay gap, which is 6.6% for full-time workers, in comparison with the UK-wide figure of 9.9%. And the government-backed Equate Scotland initiative, launched in 2006, is working to increase gender equality in science, technology, engineering and maths.\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that Scotland\u2019s scene is simply smaller than many other hubs across the UK, however. Tech Nation estimates that Edinburgh and Glasgow are each home to around 10,000 jobs in digital tech, while Bristol has more than 24,000 and Manchester has in the region of 30,000, all of which are dwarfed by London\u2019s 318,000. It\u2019s understandable, then, that women would be tempted to look south of the border for work. Likewise, the majority of Scotland\u2019s graduates still tend to leave the country; a 2018 survey found that only 32% of those studying in the country were planning to stay after completing their courses.\nComputer scientist Tayyaba Nafees is just starting out in the Scottish tech world after completing her PhD in cybersecurity at Abertay University. She recently launched her company, CyberShell Solutions, to market a tool she created in her PhD; it preempts weaknesses in software design that could be exploited by hackers, enabling companies to protect against attacks before they happen.\nThe project has already shown incredible promise, winning Nafees an enterprise fellowship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh, third place at this year\u2019s Converge Challenge enterprise contest (which showcases innovative ideas from Scottish universities) and, most recently, the Rising Star award at the 2018 Scottish Women in Technology (SWiT) awards.\nThis support has encouraged Nafees, who is originally from Pakistan, to carry on in a field where she is well aware that people like her are underrepresented.\n\u201cCybersecurity is a very male-dominated area and I am Muslim woman,\u201d she says. \u201cBut SWiT has given me a huge network and connections to find more women who can mentor me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s shown me that I\u2019m not the only woman working in this area; there are many and they are doing a brilliant and successful job. It\u2019s given me a lot of confidence that what I am doing is right. Women here are working and making a difference, and that\u2019s a true inspiration.\u201d",

        "content": "Downing Street says one amendment would be allowed to motion if PM\u2019s deal is defeated\nDowning Street has said that if Theresa May\u2019s deal is voted down, any debate over a Brexit plan B would be 90 minutes long and only one amendment would be allowed.\nThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters at Thursday morning\u2019s lobby briefing that No 10\u2019s understanding of the Dominic Grieve amendment, which requires May to outline a plan B in three working days if she is defeated, was that only a limited debate would then be allowed.\nThe spokesman said: \u201c[In relation to] the motion that would follow from the Grieve amendment, there would only be 90 minutes of debate on the motion, is our understanding, and only one amendment could be selected.\u201d\nThe government was controversially defeated on Wednesday by 308 to 297 after John Bercow, the Speaker, allowed the Conservative backbencher to submit an amendment reducing the amount of time May would have to act.\nAny Brexit plan B debate would be likely to be held in a crisis atmosphere with intense pressure on MPs to decide how to act.\nNo 10 conceded that its interpretation of parliamentary procedure relating to the Grieve amendment could be overturned by Bercow. \u201cObviously these things are subject to interpretation by the Speaker of the house,\u201d the spokesman said.\nMPs were quick to voice concern, with Yvette Cooper raising a point of order a few hours later in the Commons, asking Bercow to clarify that the government could allow more time for any plan B Brexit debate if it so wished.\nCooper said: \u201cGiven that the prime minister and the government are saying they want to listen, that they want to reach out, that they want to build consensus, how \u2013 if this is the case \u2013 can we believe anything that the government is saying.\u201d\nUnusually, Julian Smith, the chief whip, intervened, to insist that no final decision had been made by the government on how to handle the plan B debate \u2013 and even claimed, despite the earlier on-the-record briefing by May\u2019s spokesman, that \u201cthe information is not correct\u201d.\nResponding to Cooper, Bercow said that the default procedure under House of Commons standing order 16.1 is that \u201cdebates pursuant on an act of parliament must be concluded within 90 minutes\u201d, which leads to a practical restriction on amendments.\nHowever, the Speaker added that it would be \u201cperfectly open to the government if such a situation were to arise to provide for a much fuller debate\u201d and if ministers refused to do so, then MPs would probably be able to force a longer debate on the government.\n\u201cI am extremely confident if that hypothetical scenario were to arise that colleagues would assert themselves,\u201d Bercow told MPs, indicating he expected parliament to demand a longer debate.\nCatherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said she believed that No 10 was stirring up conflict with the Speaker. She said Downing Street\u2019s claim amounted to \u201ccontinuing the guerrilla warfare of their respective parliamentary procedure advisers battling it out through Erskine May [the handbook of parliamentary procedure].\u201d\nLabour sources said a 90-minute debate was insufficient. One said: \u201c[It] is not enough, and entirely consistent with this government\u2019s approach of dodging scrutiny by trying to deny MPs debating time and votes.\u201d\nMPs are likely to want to submit a string of amendments for a second referendum or in support of a Norway-plus option of remaining in the single market and customs union.\nDowning Street said it understood that it would have to table a motion outlining what it planned to do next by the evening of Monday 21 January, three sitting days after May\u2019s Brexit deal is due to be voted on by MPs.\nFew believe May\u2019s deal will pass next Tuesday given that 100 Tory MPs and the DUP have said they will vote against it, although there was a formal acknowledgement that the prime minister hopes to win over a few Labour MPs.\nThe spokesman also indicated that Downing Street would \u201cconsider very seriously\u201d supporting an amendment put down by the Labour backbenchers John Mann, Caroline Flint and Gareth Snell, calling for guarantees on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards after Brexit.\nIt is the first time Downing Street has publicly acknowledged it is seeking the support of Labour rebels in pro-leave seats, although the idea was first aired last October, and follows contacts between the government and some of the concerned MPs.\nMay\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cI think if it is chosen [by the Speaker], then that is something we could consider very seriously.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government and the prime minister have a long-standing commitment to strong labour protections.\u201d",

He wanted to know if they sold P\u0105czki, donuts eaten on the Polish answer to pancake day. They call it Fat Thursday (T\u0142usty Czwartek) and the 72-year-old was trying to order a big batch for a Rotary Club do next month.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recently had a new Polish member and I thought it would be nice to make her feel welcome,\u201d the retired policeman said.\nTalk turned to Brexit. Clarke was one of the 66.4% of Wakefield residents who voted to leave \u2013 \u201cand if there is another vote I would vote leave again. I think we have been treated appallingly by the EU.\u201d\nHe saw no contradiction in enjoying a restaurant opened by a young Polish woman taking advantage of the EU\u2019s freedom of movement and labour, and Brexit. He seemed surprised that his vote might have made Poles feel unwanted.\n\u201cDoes it?\u201d he asked Sabina Niemczyk, the 29-year-old waitress, who came to the UK four years ago. \u201cIt does a bit,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cEspecially when I used to work in a shop and could hear people saying I should go back to my country.\u201d She plans to go home again in 10 months.\nClarke went to reassure her. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with people who work. It\u2019s the scroungers I don\u2019t like. The ones who come on the back of a lorry.\u201d Never mind that asylum seekers who arrive hidden in trucks are a) not European and b) not entitled to claim benefits. Clarke\u2019s Brexit vote wasn\u2019t really about immigration, he said \u2013 his niece is married to a German and recently got her German passport \u201cjust in case\u201d. For him, it is about sovereignty and the EU \u201cbit by bit taking extra power \u2013 it\u2019s become a government in itself\u201d.\nHe was unconvinced that Jeremy Corbyn could do a better job than Theresa May and negotiate a better deal, including a new customs union. \u201cWell, how?\u201d he asked. \u201cOthers have tried and failed.\u201d\nCorbyn\u2019s call for a general election may not pay off in Wakefield, where Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh has a delicate 2,176 majority over the Tories. Joiner Geoffrey Walpole, 60, said he didn\u2019t know who he would vote for but certainly not Corbyn \u2013 \u201che\u2019s never done a day\u2019s work in his life\u201d. He voted for Ukip last time they stood, in 2015, coming third, but thinks \u201cthey\u2019ve had the stuffing knocked out of them\u201d.\nPeople are too scared to take a risk and deviate from the main parties, he believes: \u201cIf you told the British public to take fewer breaths every day because there was a shortage of oxygen, most people would do it. People are frightened.\u201d\nIn the carpark of OE Electrics, where the camera trucks stood to broadcast the Labour leader\u2019s speech, three Wakefield remainers were protesting.\nRobert Gosling, 66, had made his own flagpole out of his washing line to wave his EU flag. \u201cA man\u2019s just gone past in the car, he [said] \u2018we\u2019re leaving aren\u2019t we?\u2019, and I said, \u2018well, no one voted to be worse off\u2019. He said he would take \u00a320 a week less if there was no immigration. But in Wakefield with the nurses, there\u2019s 200 vacancies at the trust. They can\u2019t get people from the EU,\u201d he said.\nJohn Sheard, a retired IT worker, said Brexit was the first issue he had protested against since he was a student and went on a demonstration against grant cuts. Both he and Gosling are Labour members and campaigned for their local party to submit a motion to Labour conference in favour of a second referendum: a move eventually backed by Creagh.\n\u201cI thought it was a positive thing, Corbyn being Eurosceptic,\u201d Sheard said. \u201cI thought we could remain in the EU and have a Eurosceptic leader who would be a strong voice for a reform in Europe. But it\u2019s not been how it worked out.\u201d\nLynne Stainthorpe, a retired teacher, said she had been campaigning since the People\u2019s Vote march in October. \u201cMost Labour members are remainers, aren\u2019t they, and most Labour MPs are remainers,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted him to see that.\u201d",

        "content": "The Academy Awards looks set to feature a calvacade of stars instead of a single host. What a nightmare\nCould it be that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to imitate the BBC\u2019s Film \u2026 in its final painful incarnation? As it shuffled towards oblivion, that TV show decided in its last series not to have a single presenter, but a rolling, changing roster of guest hosts. The result was blandness and uncertainty.\nNow, for Oscar night, the Academy is itself pivoting towards hostlessness.\nBruised by the Kevin Hart debacle \u2013 in which that planned presenter was dropped for refusing to apologise afresh for past homophobic comments \u2013 and after what was clearly a subsequent low-morale interlude in which the poisoned chalice was then refused by every comic in town, the Academy is engaging in a radical experiment with communal compering.\nOut goes the grinning single MC or MC pairing, in comes a phased cavalcade of stars, a terrifyingly under-rehearsed Avengers Assemble of A-listers introducing various segments. This would be in addition to the traditional, awkward, guest-presenter pairings for awarding the actual statuettes.\nWhen are the Oscars?\nThe 91st Academy awards take place on 24 February at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. It is broadcast live on ABC in the US, on Sky in the UK, and on Channel Nine in Australia. The red carpet portion of the show is broadcast live by the E! network.\nWho decides on the Oscars?\nThe Oscars are voted for by members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (aka Ampas), which currently numbers just under 8,000 voting members, divided into 17 separate branches, including actors, directors, costume designers, etc. (To join, names have to be proposed and approved by individual branches.) The Academy has received considerable criticism in recent years for the perceived white/male/elderly bias of its voters \u2013 and a drive to create a more diverse membership was instituted after the #OscarsSoWhite campaign in 2016.\n\nHow many Oscars are there and how does a film get nominated?\nThere are 24 categories \u2013 ranging from best picture to best sound mixing \u2013 presented on Oscar night. The Academy also gives out a bunch of Scientific and Technical awards: this year, for example, it will honour the people behind Adobe Photoshop and the Medusa Performance Capture System. Also there are the honorary Oscars: this year they are going to actor Cicely Tyson, producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, Steven Spielberg's PR flack Marvin Levy and composer Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible renown).\nEach of the main awards has its own rules and regulations for slimming down all the eligible entries \u2013 first to a longlist, then a shortlist, then the final nomination list. In most categories, to be eligible a film must have been released for seven days in Los Angeles before 31 December, and a specialist committee makes the selection for the nomination \u2013 which is then voted on by the full membership. For the best foreign language film award, each country can submit one film (89 were put forward this year), before a committee boils them down to a final five.\u00a0\nWhat do Oscar winners win?\nThe Oscar statuette isn't solid gold:\u00a0it's gold-plated bronze on a black metal base. It is 34 cm tall and weighs 3.8 kg. While the Academy doesn't own it once it is handed over, its acceptance is conditional that recipients won't sell them unless they have offered them back to the Academy for $1.\u00a0\nWhat a nightmare it sounds: an exponential increase of audience unease and megastar self-love, slowing down the show\u2019s momentum and pace. None of these big names will be allowed to develop audience rapport. Nor will the audience be allowed the reassurance of a single thread of continuity \u2013 what with all of these egos having to be rolled on and off stage during musical breaks, like 18-wheeler pantechnicons being negotiated in and out of a pub car park.\nI was in the audience at the Oscars a couple of years ago, when Warren Beatty contrived to award the best picture gong to the wrong nominee, causing dismay and consternation and creating a brand new conspiracy industry about the whole thing being deliberately cooked up to boost TV ratings. All of these segment hosts will be terrified of a similar cockup and an eternity of shame on YouTube.\nOf course, it could be argued that discomfort and embarrassment is part of the Oscar night tradition \u2013 cherished and amplified in the age of social media when those at home can be a snarky Joan Rivers, jeering at every limp gag and fashion fail.\nI myself have blogged about the tradition of the wooden award presenters, often in their weird newsreader-pairing of an older man and a younger woman. The most legendary example being Roger Moore and Liv Ullmann in 1973, exchanging stilted, scripted conversation before trying and failing to give the best actor Oscar to Marlon Brando for The Godfather.\nAnd there is also the argument that the host plummets in interest anyway after the all-important opening monologue. Once that is out of the way, the audience is sometimes irritated to see the host keep coming back, unless they have a huge stunt up their sleeves, such as Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s famed star selfie.\nThere\u2019s no getting round it: group host or no group host, who\u2019s doing the opening monologue? Who\u2019s doing the gags about Donald Trump\u2019s federal shutdown? About Brexit? About Putin? About Kevin Spacey\u2019s bizarre in-character video as Frank Underwood? Or indeed the gags about Kevin Hart not doing the gags? Or is there to be no opening monologue \u2013 just an extended satirical musical spoof of this year\u2019s movies? Either way, the hostless Oscars could be a gang show of grisliness.",

He now suffers chronic pain and mobility issues and is unable to find work.\nLives: Lakes Entrance, Victoria\nAfter housing costs, has to live on: $245 a week\nThe old saying goes \u201cdoing the right thing is never easy\u201d, and while this has been one of the most difficult times of my life \u2013 full of tragedy, trauma, pain, anger and disbelief \u2013 to rise above it and fight to do the right thing regardless of personal cost also makes it one of the most rewarding times of my life.\n In November I spoke via teleconference during a Senate inquiry into employment services system Jobactive, recollecting my various experiences with employment providers, Centrelink, my injuries during work for the dole and how they have changed my life. How they left me with mobility issues, physical limitation and pain, robbed of dignity and self-worth while battling to correct and avoid countless cases of clerical error that often resulted in payment suspensions, demerits, all while unable to afford specialist health services, let alone cover rent, bills, fuel and food, all without ever receiving so much as an apology, any accountability, or even the recognition of my ongoing physical and mental health issues for the last three years.\nIn mid-November my partner Marnie and I moved into our friend\u2019s spare room \u2013 a temporary situation until we find an affordable rental or someone willing to sell us a caravan cheaply. However life had different plans. Our friend\u2019s pet and emotional support companion Phoebe \u2013 a four-year-old red kelpie rescued from a sheep farm \u2013 was hit by a car just a week after we had moved in. We were unpacking when we heard the dreaded \u201cbang-crash-yelp\u201d as she was struck.\n With the help of neighbours, we rushed her to the local vet, but regional services are mostly unprepared and ill-equipped for both animal and human trauma cases. Even the local hospital doesn\u2019t carry blood, and there being no transportation service to the nearest after-hours emergency animal hospital four hours away, the only option was to leave her to be stabilised and monitored overnight, returning home with our friend to wash the blood from our face and clothes, shaken, worried and powerless.\nMarnie and I are animal lovers, somewhat fresh from the trauma of losing her puppy who was hit by a car not too long ago, which is partially why we were so driven to help our friend, apart from the fact it was also the right thing to do. Coincidentally we had arrived just when we were needed most, since our friend cannot drive long distances or at night due to epilepsy and her medications, so first thing next morning with my walking cane, pain meds and a water bottle at the ready, we made the four-hour drive into Melbourne to save her pup.\nAll too familiar financial barriers went into play that somewhat mirrored my own experiences, as our friend had to call friends, family and various pet charities to cover the cost for her admission, surgery and aftercare, scrounging and begging in order to save a life. Meanwhile I had emptied my bank account to cover food and transport, and Marnie had to take out an advance payment to pay for a hotel across from the vet for two night\u2019s stay, since my back couldn\u2019t handle the constant back-and-forth travel and it took us that long to negotiate costs, even to the point where I offered my vehicle as collateral.\nCome mid-December, Marnie received a trial-by-fire shift at the local hotel bistro \u2013 her first potential job in almost two years since moving to Victoria. After rave reviews she has been working there for over a month now, through the holidays, trying to get ahead and save, dig our way out of the poverty trap, as it\u2019s called.\n While during the holiday season we were unable to afford gift giving, or to travel and see family, the new year brings new possibilities and with it a huge silver lining. Six weeks into Phoebe\u2019s recovery, she is our happy, healthy, somewhat disabled little girl, able to play, eat and go to the bathroom on her own. She has even adapted to mobility on two legs, though she still requires a fair amount of work, supervision, feeding, bathing, diaper changes and physiotherapy. Still, we helped to save a life and that is no small feat.\n An unforeseen consequence of Marnie working through the holidays means we no longer receive full benefits. So she basically works to fill the gap on what we would be earning if she was unemployed, which is a fairly strange realisation, however the consensus seems to be that social security payments are designed as a safety net to catch you before you hit rock bottom, not to help you climb your way back out of the hole.\nThis month has helped to concrete a rather sad realisation: that often \u201cwe\u201d as a society are willing to let those of lower social standing suffer based on class, status, appearance and the contents of their bank account, balancing the value of one life over another. This one example with Phoebe highlights a situation where regardless of there being the staff, equipment, means and resources, she suffered because money is the ultimate motivator and often trumps morality.\nMeanwhile, I continue chasing specialist services through the public health system, delaying multiple surgeries and continuing my own treatment regime. I\u2019ve been working on 3D design and animation materials for the Australian Unemployed Workers\u2019 Union, taught myself to sew, and created a custom-designed harness and temporary wheelchair for Phoebe from parts found at the local tip.\nIt has been good to feel useful, relied upon and devoted to helping our fuzzy friend despite being sleep-deprived. Nothing worth doing is ever easy, and everyone deserves a chance at health and happiness.",

The fourth suspect was identified according to German court custom as Dennis W.\nIf found guilty the suspects face up to 10 years in prison and will have to pay back the value of the coin.\nProsecutors assume that the coin \u2013 53cm in diameter and 3cm thick, embossed with the head of Queen Elizabeth II and produced by the Canadian Royal Mint in 2007 \u2013 will never be recovered, having likely been broken up and melted down soon after its seizure.\nUnknown perpetrators at a later stage broke into a police car park and sprayed foam from a fire extinguisher inside the getaway vehicle, possibly trying to obscure forensic traces. However, a police team discovered gold particles inside the vehicle matching the purity of the Big Maple Leaf, according to prosecutors.\nA police detective who gave evidence described his surprise after being called to the museum shortly after 6am to investigate the theft of a coin, \u201cassuming it was, well, just a coin that was missing\u201d.\nHe said that on taking a closer look at the plaque next to the broken display case he discovered \u201cthat it was in fact a 100kg coin\u201d, drawing stifled laughter from the courtroom.\nDressed predominantly in grey and black, the men, who arrived in court covering their faces from the waiting media with magazines with peepholes cut into them, spoke only to confirm their names and addresses and to describe their employment status. Three said they were either in education or apprenticeships, and one said he was working as a courier.\nJudge Dorothee Pr\u00fcfer noted the men\u2019s decision to remain silent through the trial but said they could change their minds at any point, and emphasised that their decision would not alter the outcome.\nTwo members of the nine-strong legal team representing the men told the court they did not expect their clients to receive a fair trial, referring to the evidence against them as more circumstantial than fact based.\n\u201cDespite the huge effort in their investigations, including a special commission, 50 telephone surveillance operations and mobile phone site analysis, 30 house searches and the deployment of sniffer dogs, the evidence collected is scant\u201d and had produced \u201cnot a single piece of drastic proof\u201d for the complicity of any of the four in the crime, Toralf N\u00f6ding, representing Wayci Remmo, told the court.\nHe said the prosecution case was based mainly on anonymous tipoffs and the questionable bioforensic analysis of CCTV footage of the three brothers at a Berlin train station, which allegedly showed the suspects but not their faces.\nStefan Conen, representing Wissam Remmo, accused the media of condemning the men ahead of the trial by reporting on the family\u2019s link to organised crime. He said as a result of the association, the police investigation had also been \u201cone-sided\u201d, and based on anonymous tipoffs from possible family rivals.\nThe trial, which is taking place in a youth chamber of Berlin\u2019s regional court due to the fact that the men were adolescents at the time of the crime, is expected to continue until the spring.\nThe gold coin was marketed as the world\u2019s largest by the Canadian Royal Mint, which said it had a face value of C$1m and could be used as legal tender.\nNext up in the witness stand will be the head of security at the Bode Museum, part of Berlin\u2019s museum island, one of the city\u2019s biggest attractions and a Unesco world heritage site.\nThe museum, which has one of the world\u2019s biggest coin collections with more than half a million objects, has come under huge pressure to explain how it was that its alarm system was not triggered on the night of the theft and why an on-duty security guard headed into the museum\u2019s cellar precisely at the time the crime was being carried out.",

Isis is a banned organisation in Russia and media outlets are barred from publishing the statements of its leaders or supporters.\n\u201cChecks are underway into whether the BBC\u2019s internet sites comply with Russian law. To date, material has been uncovered which transmits the ideological principles of a terrorist group,\u201d the regulator said in a statement on Thursday. \n  The investigation by Roskomnadzor into the BBC World News channel and BBC websites, both of which are available in Russia, was launched in late December. It was announced just hours after the British media regulator, Ofcom, said that RT, the Kremlin-funded broadcaster, had broken impartiality rules over its reports on the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Ofcom is considering sanctions against RT that could include large fines or even the loss of its licence to broadcast in Britain.\n  Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, confirmed in December that the investigation into the BBC was a response to Ofcom\u2019s report. The foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said Britain\u2019s actions against RT left Russia with no option but to respond. \u201cRussia had given warning. Repeatedly,\u201d she wrote on Facebook last year.\n  The Roskomnadzor investigation was accompanied by a list of BBC reporters working in Russia, along with their photographs, which was leaked online last month. The list, which was publicised by nationalist websites, concerned 44 BBC reporters, most of them Russian citizens. The move appears to have been retaliation for an article published by the Sunday Times that named eight reporters working for the Kremlin-backed Sputnik website in Edinburgh. Russian officials said the Sunday Times article put the Sputnik reporters in danger.\n  The BBC\u2019s Russian-language service has expanded significantly in recent years. It has published investigative reports into a number of sensitive topics, including the identities of the Salisbury suspects, as well as the activities of Wagner, a private military contractor reportedly run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked businessman. Many of the reporters employed by the BBC had worked at Russian newspapers or websites that had come under pressure from the Kremlin, which continues to crack down on critical reporting.",

It was his vision and dogged negotiating skills that brought about the Henry Moore Institute on the Headrow.\nAs a newly elected Conservative councillor and the party\u2019s spokesman on leisure services, he had the idea of establishing such a prestigious gallery in Leeds. He was initially rebuffed by both parties but he set about gathering influential support until it was eventually accepted.\nHis tactic was to persuade Moore that his foundation should endow the gallery. Sherwin put together a small group of councillors who entertained Moore for a series of lunches. The Henry Moore Foundation duly provided a key \u00a3100,000 grant, and Moore himself laid the foundation stone on 10 April 1980.\nSherwin was very much a Leeds man, born in the city, undertaking his medical studies at Leeds University and establishing himself as much loved GP in the Harehills area. His mother, Rachel (nee Hyams), was a housewife; his father was also a doctor, qualifying under the original family name of Morris Shernovitch before changing it to Maurice Sherwin in the early 1920s.\nJeffrey qualified in 1961 and joined his father\u2019s practice. In 1968 he married Ruth Israel, a talented pianist studying music in Leeds. He continued working as a GP, but began his political career in 1963, as a Liberal, contesting the Wortley ward unsuccessfully. He later switched to the Conservatives, winning a council seat at his first attempt in 1971 and remaining on the city council until 1980. He was later made an honorary alderman.\nSherwin was a loud, brash and almost unembarrassable force of nature. He followed the Henry Moore Institute by seeking to solve the city\u2019s lack of an adequate concert hall by proposing the adaptation of the Victorian Corn Exchange. He got Leeds Civic Trust to support the Corn Exchange scheme but it was rejected by the city council.\nHe was a knowledgable art collector, possessing works by Jacob Kramer, John Bratby and Moore, but it was his passion for the English surrealists, on which he wrote the book British Surrealism Opened Up (2014), that established his reputation as a noted expert.\nAnother curious early enthusiasm was for the Morris Minor car and he once drove a Morris 1,000 convertible to Moscow.\nHe is survived by Ruth and his sons, Jonathan and Adam.",

        "content": "Loans lasting up to 40 years can leave buyers unable to save for pension, say regulators\nFirst-time buyers are taking out jumbo loans on longer terms that will leave four in 10 borrowers paying off their mortgage well into retirement, regulators have warned.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that 40% of borrowers who took out a mortgage in 2017 will be aged over 65 when their mortgage matures \u2013 leaving them unable to save for a pension, and vulnerable to any financial shocks.\nThe 40% figure represents a huge change over the last five years. As recently as 2012, just 22% of mortgages were expected to run into the borrower\u2019s retirement. But that number has nearly doubled as buyers stretch themselves to pay for escalating house prices.\nHistorically, buyers have taken out 25-year mortgages to pay for their home, and in 2007 the 25-year term was still the most common deal. But the FCA found that 30-year terms have now become the norm, with 34% of loans taken out in 2017 lasting 30 years or more.\nMost lenders now allow mortgages of 35 years, while Halifax and Nationwide, the two biggest lenders, will offer loans with 40-year repayment terms.\nMany first-time buyers are also delaying a purchase until they are in their 30s as they save to afford the deposit.\nIn a grim assessment of the financial health of UK households, the FCA warned that the burden of a mortgage throughout people\u2019s working lives is likely to limit their ability to save for a pension and deal with financial shocks.\n\u201cA range of factors, including subdued earnings growth, changing working patterns, increasing household debt and lower saving rates suggest many households may lack financial resilience to withstand financial shocks,\u201d it said in its 2019 Sector Views on how the financial system is working as a whole.\nPension expert Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe big challenge is: how are people going to be able to service this debt past the age of 65? This phenomenon of running debt into later life is now becoming the norm, whereas before more people were able to clear their debts by their late 50s or early 60s.\n\u201cBut young people are coming to the conclusion that to afford a home they have to commit to paying for debt through their 60s and into their 70s. It\u2019s a significant risk, especially if your health starts deteriorating. Many people retire early not because they want or can afford to, but because they have to.\u201d\nThe FCA also highlighted the increasing number of mortgages taken out on high multiples of the borrower\u2019s income.\nIt said that loan-to-income ratios (LTIs) continue to increase. \u201cOver 25% of mortgages now have an LTI of greater than four times income, with an increasing number of loans near the banks\u2019 4.5 times LTI flow limit.\u201d\nMortgage broker Jonathan Harris, of Anderson Harris, said: \u201cThe rising age of first-time buyers means many people don\u2019t get on the housing ladder until their late 30s, so the chances of having paid back the mortgage by state retirement age are increasingly slim.\n\u201cRising house prices mean people are having to take on bigger mortgages but this is less of a concern if you are still earning, can ultimately sell up and downsize and still have a decent property to live in. First-time buyers rarely go for 25-year terms now but opt for longer ones, and can always overpay and try to clear the loan more quickly as they can afford to do so.\u201d",

He told the board after the group\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting that he had concluded \u201cit is no longer possible\u201d to remain on the board without the backing of key shareholders.\nBucher is to stay on as the board said it had \u201cfull confidence in Sergio and in the management\u2019s plan to reshape the business\u201d.\n\u201cThe board believes that it is in the best interests of Debenhams plc that the executive team remains fully focused on delivery of the plan. In the meantime, the board remains open to constructive suggestions from shareholders that are in the interests of the business as a whole.\u201d\nCheshire, a former boss of the B&Q owner, Kingfisher, said: \u201cIn unprecedented market conditions the team has worked incredibly hard to build a format for the future and a comprehensive plan to reshape the business, which will put Debenhams on the road to recovery and future success. Whilst it is right that I step down today, I wish the team at Debenhams every success in the future\u201d.\nThe dramatic events came after weeks of pressure for change at Debenhams from Ashley as the debt-laden store chain struggles to turn around a slump in sales and profits.\nAshley wants a closer relationship between Debenhams and his struggling House of Fraser department store chain \u2013 which Sports Direct bought out of administration in August.\nEarlier Debenhams had reported sales at established UK stores were down 6.2% in the 18 weeks to 5 January. The company said it still expected to meet profit targets \u2013 but only after \u00a330m of additional cost savings, starting with a hiring freeze at its head office and the earlier than planned closure of its Lodge Farm distribution centre in Northamptonshire.\nDebenhams said it had started talks with its bankers about refinancing. The group has put on hold its plan to raise cash by selling its Danish Magasin du Nord chain after failing to receive strong enough offers.\nThe company said it had not ruled out any options, include an insolvency process that could be used to speed up a plan to close up to 50 stores over the next five years. It currently has 165 UK stores.",

        "content": "The acting teacher and coach Jennie Buckman, who has died of cancer aged 69, spent 21 years at the London drama school Rada, where she became head of acting.\nIt is hard these days to go to the theatre, or sit in the cinema or in front of a TV drama series and not find yourself watching one of her former students, among them Sophie Okonedo, Adrian Lester, Matthew Macfadyen, Andrea Riseborough, Tom Hiddleston and Ben Whishaw. \u201cShe\u2019s my girl\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s my boy,\u201d Jennie would declare with pride.\nJennie was also a playwright and director and, in her last decade, through her company Giants, she devised innovative ways of working with people whose voices are rarely heard in theatre: from Iranian and Kurdish women to members of the Irish Traveller community, military veterans, prisoners and council workers.\nBorn in London to a Jewish family originally from the East End, Jennie was the youngest of three children of Irene (nee Amiel), a lawyer, and Bernard Buckman, a businessman. She was brought up in an environment in which stage and writing were paramount. In 1963 her mother published Twenty Tales from Shakespeare, which encouraged Jennie on her path.\nAt South Hampstead high school, theatre became Jennie\u2019s realm. After a weekend trip to Stratford upon Avon, where her passion for Shakespeare was deepened and her critical skills honed, she would enlighten us less knowledgable classmates with her shrewd observations.\nMidweek she might be found with a five-shilling standing ticket watching a more contemporary play \u2013 A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, or Roots, perhaps \u2013 after which she would explain with absolute clarity what worked or could be improved.\nShe developed her directing and coaching talent (as well as her prodigious sense of humour) at school, where she started a lunchtime drama club. She went to Kent University in 1968 to study English and American literature, returning to London in 1971 to train as a teacher. For eight years she taught English and drama in comprehensive schools, encouraging students to write and produce their own plays.\nIn 1979 Jennie joined Common Stock, a community theatre company dedicated to collaborative practice and improvisation techniques, to set up their youth theatre. Together with Chattie Salaman and Frank Whitten, she evolved the working method she would take further at Giants. In 1982 she also directed Jemma Redgrave in a youth theatre production of The Caucasian Chalk Circle at the Lyric Hammersmith. In 1984 she became artistic director.\nChattie introduced Jennie to her son Nick Blatchley, who became Jennie\u2019s partner. They had three children, Michael, Zoe, and Joshua; and Jennie became stepmother to Joseph, Nick\u2019s son by a previous marriage. They married in 1991.\nJennie had moved back into teaching and coaching in 1985 and over the next few years worked with the National Theatre, Guildhall School of Speech and Drama and Rose Bruford College, among others.\nShe was renowned for her nonconformist and inclusive approach which, with her wicked sense of fun, created a refreshingly open and liberating environment for her students. Keen to keep improving her own skills, she took acting classes with Doreen Cannon, adapting Cannon\u2019s insights on Stanislavski\u2019s techniques to her own teaching methods.\nWhen Cannon moved to Rada as head of acting in 1986, she invited Jennie to join her. Jennie was to work at Rada as acting teacher, stage director and, from 2003, as head of acting.\nWhile at Rada, Jennie began writing her own plays, starting in 1999 for BBC Radio, for whom she wrote more than 60 episodes of the World Service drama Westway, as well as numerous plays for Radio 4, including Goodbye Moses (1999), about a restless West Indian spirit; The Slap (2000), an autobiographical coming-of-age story about matriarchy, Jewish culture and feminism; and Deptford Wives (2002), based on an 18th-century autobiography by a female shipwright and starring her sister-in-law Geraldine James.\nIn 2002 she also wrote a series for Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, Ten Days That Shook My World, based on time previously spent in Cuba, which she revisited in 2007 to work with Ulises Rodr\u00edguez Febles on Cuba Mi Amor, which was nominated for best radio play that year.\nIn 2007 Jennie left Rada and in the following year founded Giants theatre company, becoming its artistic director. Giants represented the fruition of 40 years\u2019 work. Using her empathetic approach and collaborating with overlooked groups, the company produced plays to reach new audiences and change the lives of those who entrusted her with their stories.\nOne of her early pieces for Giants, Pandora, staged in 2010 at the Arcola theatre in Hackney, resulted from work with older women and young teenagers from Haringey exploring what ills might come out of Pandora\u2019s box today. In SNAFU (2016), she drew on Homer\u2019s Odyssey to encourage and enable military personnel and their families to talk about their experiences of coming home after war, both good and bad.\nIn 2016 the award-winning Piece of Silk, staged at the Hope theatre in Islington, evolved out of discussions with female survivors of domestic violence and forced marriage.\nNever Going to Beat You, developed with women from the organisation The Traveller Movement, also explored domestic abuse and has been adapted for film. Jennie\u2019s final play, Lilith, completed shortly before her death, explores the grief of stillbirth.\nWhen not writing or coaching, Jennie would often be found at the theatre, particularly if new writing or Shakespeare were involved. She was a fantastic wit and entertainer and enjoyed reducing friends to tears of laughter. But what she most loved was to spend time with her family round the kitchen table, preferably at a meal prepared by Nick.\nHe and their children and nine grandchildren survive her, as does her older brother, Peter.\n Jennifer Margaret Amiel Buckman, teacher, acting coach and playwright, born 24 September 1949; died 4 January 2019",

        "content": "Seawater temperature is rising faster than predicted, which is likely to worsen extreme weather events around the world\nThe world\u2019s oceans are warming at a faster rate than previously estimated, new research has found, raising fresh concerns over the rapid progress of climate change.\nWarming oceans take up more space, a process known as thermal expansion, which the study says is likely to raise sea levels by about 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the rise in sea levels from melting ice and glaciers. Warmer oceans are also a major factor in increasing the severity of storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall.\nOceans store heat so effectively that it would take decades for them to cool down, even in the unlikely scenario that greenhouse gas emissions were halted urgently.\nThe report, published on Thursday in the journal Science, found that the warming of the oceans was accelerating and was matching the predictions of climate change models, which have shown global temperature rises are likely to lead to extreme weather across the world.\nZeke Hausfather, co-author of the paper and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: \u201cWhile 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the [earth\u2019s] surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. The global warming signal is a lot easier to detect if it is changing in the oceans than on the surface.\u201d\nOceans absorb more than nine-tenths of the excess energy trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, and play a key role in regulating the world\u2019s climate.\nBut the role of oceans in the global climate system was overlooked for many years, in part because of a lack of data and the difficulty of studying the marine environment. Only in recent years have scientists come to realise the full importance of oceans, which have effectively absorbed much of the impact of climate change in recent decades, but are now understood to be reaching their capacity as a buffer.\nSeparate recently published research extrapolated temperature estimates for the oceans for the past 150 years, and found substantial warming.\nPublished in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, that research found the total heat taken up by the oceans in the last century and a half was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the world\u2019s population.\nA Guardian analysis of those findings suggested that the amount of energy absorbed by the oceans was equivalent to an atomic bomb per second for the past 150 years. Scientists said this was unsustainable in the long term without seeing further massive effects, including extreme weather, fiercer storms, and sea level rises.\nThe heating could also affect sea currents around the world, with unpredictable consequences.\nLate last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world would face dire effects from global warming from 2030 unless urgent and drastic measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe new Science paper analysed four studies published between 2014 and 2017, which corrected for discrepancies between different types of ocean temperature measurements and gaps in measurements.\nSatellite monitoring, buoys and ships are all used to gather data on the effect of climate change on the oceans. In the past decade, a network of 4,000 buoys known as Argo has provided an unprecedented data set on the temperature, salinity and acidification of oceans.\nBy taking the four studies, with different methodologies, into consideration the authors of the new analysis were able to build a fuller picture than was previously possible, with calculations extrapolated back to the 1970s.",

        "content": "Poppy and Bryony Cleall have played together \u2013 and against each other \u2013 since the age of six and this weekend will be side by side in a top-of-the-table clash\nAs kids, Poppy and Bryony Cleall always sat back-to-back when they were unwrapping their birthday presents so they wouldn\u2019t spoil the surprise if they were both given the same things. This stuff is always tricky for twins. Like the time Bryony got picked for England Under-18s but Poppy didn\u2019t, or Poppy made the under-20s but Bryony was left out. Then there were the years they played for competing teams: Poppy was at Saracens while Bryony was at Bristol, and Poppy was at Bristol while Bryony was at Saracens. Just last week, when the RFU announced its first batch of permanent full-time contracts, Poppy got one but Bryony did not.\nBryony is still in the England elite player squad, but will carry on in her day job as the head of girls\u2019 PE at the Harris City Academy in Crystal Palace. \u201cPoppy\u2019s never even asked me if I\u2019m OK about not getting a full-time contract,\u201d Bryony teases. She is. She missed five years of her career because of injuries which is why she is a step behind her sister. Bryony has not played for England yet but Poppy made her debut in 2016 and now has 24 caps. \u201cThe email that told me I was in the elite player squad said at the bottom of it: \u2018I know you may be disappointed by this\u2019 but I was over the moon. I rang Poppy and I shouted: \u2018Woohoo! I got in!\u2019 I\u2019m proud just to be involved.\u201d\nThe twins started playing when they were six. Their brother Josh used to play in an after-school rugby club, Poppy explains, \u201cbut Mum and Dad would come and pick us up all together at four o\u2019clock so we had to wait around and watch until one day the coach said: \u2018Do you two want to come and play?\u2019 We\u2019ve been at it ever since.\u201d\nSometimes they were playing with each other, sometimes against. Once they were on opposite sides in the Premiership semi-final. \u201cDad was like: \u2018It\u2019s OK, at least one Cleall will be in the final,\u2019\u201d Poppy says. Bryony cuts in: \u201cThen she got injured and missed it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cPoppy will hate me for saying this,\u201d Bryony says, \u201cbut my favourite story is the time she pulled my hair. It should have been a red card. I was with the ball and she went to tackle me and got a fistful of my hair. She let go and went: \u2018Oh my God! I\u2019m so sorry!\u2019\u201d\nNow they are back playing together at Saracens. This Saturday Sarries, the leaders of the Women\u2019s Premier15 table, are playing Harlequins, who are second. Poppy is recovering from an injury but says she\u2019ll be fit, if picked, for the latest round of what is becoming one of the league\u2019s defining rivalries. \u201cIt extends beyond the pitch,\u201d Bryony says. \u201cQuins are definitely pushing women\u2019s rugby to the forefront and so are Sarries. Both clubs want to be the number one draw in women\u2019s rugby.\u201d\nLately the twins have been working together too. Poppy\u2019s new contract means Bryony is going to have to find a new coach for Harris City\u2019s under-18s team. Poppy took on the job when she moved back to London. But, as of 1 January, she is a full-time pro. \u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege that we can be the first ever professionals,\u201d Poppy says, \u201cand it\u2019s a little bit of pressure, too.\u201d She has been a professional before, briefly, when the RFU gave the women full-time contracts before the last World Cup \u2013 but scrapped them when the tournament was over. \u201cPeople just always ask me how come Poppy\u2019s skinnier than me,\u201d Bryony says, \u201cand I always say it\u2019s because she went professional four years ago.\u201d\nBefore that Poppy worked as a prison officer. \u201cAnyone that can juggle a sporting career and a job, hats off,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it was so stressful and some days it really did get me down.\u201d She used up her holiday allowance taking time off to play games on the weekends. \u201cI remember one weekend when our manager told me I had to play but I just couldn\u2019t get it off work. In the end I told her I\u2019d play so long as she didn\u2019t put my name on the teamsheet. Lo and behold I scored a hat-trick, and on Monday morning my name was right there at the top. Two days later at work they were like: \u2018You know when you rang in sick at the weekend? How do you explain this?\u201d\nShe felt like she was always letting somebody down, either her coaches or her bosses. It was always \u201csorry I can\u2019t train because I\u2019ve got work, or sorry I can\u2019t work I\u2019ve got to play\u201d. Bryony is lucky as the school allows her some flexibility. But she is still painfully aware of the problems her playing career causes for her teaching colleagues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the work I leave behind, it\u2019s really a burden for the department to have to pick up the load I\u2019m missing.\u201d For years, this was just the way it was if you were a woman who wanted to play international rugby. \u201cYou just put your head down and get on with it,\u201d Poppy says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got to make the sacrifices.\u201d\nIt should not be that way. And now, at last, it is not. \u201cThe women\u2019s game has taken a big step in the right direction,\u201d Bryony says. \u201cI would have loved to have that first professional contract but I think it\u2019s really more important for kids who are six years old now who can pick up a ball and think \u2018actually, I want to be professional\u2019 not \u2018I want to play rugby and do some other job for a living\u2019 but \u2018my dream is to be a professional rugby player\u2019.\u201d Poppy agrees: \u201cThat\u2019s the history that\u2019s being written now, we\u2019re living a dream that all the little girls who come after us can have from the start.\u201d",

        "content": "Shinz\u014d Abe says \u2018the whole world\u2019 wants the UK to secure an agreement\nJapan\u2019s prime minister has implored the UK not to leave the EU without an exit deal, saying it was \u201cthe wish of the whole world\u201d to see Britain secure an agreement.\nThe remarks from Shinz\u014d Abe on a visit to London came as two cabinet ministers, Greg Clark and Gavin Williamson, traded blows over the viability of a no-deal.\nSpeaking in Downing Street, Abe said Japan offered total support to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and said Japanese companies employing 150,000 people in the UK would value the stability.\n\u201cIt is the strong will of Japan to further develop this strong partnership with the UK, to invest more into your country and to enjoy further economic growth with the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we truly hope that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, and in fact that is the wish of the whole world.\u201d\nAbe, a world leader who has developed one of the closest relationships with May, praised the \u201cstrong will and hard work\u201d of the prime minister leading up to next week\u2019s parliamentary vote on the deal.\nA draft plan to sell the Brexit deal that was leaked in November even suggested that Abe might be persuaded to tweet to support May\u2019s deal, although in person in London the Japanese prime minister went further.\n\u201cJapan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and Prime Minister May, which provides for transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country,\u201d Abe said.\nMay said that Abe had committed to reaching an ambitious bilateral trade agreement after Brexit, and said that the UK was interested in pursuing membership of the CPTPP free trade alliance of Pacific countries.\nThe carefully crafted remarks from Abe represent the latest attempt to try to persuade sceptical MPs to support May\u2019s Brexit deal next Tuesday, although few believe his intervention will make much of a dent in the majority of MPs who have said they are opposed to the deal.\nThe comments from the Japanese leader came after an impassioned intervention from Clark, the business secretary, who broke ranks with his cabinet colleagues and urged MPs to work together to block a no-deal Brexit.\nClark said leaving with no deal would cause \u201cincalculable damage\u201d to business and the economy. The business secretary has argued for a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d on options including a second referendum or a Norway-style deal, in order to establish which choice could command the backing of the most MPs.\n\u201cIt is my strong view that we need to come together. We need to act to avoid a no-deal because I don\u2019t think there is anything remotely like a majority in parliament that will tolerate this,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\nClark warned there was a danger the country could \u201cfall into\u201d a no deal unless MPs voted for an alternative. \u201cThe default is in law that unless we have a deal, then we will fall into no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat parliament needs to do is recognise that we need to put differences aside and establish agreement on a deal. It is something that has to involve the whole of parliament.\n\u201cIt seems to me, to move from parliament being just a scrutineer, but to be active participants and that means discovering parliament\u2019s mind,\u201d he said.\nClark hinted he would resign if the government actively pursued no deal; the justice secretary David Gauke has also suggested a similar course of action. Others who would be likely to walk include the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd.\nWilliamson later directly contradicted Clark\u2019s remarks and said the UK should be bullish about no deal.\nAsked by Sky News if he agreed with Clark\u2019s comments, the defence secretary said: \u201cNot at all, Britain has always been a nation that will always achieve and always deliver. We can be optimistic and confident. Whatever is our future, Britain will succeed and do incredibly well.\u201d",

        "content": "Weak consumer demand prompts department store chain to consider scrapping bonus for first time since 1953\nJohn Lewis is considering suspending its staff bonus for the first time in 66 years in the wake of the worst Christmas for retailers since the depths of the financial crisis.\nThe employee-owned department store group, which also owns Waitrose, said it would \u201cneed to consider carefully \u2026 whether payment of a bonus is prudent in the light of business and economic prospects at that time\u201d.\nJohn Lewis\u2019s warning came amid a slew of downbeat trading updates from some of the best-known names in the retail sector on what had been billed as \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d.\nMarks & Spencer and Debenhams reported a slump in sales over the crucial trading period and Halfords fired off a profit warning that wiped a fifth off the company\u2019s value.\nWhat\u2019s the problem?\nPhysical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as the coronavirus pandemic. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.\nIn terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u00a0\nAt the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit and the coronavirus, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.\nWhat help do retailers need?\nRetailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers. Many businesses which deal with complex supply chains also want additional help with the new red tape and import charges imposed after Boris Johnson's Brexit deal saddled them with extra costs.\nWhat is the government doing?\nIn the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.\n\u201cThese results show no abatement in the crisis of the high street,\u201d said David Marshall, professor of marketing and consumer behaviour at the University of Edinburgh business school.\n\u201cHigh street footfall is down and price incentives do not appear to have attracted customers back into stores,\u201d he said. \u201cOnline retail now accounts for one-fifth of retail sales and is likely to continue to increase as a proportion.\u201d\nRetailers\u2019 profits are under pressure as they have been forced to discount heavily to win over nervous shoppers, spooked by political and economic uncertainty around Brexit. Shoppers have reined in spending on non-essentials amid fears for jobs and savings.\nIn December, official sales data showed online sales accounted for more than a fifth of total spending for the first time, underlining the challenge faced by bricks-and-mortar retailers in an increasingly digital age.\nA report published on Thursday by the British Retail Consortium showed that in non-food sales more than 31% of trade has now moved to the internet.\nEarlier this month the music and film retailer HMV called in administrators, blaming rising costs and falling sales. The Queen\u2019s former dressmaker Hardy Amies and the upmarket slipper brand Mahabis have also fallen into administration in recent weeks.\nClothing retailers including Asos, Superdry and Bonmarch\u00e9 have issued profit warnings while Mothercare and Next admitted trading had been tough.\nPatrick Lewis, finance director of the John Lewis Partnership, said the group could afford to pay a modest bonus but would wait until March to decide on the payout because of the \u201cunusual economic circumstances\u201d and a \u201chigher level of volatility\u201d around Brexit.\nThe company warned that profits would be substantially lower this year \u2013 despite a last-minute rush that eventually resulted in higher Christmas sales than last year \u2013 as a result of heavy discounting by rivals and weak consumer demand. While profits are expected to rise at Waitrose, they will be down sharply at the John Lewis department stores chain, mainly because of its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d policy of matching high street rivals\u2019 discounts.\nDepartment stores had a grim 2018 with the summer collapse of House of Fraser kicking off a wave of desperate discounting. Debenhams is also facing serious problems and its share price collapsed by 90% last year. John Lewis said there had been up to 30% more promotions by rival retailers over the Christmas period than in 2017.\nThe potential break in the annual staff bonus comes after John Lewis slashed its bonus last year to just 5% of salary \u2013 the lowest level of payout since the 1950s. The bonus \u2013 which was first paid in 1920 and is handed to all staff, from shelf stackers to senior management \u2013 has not been suspended since the postwar economic downturn of 1953, when rationing was still in place.\nNew high street data has shown that total sales growth dropped to zero in December for the first time since 2008 as shops were hit by Brexit worries and a dramatic fall in consumer confidence. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) figures showed that all areas of the high street were hit by a fall in sales last month except food, where there was intense competition among the major supermarket chains.\nM&S blamed the weak economic environment for deterring shoppers, with both its food and clothing businesses suffering sales declines of more than 2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December.\nThe M&S chief executive, Steve Rowe, described its performance as steady in a difficult market: \u201cThe combination of reducing consumer confidence, mild weather, Black Friday and widespread discounting by our competitors made November a very challenging trading period.\u201d\nAgainst the tough backdrop Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer, emerged as one of winners with UK like-for-like sales up 2.2% over Christmas. It was the supermarket giant\u2019s best performance in nearly a decade with its chief executive, Dave Lewis, describing it as a \u201cvery strong Christmas performance which was ahead of the market\u201d.\nEarlier this week Aldi said it had a record Christmas as a growing number of Britons switch some of their grocery shopping away from the traditional supermarket chains. Lewis said there had been a \u201cflight to value\u201d at Tesco, with shoppers seeking out its no-frills ranges to save money, while its upmarket finest ranges had also done well.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the whole retail sector had a disappointing November, which set the tone for what can only be viewed as a poor Christmas,\u201d said Greg Lawless, a retail analyst at the City stockbroker Shore Capital.",

        "content": "The Japanese PM once got Theresa May\u2019s pulse racing but the magic\u2019s gone and she\u2019s too tired to care\nIt had come billed as one of the greatest love stories never told. In previous interviews, Theresa May had spoken of Shinz\u014d Abe, the Japanese prime minister, as her Rock. The one world leader who set her pulse racing. The man who truly got her. It was the relationship that transcended language barriers. Then again, May has always been more at home with silence.\nLove comes in many forms. Even near-indifference. After a day spent chatting to Abe about a new robotics deal \u2013 her software was seriously out of date \u2013 and visiting Twickenham, May looked as if she was all loved out. She managed a quick smile as she and Abe walked into the Downing Street side room for their joint press conference, but her eyes looked dead. The prime minister is currently running on little more than fumes. Almost as if the vote on Tuesday can\u2019t come soon enough. It\u2019s the waiting for inevitable defeat that\u2019s destroying her from the inside.\nMay got things rolling with a quick monotone roundup that was almost intelligible, as the voice of the simultaneous Japanese translator was about as loud as hers. She had very much enjoyed her day out, she mumbled in a manner that suggested the whole thing had been rather a chore.\nOn another day it might have been fun, but after the week she\u2019d had the last thing she needed was the enforced intimacy of a few hours not speaking to Abe. She kept her head down, staring at her script. They\u2019d talked a bit about how everything was going to be fine after Brexit, how the British economy was going to get a huge boost from the ending of the Japanese ban on British meat and how she was going to send out a Van Gogh on loan. And that was about it. She ended as arbitrarily as she had begun.\nAbe had looked on rather awkwardly while May spoke. He had been expecting something more engaged and appeared wrong-footed by the flatness of the British prime minister\u2019s delivery. He wasn\u2019t used to a woman who chose to define herself by her absence rather than her presence. Maybe not even Japan\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence could help.\nTo compensate, Abe became overanimated. There were no two countries closer than Britain and Japan. None. We were like brothers. And not even Brexit could divide us. May had negotiated the very best of the bad Brexit deals possible and he fervently hoped that it would be accepted because a no-deal Brexit was unimaginable. Not just to Japan but to the whole world.\nIt was just as well that May had by now tuned out and was almost catatonic, as this outright dismissal of one of her last remaining bargaining chips had not been part of the Downing Street playbook. Instead, she stood hunched and impassive, with only the occasional flash of anger betraying she was in fact still sentient. It was hard to know if the anger was directed at Abe or whether she was merely reliving some of the many indignities that had been heaped on her in the past few days.\nCome the questions from the media, May went back on to autopilot. She ignored Abe\u2019s appeal to take no-deal off the table and doubled down on her own doomed Brexit deal. It was her deal, it was the only deal, we wouldn\u2019t be joining the customs union, there was no plan B and she was going to get it through parliament. Even though she definitely wasn\u2019t. You almost had to admire her resilience and refusal to accept the inevitable. She would outlive the last cockroach in a nuclear wasteland.\nAfter taking a quick sideswipe at John Bercow over his decision to allow the Dominic Grieve amendment the day before \u2013 the Speaker is only one of many for whom she has now reserved a special place in hell \u2013 May tried to wrap the whole thing up by cutting short a British journalist who was about to ask Abe another awkward question about a no-deal Brexit. She\u2019d had enough humiliation for another day.\nAbe looked surprised to be denied the chance to speak and gamely had a stab at giving his opinion on a British legal aid case that had nothing to do with Japan before May butted in. The show was over. The two prime ministers walked away in silence. Just as they had arrived. May\u2019s public hell was over. Now she was merely left to her private hell.",

\u201creiterated\u201d concerns about refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi at a meeting with Thai counterparts on Thursday, as pressure mounts to have him freed.\nMarise Payne, who has been calling for al-Araibi\u2019s release since he was detained in late November, was in Bangkok for bilateral meetings and raised the cases of two refugees held by Thailand.\n\u201cWe are, as I\u2019ve said, very concerned about his detention, very concerned about any potential for return of Mr Araibi to Bahrain,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI have reiterated those concerns to both ministers.\u201d\nAl-Araibi was detained by Thai officials on the basis of an erroneous Interpol red notice over a vandalism conviction handed down in absentia at a Bahrain trial.\n\u201cMr Al-Araibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian government in recognition of his status as a refugee,\u201d Payne had noted on Wednesday.\nIn anticipation of Payne\u2019s meeting, human rights organisations and advocates renewed pressure on the parties involved to free Al-Araibi.\nAt a press conference and protest in Sydney, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, and high-profile football identities urged Payne to put \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Thailand.\nElaine Pearson, the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, said there were key questions for the Thai government and its decisions on Al-Araibi\u2019s case, while separately agreeing to protect Saudi woman Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun.\nPearson said the Thai government had an \u201cappalling record when it comes to collaborating with authoritarian regimes to return their citizens\u201d, citing the deportations of Uighurs and another Bahraini dissident who was then imprisoned, beaten and tortured.\nThailand and Bahrain have close investment relationships, and the Bahrain foreign affairs minister was scheduled to visit Thailand soon, Pearson said.\n\u201cWe are certainly concerned about why the Thai government is prioritising the relationship with the kingdom of Bahrain over its relationship with Australia.\u201d\nPearson said Al-Araibi was recognised under international law as a refugee.\n\u201cIf Hakeem is sent back to Bahrain it means all refugees, wherever they are in the world, will live in fear about travelling to certain countries because of the risk they could be returned to the countries they fled persecution from.\u201d\nGraham Thom, refugee coordinator at Amnesty International Australia, said the spotlight was not just on Thailand, but on Asean, which Thailand was set to become chair of this year.\n\u201cWe need the global community to stand up and condemn the situation both from Thailand and Bahrain that [allowed] this to occur,\u201d said Thom.\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary situation, it would be an extraordinary breach of Thailand\u2019s human rights obligations [if he were returned],\u201d he said.\nThe world football body, Fifa, issued another press release on Thursday calling for \u201ca humane and speedy resolution of the case\u201d and his release.\n\u201cThis player, a Bahrain national, is currently being detained in prison in Thailand awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings to Bahrain, where he was previously convicted of a criminal offence, the validity of which he strongly contests,\u201d it said.\nIt followed revelations by Guardian Australia that Fifa and executives from Football Federation Australia had met with Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president and Bahraini royal, Sheikh Salman Al-Khalifa, for the first time to discuss Al-Araibi\u2019s case.\nThursday\u2019s protest group also called for world football bodies, including Fifa, to live up to their own human rights codes, and for the UNHCR to do more to help Al-Araibi as they had done for Qunun.\nThey called for Sheikh Salman to make a public statement in support of Al-Araibi.\nFormer Socceroo captain and football analyst Craig Foster said the silence of the AFC was completely unacceptable, particularly in the context of human rights policies enacted in recent years.\n\u201cSheikh Salman is obligated to support Hakeem, he is obligated to do everything in his power to advocate both privately and publicly, and to use the immense leverage that football has with the Bahrain government \u2013 his own government \u2013 and the Thai government,\u201d said Foster.\n\u201cThe silence of the Asian Football Confederation is not just confounding, it\u2019s absolutely disgraceful under our human rights obligations within the entire football community.\u201d\nFatima Yazbek, a spokeswoman for the Gulf Institute of Democracy and Human Rights, said there was personal conflict between Al-Araibi and Sheikh Salman, and Sheikh Salman was not fulfilling his obligations to protect the player.\n\u201cHe should do something, otherwise step down from your position and leave someone more qualified to fulfil the obligations of the position.\u201d",

The Arsenal manager, who does not have a problem with Aaron Ramsey agreeing to join Juventus on a free transfer at the end of the season, has been linked with moves for Barcelona\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez and Sevilla\u2019s \u00c9ver Banega.\nHe expressed admiration for Banega in particular before admitting it is unlikely he will be given funds for permanent signings in January.\n\u201cWe cannot sign permanently,\u201d Emery said. \u201cWe can only loan players. I know the club is working on possibilities of which players can help us with big performances like we need now. I cannot say more.\u201d\nEmery worked with Banega and Su\u00e1rez at Sevilla. Su\u00e1rez, who joined Barcelona from Manchester City in 2013, is out of favour and he would help to solve Arsenal\u2019s lack of attacking width. It remains to be seen whether the club can secure a loan for the 25-year-old. It is thought Barcelona want \u00a310m for Su\u00e1rez.\nSevilla are likely to place a hefty price on Banega, who has been a key figure for Emery in the past. \u201cI know this player and he\u2019s a very good player,\u201d the former Sevilla manager said.\nEmery insisted he was not unhappy with Arsenal\u2019s financial restrictions: \u201cWe are working with the players who are with us now. Also we are giving chances to the young players and finding with them the regularity to be consistent when we need them to be.\n\u201cI am very happy. I know it is not easy for us now in this transfer market and if we can find one player who can help us like we need, with the quality and a different player for getting in our squad, we are going to do it. But I am happy with every player today. It is really some injuries that didn\u2019t help us in the last matches because we struggled with different injuries with the players.\n\u201cI am happy because another player can have chances when one player is injured and they are doing well, that is the reason for us being calm and my confidence with the club is big, they are working and if one or two players can come and help us that is perfect.\u201d\nEmery respects Ramsey\u2019s decision to join Juventus on a five-year deal worth \u00a336m. The player\u2019s future has been up in the air since Arsenal withdrew their contract offer this season. Emery\u2019s only demand is that the 27-year-old continues to show commitment.\n\u201cI respect his decision a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI say to him every day we need his performance for us. In the last match I was very happy with him. I asked in the last match at Blackpool if he is OK to help us play and he said: \u2018Yes, I want to play\u2019 and he played with a very big behaviour and commitment to us.\n\u201cAfter, his future belongs to him, his family and agent. Every day he\u2019s here with us, he\u2019s working very well. I want his behaviour and his focus to be on West Ham on Saturday.\n\u201cI cannot say more about his situation. The most important thing is that Aaron Ramsey is with us. His future I respect a lot because he has a very private decision but I repeat I am very happy with him.\u201d\nArsenal\u2019s defensive problems have eased for their trip to West Ham, with H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Shkodran Mustafi and Nacho Monreal returning to full training. Mesut \u00d6zil could also play after shaking off the knee injury that has kept him out since Boxing Day.",

In the plea, Cohen said: \u201cI made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.\u201d\nIndividual 1 was a reference to Trump. Cohen also pleaded guilty in August 2018 to several counts of fraud and campaign finance violations.\nWhen asked about Cohen\u2019s testimony on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d Trump has previously attacked Cohen as \u201ca rat\u201d and \u201ca liar\u201d on Twitter.",

        "content": "The new Stoke manager has pledged to deliver \u2018fast, attractive football\u2019 after his surprise arrival from third-tier Luton Town\nIt was a legitimate question and one Stoke\u2019s board must have considered before contacting Luton, yet the way Nathan Jones responded to the idea some people may be concerned about his lack of managerial experience at a higher level, including the players he has inherited who have spent the majority of their careers in the Premier League, said everything about the Welshman\u2019s self-belief.\n\u201cLook, there is, I wouldn\u2019t say a concern, but an eye on that, in terms of how you would deal with the more experienced players. But players will respond to the work that you do,\u201d says Jones, who was appointed as Gary Rowett\u2019s successor on Wednesday. \u201cSo I might have come from League One, I might now be a Championship manager, but I believe my work is top-end. If it\u2019s top-end, then players will respond to it. That\u2019s the only way I would like to gain their respect.\n\u201cI will get to know them, I will man-manage them, because that\u2019s part and parcel of my job, and it\u2019s what I like doing. But the fundamental thing is when we go out on the training ground, they will see work that defies where I\u2019ve come from. People will say: \u2018You haven\u2019t managed at the top level.\u2019 But I believe if I was to put my work against top-level coaches, there would be no big gap.\nAged 45, raised in a Welsh mining community, fluent in Spanish and a born-again Christian, Jones is a fascinating character. He spent the majority of his playing career in the lower leagues and, by his own admission, is a far better coach than he ever was a footballer. \u201cI would always see the next pass but I was never good enough to play it,\u201d says Jones, who had spells with Southend, Yeovil and Brighton as well as a stint in Spain.\nWhile Jones knew and accepted his limitations as a player, there is no ceiling on what he thinks he can achieve in the dugout. Ambitious and driven, there is an intensity that shines through in how he expects his teams to play \u2013 \u201ca fast, attractive style of football based around hard work\u201d \u2013 and in the way he talks.\nAsked what message he had for Stoke\u2019s supporters, Jones replied: \u201cI ask them to buy into it now. Be part of the journey now. Don\u2019t be a sceptic. Get right behind us, because they are a great group of fans. I\u2019ve played here, I\u2019ve had some hidings here. I\u2019ve listened to Delilah four times in a game. I can promise you that my staff will give them a team that they can be proud of. I guarantee it.\u201d\nJones never disappointed anyone at Luton in that respect. A club that was languishing in the bottom half of League Two when he was appointed, are second in League One three years later. Where some fans do feel let down, however, is in the manager\u2019s decision to leave, especially at a time when the club is on course to win consecutive promotions.\nJones admitted it was an extremely difficult decision. \u201cIt\u2019s like a marriage, it\u2019s difficult when you break up, sometimes there can be bitterness. But I gave Luton everything. I gave them my life. I loved the club. I had opportunities to move and I never even considered it. I think I significantly improved the whole football club. I united a club.\n\u201cNow, I understand there is going to be a certain heartache. The amount of time I\u2019ve cried from text messages that I\u2019ve had from players \u2026 when I think about it, it makes me emotional because I had a good time there. I was married to the club. I am ambitious but I had no intention to leave and to leave them in the lurch in any way. And I think I\u2019ve left them in a wonderful position. I hope they understand that I\u2019ve left purely for nothing other than total progression.\u201d\nThere has not been much sign of progression at Stoke of late. Relegated from the Premier League last season, Stoke invested heavily in the summer with a view to returning to the top flight at the first attempt, but find themselves in 14th place. With the league so tight, there is arguably still the opportunity to win promotion this season. \u201cThe gap isn\u2019t sizeable,\u201d Jones adds. \u201cIt\u2019s eight points to the play-offs.\u201d\nWhether that happens or not, Jones\u2019s faith in the way he goes about his work, and his life in general, will be unwavering. \u201cI believe we are on a journey, I\u2019m on a journey, I believe it\u2019s all God\u2019s will, so I trust that journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI work hard to be the best I can be and if I can respond a little bit to God\u2019s guidance, then it\u2019s a good place.\u201d",

        "content": "Education Policy Institute urges councils to redistribute surpluses to struggling schools\nState school budgets in England have deteriorated in the last year, according to analysis by a thinktank that says councils could redistribute surpluses to bail out struggling schools in the same region.\nThe Education Policy Institute looked at the accounts submitted by maintained and academy schools for 2017-18 and found that secondary schools were particularly hard hit.\nAccording to the EPI, half of all secondary academies and 60% of maintained secondary schools \u2013 those managed by local authorities \u2013 are spending more than they are receiving, forcing them to dip into their reserves.\nJules White, head of a secondary school in West Sussex and a founder of the WorthLess? campaign for fairer funding, said: \u201cTime and time again, independent analysts are confirming what every headteacher in the country knows; schools are sliding further and further into debt, regardless of whether they are local authority or academy controlled.\n\u201cNo doubt the Department for Education will bury its head in the sand again and trot out all of the usual smokescreens regarding efficiencies and surpluses, yet on the ground headteachers continue to cut staffing, their curricular offer and crucial pastoral services in order to make ends meet.\u201d\nIn a worrying sign, the EPI also said the proportion of local authority special schools in deficit has doubled from 5% to 10% since 2014.\n\u201cThese findings are further evidence of the funding pressures schools and councils are under, including support for children with special needs,\u201d said Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board.\nBut while schools budgets had worsened in the space of a year, the EPI said that many still had strong bank balances, and that overall the value of surpluses exceeded that of the combined deficits.\nIn 2017-18, local authority school deficits totalled \u00a3233m, while the total of surplus balances was \u00a31.8bn, of which \u00a3580m met the DfE\u2019s \u201cexcessive balance\u201d definition.\n\u201cIn fact, by the Department for Education\u2019s definition, nearly a quarter of a billion pounds is in accounts deemed excessive and uncommitted to any specific expenditure. The challenge for government, local authorities and school leaders is whether that money should now be redistributed,\u201d said Jon Andrews, the report\u2019s author and deputy head of research at the EPI.\n\u201cIn practice, over half of the \u2018excessive\u2019 balances are already committed by the schools to specific projects, and given the priority which the government attaches to school autonomy, there would likely be serious policy challenges involved in trying to reallocate such surpluses,\u201d the EPI said.\nThe EPI\u2019s suggestion drew a tepid response from school leaders, with Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of Schools and College Leaders, arguing that it was \u201cprudent financial management\u201d for schools to have surpluses.\n\u201cWhat is clear is that the current trend is one of increasing deficits and unless action is taken to improve the level of funding it is highly likely that educational standards will deteriorate,\u201d said Barton.\nA DfE spokesperson said that more than 90% of academies and maintained schools had broken even or were in surplus last year.\n\u201cWhilst the core schools and high needs budget is rising from almost \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to \u00a343.5bn by 2019-20, we do recognise the budgeting challenges schools face.\n\u201cThat is why the education secretary has set out his determination to work with the sector to help schools reduce the \u00a310bn they spend on non-staffing costs and ensure every pound is spent as effectively as possible to give children a great education,\u201d the DfE said.\nAngela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the government was refusing to accept that it had caused the funding crisis.\n\u201cThese cuts have made it impossible for many schools to even make ends meet, and there will be a generation of children paying the price for the Conservatives\u2019 failure,\u201d Rayner said.",

        "content": "Liverpool have a defensive dilemma, Spurs could struggle in midfield against Paul Pogba and United, while Rafael Ben\u00edtez is unlikely to go on the attack at Stamford Bridge\nMousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s impending move to Beijing Guoan is a reminder of Tottenham\u2019s lack of depth in important areas. The Belgian midfielder was once a mandatory pick for Mauricio Pochettino but injuries have caught up with him and he has featured in only 10 league games this season. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s decline has been a blow for Pochettino and Tottenham\u2019s manager has also had to deal with injuries to Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama, forcing him to ask a lot from Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko in the past month. Sissoko and Winks have responded by forming an effective partnership in central midfield, enabling Tottenham to force their way into the title race, but they looked tired against Chelsea on Tuesday. Manchester United, who visit Wembley on Sunday, will spy a weakness to exploit given that Pochettino\u2019s only alternative in recent weeks has been the inexperienced Oliver Skipp. Paul Pogba is probably licking his lips at the thought of stamping his authority all over midfield \u2013 assuming, of course, the United showman\u2019s resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is the real deal. JS\nIf you want an idea as to why some Leicester fans are frustrated with their team and Claude Puel, then observe their infuriating inconsistency of late. Their past six games in all competitions have been: defeat on penalties to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup after making a number of changes to the team; victory at Chelsea; victory in the league over Manchester City; defeat at home to Cardiff; victory at Everton; defeat to Newport in the FA Cup. Puel\u2019s decision to make wholesale changes against Newport was more defensible than against City, with their opponents 13th in League Two. But now they are out of both cups and have only that big seventh place to fight for as Puel prepares to take on his former club Southampton on Saturday. That is where they are at the moment but they may not stay there if they continue to be so erratic. NM\nUnai Emery has an intriguing call to make when Arsenal visit West Ham on Saturday. Mesut \u00d6zil is back in training after shaking off the knee injury that has kept him out since Boxing Day, and in previous seasons the German would have expected to walk straight back into the starting lineup. Not in the post-Wenger era, though. \u00d6zil\u2019s importance has dwindled, even though he still has the ability to unlock any defence with an eye-of-the-needle pass. The thinking is the team\u2019s defensive structure is not strong enough to carry brittle individuals and, although Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u2019s foot injury means a creative spot needs filling, Arsenal also have to think about containing Marko Arnautovic and Felipe Anderson in West Ham\u2019s attack. With that in mind, it could be a day for Alex Iwobi or Aaron Ramsey to provide extra thrust in midfield. Iwobi is in good form and Ramsey has knuckled down despite his impending move to Juventus; both will have cause to feel aggrieved if they lose out to \u00d6zil. JS\nThe dismissal of Gary Rowett by Stoke this week called to mind another manager who is talking a good game but not getting the results to back up his words. Marco Silva is different to Rowett in that he does have trophies to his name, most prominently the Greek title with Olympiakos, but even that is worth putting in context: Olympiakos have been champions 10 times since the Superleague was formed in 2006, so he was not exactly dragging a team to success with his managerial brilliance. Troy Deeney recently rated Silva as the best coach he has worked with but that will not be much use with the words of the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, hanging in the air. \u201cI look at the table and it is just not good enough,\u201d said Moshiri, and while he also said the club will \u201cstick with\u201d Silva, things can change extremely quickly. Everton host Bournemouth on Sunday. NM\nHaving seen how Chelsea were frustrated by Southampton\u2019s organisation in their previous league game, it is unlikely that Newcastle will be adventurous when they visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Rafael Ben\u00edtez often uses a spoiling approach against the big sides and the Spaniard will surely tell his players to sit deep, absorb pressure and try to take advantage of Maurizio Sarri\u2019s issues in attack. Chelsea drew another blank in their midweek defeat by Tottenham, despite dominating territory and possession, and it will not be in Newcastle\u2019s interests to play an open game. Another game of patience will test Sarriball\u2019s foundations. JS\nLiverpool could head to Brighton on Saturday with Virgil van Dijk as their only fit recognised central defender. With Joe Gomez and Jo\u00ebl Matip sidelined and Dejan Lovren not expected to recover from a thigh injury in time, J\u00fcrgen Klopp will likely turn to Fabinho. Chris Hughton\u2019s side are unbeaten in four games and have proved a tough nut to crack at home \u2013 only Tottenham and Chelsea have beaten them there in the league this season. But the assured performance of the 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever in Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup defeat at Molineux on Monday will have given Klopp food for thought, especially when watching him wriggle away from H\u00e9lder Costa and R\u00faben Neves before freeing Mohamed Salah on the counterattack. Klopp must choose whether to throw the Dutch teenager in at the deep end once more, or opt for a more experienced head. BF\nHuddersfield\u2019s defeat by Bristol City in the FA Cup was the equivalent of a boxer\u2019s shorts falling down after being beaten up for eight rounds, one last indignity after the previous pummelling. They have lost nine matches in a row, eight of those in the league, and while they have got some way to go before reaching the Premier League record (Sunderland\u2019s 2002-03 run of 15 consecutive losses), they have definitely reached the stage where they are looking for any help they can get. In the run-up to Saturday\u2019s away game at Cardiff, David Wagner said he has no idea whether they will be able to address their biggest problem by signing a striker, so they may have to look to another source for goals. Jason Puncheon has not scored this season but, at the very least, his arrival from Crystal Palace will add a little more dynamism to their attack. At this point, anything is worth a try. NM\nIt has been a tough journey to fitness for Tom Cleverley. An achilles problem kept him out of the Watford team for the best part of a year, but after a few substitute appearances he made his first start against Woking in the FA Cup last weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long hard year and a long road back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for me.\u201d In some respects, Cleverley\u2019s return could not be better timed, given the continuing uncertainty over Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, who this week offered the world\u2019s politest \u201ccome and get me\u201d plea to PSG. Central midfield is not an area of massive weakness for Watford, who visit Crystal Palace on Saturday, but if Doucour\u00e9 does depart then Cleverley being an option again will at least mean they will not have to rush to find a replacement. NM\nPep Guardiola\u2019s side have hammered in 16 goals in two matches and, regardless of opposition, those numbers are frightening. Wolves have an impressive record against the top six, appearing to raise their game when the big boys come to Molineux, having beaten Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham. But when Manchester City \u2013 who host them on Monday \u2013 are in the mood, especially at the Etihad, they are a different beast. Wolves should arrive with confidence and not total trepidation after upsetting Liverpool in the FA Cup but Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side must again bring their A-game. Wolves, so comfortable without the ball, are solid but flexible in defence \u2013 they have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal \u2013 and given that City will want to dominate possession, they will have to show patience. BF\nIs it a coincidence that Burnley\u2019s results have improved since Dwight McNeil broke into their first team? Maybe but the young winger has certainly added more of a spark to Sean Dyche\u2019s side, who have won all three games he has started, two in the league and against Barnsley in the FA Cup. They host second-bottom Fulham on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we put him in for the sake of it, it\u2019s because we think he can deliver performances, which he has done,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cI think we\u2019ve timed our run well with that. It\u2019s not just dropping somebody in, taking them out and you never see them again, it\u2019s been building up slowly but surely.\u201d As well as McNeil\u2019s introduction, Tom Heaton has returned in goal, and praise must go to Dyche: neither decision was hasty but both are paying off nicely so far.

Its temporary nature can render the city mutable, changing the way we approach an everyday city space, or changing the space for a short, golden summer window. That\u2019s why I\u2019m eager for Counting and Cracking, Belvoir\u2019s ambitious production that is building a Sri Lankan town hall into our own landmark Town Hall building. A city\u2019s heart transplanted into the heart of Sydney.\nPlus the play is set to be sprawling, new and epic. Written by S. Shakthidharan and directed by Belvoir\u2019s artistic director, Eamon Flack, 16 actors will play four generations of a family that has come from Sri Lanka\u2019s Colombo to suburban Sydney, although whether they can ever leave their past behind is another matter entirely.\nTogether we will reckon with what refuge and reconciliation \u2013 both personal and political \u2013 really means, how families change and yet remain familiar. And what better place to do that than in a well-known building that has been transformed?\n Counting and Cracking runs at Sydney Town Hall until 2 February; it is also part of the 2019 Adelaide festival in March\nRecommended by: Brigid Delaney\nThis one-man show contains multitudes. Under the skilful direction of Anthea Williams, author, MC and poet Omar Musa returns to the Griffin theatre for a one-hour meditation on masculinity, love, religion, race and family.\nTaking Muhammad Ali\u2019s death as an organising principle, Musa charts how his life fell apart after the boxer\u2019s death. Using poetry, song and prose, he evokes a boyhood in Queanbeyan with a strict, religious father, racist taunts at school, and wild teenage years, before bringing us up to speed: he\u2019s deep in love, and he\u2019s riding fast in cars with his best mate, Danny. But then his hero dies.\nThe material is personal, but it\u2019s when Musa is talking about race in Australia and the culture wars that he\u2019s at his most powerful. But there\u2019s is humour in the darkness too.\n Since Ali Died runs at SBW Stables theatre, Darlinghurst, until 19 January, and at Riverside Theatres, Parramatta, from January 22-25\nRecommended by: Steph Harmon\nWhen Simon McBurney first read Stefan Zweig\u2019s 1939 novel Beware of Pity, he says it disturbed something in him. \u201c[I was] unable to put it down, not even sure I liked it,\u201d he wrote in the Guardian. \u201cI found myself gripped and troubled.\u201d\nIt feels fitting that he would then collaborate on an adaptation with German theatre company Schaub\u00fchne; I had a similar reaction to Schaub\u00fchne\u2019s hyper-masculine, bombastic take on Richard III when it came to Adelaide festival in 2017. It was puerile and vicious and underserved the women even more than the original text does \u2013 but it grabbed and rattled me, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling for a week.\nSchaub\u00fchne is known globally for its twisted take on classic texts, but this is the first time it has collaborated with the British theatre-maker and auteur McBurney, whose company Complicite \u2013 according to this publication \u2013 irrevocably changed the face of British theatre.\nSet in Europe on the brink of war, the story is of a man whose pity-driven social gaffe \u2013 and subsequent poor choices \u2013 sets a terrible train of events in motion from which he cannot escape.\n\u201cWith dazzling virtuosity, McBurney and his team evoke a vanished world,\u201d wrote Michael Billington of this \u201castonishing\u201d production when it ran at the Barbican in February 2017. McBurney\u2019s last show to tour Australia was his \u201caural masterpiece\u201d, the Encounter, which used 3D audio to transport audiences deep into the Amazon rainforest. I\u2019m eager to see what this collaboration brings.\n Beware of Pity runs at the Roslyn Packer Theatre, Walsh Bay, from 23-27 January\nRecommended by: Kate Hennessy\nI love a good gallery mash-up of sound, art and ideas. This three-night series is set amid the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s Masters of Modern Art from the Hermitage, which is being marketed as a \u201cblockbuster exhibition\u201d with works by Kandinsky, Picasso and Matisse.\nYet it will not be \u201cblockbuster\u201d artists performing because that\u2019s not how these things roll. Instead we\u2019ll have cultish iconoclasts such as the pianist Chris Abrahams (The Necks), the ambient maestro William Basinski (The Disintegration Loops), Lawrence English (Room40), Dean Hurley (Twin Peaks: The Return) and the Italian minimalist Caterina Barbieri.\nWill English ask us to lie down to sponge up the sound? Everyone was nude at the last gallery dance show I saw, so what transgressions might Force Majeure\u2019s Danielle Micich be plotting? Australian sound artists and musicians Del Lumanta, Corin Ileto, Becky Sui Zhen (No Zu) and Casey Hartnett are presenting newly commissioned work, a netherworld that festival ticket-holders often neglect to properly explore although it often yields the most gold with artists still striving and pushing outwards. How will these women respond to iconic works from dead male artists?\n Masters of Modern Sound takes place at the Art Gallery of NSW from 10-12 January\nRecommended by: Emily Nicol\nAfter premiering last year at Brisbane festival, the beloved Aboriginal actor and playwright Ursula Yovich\u2019s Man with the Iron Neck has been praised as a moving, poetic and visually stunning work of physical theatre which addresses the youth suicide crisis faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.\nDirectors Josh Bond and Gavin Robens mix aerial theatre with video design to explore universal themes of loss, trauma and survival through the experience of three Aboriginal teens in small-town Australia.\nWe enter the search for meaning and hope with Ash, who \u2013 after losing his best friend, Bear, to suicide \u2013 becomes obsessed with 1930s death-defying stuntman The Great Peters who in his act jumped from bridges with a rope around his neck.\nWith an ultimately hopeful narrative, it\u2019s a timely and potent offering which will hopefully open up more discussion about a subject that should be on the national agenda.\n Man with the Iron Neck runs at the Sydney Opera House from 23-26 January; it is also part of the 2019 Adelaide festival in March\nRecommended by: Alexandra Spring\nAt last count I figured I\u2019ve lived in about 25 homes during my life. Only one was newly built, one was freshly renovated, and the rest were existing homes that I tried to put my stamp on. Mostly I didn\u2019t spend too much time wondering about those who\u2019d walked on those floors before me, who\u2019d stared up at the same ceilings during sleepless nights or washed themselves in those showers. But maybe I should have.\nThese are some of the questions that the US theatre-maker Geoff Sobelle \u2013 last in Australia for 2016\u2019s The Object Lesson \u2013 explores in his acclaimed show Home. The theatre/music/dance/magic show asks \u201cWhere is home? If it is not a place, what is home?\u201d On stage a house is constructed in real time, then all the residents move in to live out their lives, often on top of each other and all at the same time. It\u2019s a commentary on overcrowded living, gentrification, migration and our ever-disposable society.\nAnd yet according to the critics, these important questions are handled in a light and deft way. The Boston Globe critic Don Aucoin writes, \u201cIndeed, the show turns into an all-out party at the end \u2026 to which the audience is invited.\u201d That sounds like a show I want to see.\n Home runs at the Roslyn Packer Theatre, Walsh Bay, until 18 January\nRecommended by: Van Badham\nLocal cabaret favourites like La Clique and Velvet have whetted a popular appetite for high-end variety shows. What renders them exquisite is not merely the uniqueness of their acts, be they acrobats, magicians, dancers or songbirds. It\u2019s their immersive theatrical aesthetics that honour the imagined glories of the past: the burlesque bars, circuses, travelling carnivals, speakeasies, music halls and other smoke-and-mirrors spaces in whose shadows common humanity could experience the exotic and thrillingly taboo.\nIn this tradition, Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Mimi promises to \u201cpart the curtains on an enchanted world\u201d. Billing itself as a \u201csumptuous cabaret of delights\u201d, its aesthetic homage is to 1930s Shanghai, \u201ca city famous for its flamboyant clubs and heady nights\u201d.\nThe Australian company Finucane and Smith is an international master of the genre, and the involvement of the brilliant Moira Finucane is reason enough to see a show. She directs this production, which engages \u2013 through cabaret \u2013 the cultural conversation between east and west, and features an international lineup of acts including the Qinghai Acrobatic Troupe and a live band playing \u201clong-lost vintage Chinese jazz and blues unearthed in a condemned Mumbai warehouse\u201d.\nAlso, guests are invited to \u201cdress to the nines and immerse yourself\u201d. Who wouldn\u2019t want to go to this? You\u2019ll see me in my diamant\u00e9s.\n Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Mimi runs at the Riverside Theatre, Parramatta, from 10-20 January\nRecommended by: Steve Dow\nJoel Bray, a fair-skinned, queer, Wiradjuri dancer, stands in a dressing gown on a bed in a Sydney hotel room performing a preview of his show Biladurang. He tells his boutique audience of about 20, who have also changed into robes, about entering a newsagent at age 15 wearing his school uniform and selecting a magazine with a hot dude on the cover. \u201cMy cock jumped,\u201d he grins, then carefully enunciates each word: \u201cA real \u2026 gay \u2026 porno.\u201d\nComing of age in rural Orange, New South Wales, in a white Pentecostal household, and spending summers with his Indigenous father, a land rights activist, Bray embraced his difference. This show\u2019s title, which means platypus, is apposite, as Sydney festival\u2019s director, Wesley Enoch, explains, being a monotreme and a duck-billed, amphibious mammal. \u201cWho knows what a platypus is? This notion of a mix of everything, and what\u2019s your identity in this world?\u201d\nMoreover, what I\u2019m looking forward to in Bray\u2019s coming show, already seen at Melbourne Fringe and Brisbane festival and soon at the Dance Massive festival in Melbourne, is the sense of shared humanity. Bray waits in the foyer afterward: \u201cI\u2019ve had people hug me, I\u2019ve had people crying, I\u2019ve had people share their stories of discovering their Aboriginality late in life.\u201d\n Biladurang runs at the QT Hotel from 11-20 January\nRecommended by: Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore\nThe South African-born and London-based Nakhane is perhaps most well-known for his starring role in the 2017 movie The Wound. The film took a long hard look at the hyper-masculine Xhosa circumcision ritual, ulwaluko and, controversially, featured three main gay characters (its homosexual scenes prompted protests across South Africa).\nHe is also a musician whose songs \u2013 mixing electronics, vocals, folk and acoustic guitar \u2013 often draw on the heritage of his Christian roots. Openly gay since his 20s, Nakhane\u2019s latest album, You Will Not Die, documents the collision between his sexuality and the religion he has now rejected. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Hutchison pegged him as One to Watch last year, comparing his sound with the \u201cemphatic pop\u201d of Perfume Genius and describing the record as \u201cfearless \u2026 delivered with heart-stopping fragility\u201d. He is also a stellar performer. Do not miss this concert.\n Nakhane plays at the Spiegeltent in Hyde Park on 18 January, before playing at Mona Foma, in Launceston, at the Tivoli, in Brisbane and at Melbourne Museum during Midsumma",

        "content": "Murray unsure he will make it to Wimbledon\n \u2018The pain is too much. I don\u2019t want to continue\u2019\n In pictures: the highs and lows of Murray\u2019s career\nAndy Murray\u2019s career is all but over. He expects his match against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday to be his last but, even if another hip operation were to help him reach a more emotional and perhaps more fitting farewell at Wimbledon, it will never be the same for the player who stood alongside Fred Perry as the greatest Britain has ever had. Many would say Murray was the greater, but it is a fine call.\nThe former world No1 and three-time slam champion conceded that the pain that has been running through his right hip with increasing strength the past few months has brought his serious playing days to a reluctant conclusion.\nMurray turns 32 on 15 May, when he would normally be preparing for another assault on the French Open \u2013 which is where the chronic weakness in his hip became almost unbearable in 2017 against Stan Wawrinka \u2013 but the chances of his returning there are virtually nil, as he admitted in a press conference in which he had to leave the room to compose himself, as the emotion welled in his reddening eyes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance of that, for sure,\u201d he said when asked if this tournament \u2013 in which he has lost in five finals \u2013 would be his sign-off from the game he has played since he was 10 in Dunblane.\n\u201cI am not sure I am able to play through the pain for another four or five months,\u201d he said of his original plan to bow out at the All England Club, where he won two of his three majors.\nIt was a year ago in Melbourne that Murray reluctantly agreed with his long-time medical confidant, John O\u2019Donnell, a leading hip specialist, that he needed an operation to continue playing. It did not quite work, but he gave it as good a shot as he could muster, playing 12 matches, winning five, but only two against top 20 opponents. It became increasingly obvious that his ability to compete at the highest level was waning.\nThe moment it fully dawned on him arrived in December during his preparation for Melbourne. The pain was now insistent and deep. There was no relief, even in everyday activities.\nMurray now has to confront more surgery to repair the damage of nearly a dozen years at the top of the game.\n2006: Wins  first ATP Tour title\nMurray begins the year splitting from his coach Mark Petchey and replacing Tim Henman as British No 1 and goes on to claim more early-career landmarks: he beats Roger Federer for the first time, in Ohio, and wins his first ATP Tour event in San Jose, California, in front of Kim Sears, later Mrs Murray.\n2012: Olympic gold and first slam\nMurray produces a straight-sets demolition of Roger Federer in the Olympic final at Wimbledon. He then goes on to win his first major, beating Novak Djokovic in New York in a five-set epic, finishing close to midnight, becoming the first British man since Fred Perry in the 1930s to win a singles slam title.\n2013: Ends wait for British men\u2019s singles champion at Wimbledon \nMurray had raised hopes of emulating Perry at Wimbledon when he reached the final in 2012, only to come up against Roger Federer and a closed roof, which benefited the Swiss. A year later, however, on a boiling hot day at SW19, he faced down Novak Djokovic for the second time in three slam finals and won again, in straight sets, although he said he could hardly serve in the final game. He ended the 77-year wait for a British men\u2019s singles champion, against the man considered the \nbest in the world at the time.\n2016: Grand slam No 3\nThe defence of his Wimbledon title in 2014 had not gone as planned, but two years later he showed he was back to his best. Against Milos Raonic in the final in SW19, he nullified the Canadian\u2019s huge serve and cantered to victory in straight sets, leaving him one shy of Perry\u2019s total of three Wimbledon wins.\n2016: A slice of Olympic history\nMurray had won gold in the 2012 Games on familiar turf but Rio de Janeiro presented different challenges, yet he overcame those to make Olympic history. He beat Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in five sets in the final and became the first man or woman to win consecutive singles tennis golds.\n$61.1m\nMurray\u2019s total career prize money from his singles and doubles successes combined\n45\nHis total career singles titles, with an overall\u00a0 match win-loss ratio of 663-190 (77.73%)\n\u201cI have an option to have another operation, which is a little bit more severe than what I have had before,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving my hip resurfaced will allow me to have a better quality of life, be out of pain. That is something I\u2019m seriously considering right now. Some athletes have had that and gone back to competing. But there are obviously no guarantees with that, and it is not something\u2026the reason for having an operation is not to return to professional sport, it\u2019s just for a better quality of life.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain for probably about 20 months now. I have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better. It hasn\u2019t helped loads. I\u2019m in a better place than I was six months ago, but still in a lot of pain. It has been tough.\n\u201cIn the middle to the end of December in my training block, I spoke to my team, and I told them, \u2018I cannot keep doing this.\u2019 I needed to have an end point because I was playing with no idea when the pain was going to stop. I felt like making that decision. I said to my team, \u2018Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon. That\u2019s where I would like to stop playing.\u2019 But I am not certain I am able to do that.\u201d\n\u201cTough\u201d has been Murray\u2019s watchword in a career that seemed eternally embroidered in struggle. Very little came easy. But he is steeling himself for what is \u201calmost certainly\u201d one last effort, against the Spaniard Bautista Agut, who has lost to him in their three previous meetings but is likely to win on Monday.\n\u201cYes, I am going to play,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cI can still play to a level, but not a level I am not happy playing at.\u201d Roger Federer remarked in London in November that Murray looked to be playing \u201ctop 30\u201d tennis, and might even improve on that. It is not a place Murray would be happy, though. Now he has to deal with Bautista Agut.\n2008: first grand slam final\nFew had expected Murray to beat Nadal in the semi-finals in New York but he did, raising hopes he could somehow produce the same result against Federer in the final. Despite some flashes of resistance, he lost to the dominant Swiss in straight sets.\n 2010-16: Australian Open\nFive times Murray reached the final of the year\u2019s first major and five times he lost: 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. No one has lost that many times in a slam final without ever winning it at some stage. The closest he came was defeat in four sets in 2013 and 2015, both to\u00a0 Djokovic.\n2013: back surgery\nA stellar year ended on something of a low note. He already had hip problems and he had withdrawn from the French Open in May so he finally took the decision to try and sort out the issues in time for the next season in order to defend his hard-won Wimbledon title.\n2016: French Open pain\nEleven years into his professional career he broke new ground at Roland Garros. For so long he had failed to produce performances that matched his world ranking but then he reached the final in Paris. His old nemesis, Djokovic, was there, lying in wait again.\n2019: calling it a day\nGiven his condition at Wimbledon in 2017, where he limped and lost to Sam Querrey in the quarters, it was clear something had to be done. Hip surgery wasn\u2019t a surprise in early 2018, but the location \u2013 Melbourne \u2013 was and slow recovery meant he only played the US Open.\nIn his last tournament, Bautista Agut beat Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic and Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych to lift the title in Doha. Monday\u2019s match could be an ugly spectacle, but Murray will give what he has left all the way to the end.\nMurray was aware of the whispers that he was finished.\n\u201cYou guys see me running around a tennis court, walking between points,\u201d he said of his now trademark limp. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look good and it doesn\u2019t look comfortable. There are little things, day to day, that are also a struggle. It would be nice to be able to do them without any pain \u2013 putting shoes on, socks on, things like that.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main reason for doing it. If I was to have an operation for that, I would rehab correctly, do it properly to give my hip the best chance at being good as it can be. But I am also realistic. I know it\u2019s not an easy thing to come back to or play professional sport to a high level. I mean it has been done; Bob Bryan had this operation post-Wimbledon last year and he is back playing. I have had lots of communications with him about it. But there is a difference between singles and doubles in terms of the physicality and the movement. Certainly no guarantees there.\u201d\nAnd, no, he would not contemplate a career in doubles. For now, and probably forever, it is over. He will be hugely missed \u2013 by fans, rivals and even the media he occasionally jousted with in one of the most entertaining and interesting careers in the history of British sport.",

        "content": "Your no-frills primer to the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union\nConfused by the latest developments in the UK\u2019s fraught departure from the European Union? Here\u2019s your no-frills primer to what\u2019s going on in Brexit \u2013 and what might happen next.\nTwo-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part divorce deal late last year.\nThe first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the \u201cbackstop\u201d) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\nThe second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.\nIn theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.\nBritain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal).\nEssentially because the withdrawal agreement \u2013 and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border \u2013 does not have a majority in parliament.\nMPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels \u201crule-taker\u201d, potentially trapped in the EU\u2019s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.\nThe opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.\nThat is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.\nGood question. The EU hasn\u2019t budged (it can\u2019t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.\nParliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals \u2013 in the form of amendments to the deal \u2013 with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.\nIn the meantime, the prime minister\u2019s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling \u2013 and winning \u2013 amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.\nThe problem is that while there is no clear majority for May\u2019s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour\u2019s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted \u201cNorway-plus\u201d, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.\nAssuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it \u2013 or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament \u2013 to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.\nBrexit, in other words, is far from over yet.",

Despite finding the allegation credible, Google allowed Rubin to resign with a $90m exit package, the Times reported.\nNews of the payout ignited unprecedented outrage among Google employees, thousands of whom staged a global walkout to demand change.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the board minutes show that the payout was approved by board members \u201csince they apparently feared that if they fired Rubin for cause, he would sue Google for wrongful termination and all the tawdry details of sexual harassment by senior executives at Google would become public\u201d.\nNumerous Google executives have reportedly dated or had affairs with subordinates.\n\u201cThe tone was, \u2018It\u2019s a free-for-all,\u2019\u201d said Ravel of the board minutes. \u201cPeople who are not at the top are going to receive retribution, and everyone else gets a free pass.\u201d\nThe minutes were obtained under state laws that allow shareholders to inspect certain corporate records. They are currently redacted, but Bottini suggested that he would ask a judge to unseal them.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t believe what\u2019s in these minutes,\u201d he said.\nAn attorney for Rubin said in a statement: \u201cThis lawsuit, like much of the recent media coverage, mischaracterizes Andy\u2019s departure from Google and sensationalizes claims made about Andy by his ex-wife. Andy left Google voluntarily. Andy denies any misconduct, and we look forward to telling his story in court.\u201d\nAmong the reforms sought in the lawsuit is the elimination of Alphabet\u2019s dual-class structure, which allows Page and Brin to maintain voting control over the company, despite the fact that they no longer own a majority of its stock.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said Ravel. \u201cWhat we have asked for are a lot of changes in corporate governance at Google, and that is really the ultimate purpose of this litigation.\u201d",

        "content": "International team say \u2018spectacular\u2019 data hints at historic breakthrough\nAstronomers attempting to capture the first images of the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way have given early hints that the ambitious project has been successful.\nThe observations, by the Event Horizon Telescope, are expected to be unveiled in the spring in one of the most eagerly awaited scientific announcements of 2019. Now, a senior scientist on the project has said \u201cspectacular\u201d data was gathered during observations of two black holes, including Sagittarius A* at the centre of our own galaxy.\n\u201cWe managed to get very high-quality data at the very high resolutions necessary to observe the [black hole\u2019s] shadow, if it\u2019s really there,\u201d said Sera Markoff, a professor of theoretical astrophysics and astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam, who co-leads the EHT\u2019s Multiwavelength Working Group.\nThe team is in the final phase of reviewing data that was gathered in 2017 and Markoff could not confirm yet whether the observations had produced the first direct image of a black hole\u2019s silhouette.\nProf Peter Galison, who is based at the department of the history of science at Harvard University and is also involved in the project, said that, if successful, the EHT\u2019s first image would become one of the most significant in the past 50 years of astronomy. \u201cIf we get an image out of it, it will become one of the iconic images of science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinarily ambitious project.\u201d\nBlack holes were first predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, which reimagined gravity as the warping of space and time by matter and energy.\u00a0\nThe equations predicted that, beyond a certain threshold, when too much matter or energy is concentrated in one place, space and time collapse, leaving behind a sinkhole through which light and matter can enter but not escape.\u00a0\nAt first these were thought to be mathematical oddities, rather than real astronomical objects, but in the past century overwhelming evidence has confirmed that black holes are out there.\nThe edge of the black hole is defined by its so-called event horizon. This is the point at which escaping would require something to travel at faster than the speed of light \u2013 which as far as we know nothing does \u2013 so it is the point of no return.\nBlack holes are surrounded by an accretion disk of dust and gas, orbiting at close to the speed of light. A lot of this material is destined for oblivion, although some of it is ejected as powerful jets of radiation.\nThere is little doubt about the existence of black holes: the phenomenally dense objects distort the fabric of space-time in their vicinity, causing objects and light to appear to swerve off course. More recently, the gravitational wave observatory Ligo has detected ripples sent out across space-time when pairs of black holes collide.\nUntil now, though, a black hole has never been directly observed. The main barrier is that black holes are so compact that a telescope roughly the size of Earth would be required to see even the nearest one.\nThe EHT gets around this by linking together 15-20 telescopes spanning the South Pole, Europe, South America, Africa, North America and Australia. Collectively, the array has a resolution equivalent to being able to see a drawing pin in New York from London.\nThe EHT uses a technique known as interferometry, in which astronomers at observatories on different continents simultaneously observe the same object, then combine the collected data on a supercomputer.\nThis requires all the telescopes in the array to swivel towards the target black hole and measure every radio wave coming from its direction. Coordinating this was a \u201chuge accomplishment of diplomacy and organisation\u201d, according to Galison.\nThe EHT has two primary targets: Sagittarius A*, at the centre of the Milky Way, and a supermassive black hole called M87 in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. M87 is about 50m-60m light years away, but at more than six billion solar masses (1,000 times larger than our local black hole), astronomers hope it should be visible.\nNo one is sure what the image will look like but theoretical predictions show a black silhouette, set against a surrounding glow of radiation, something like the depiction in the film Interstellar. \u201cYou\u2019d imagine seeing a black shadow or depression,\u201d said Markoff.\nBesides telling us what black holes look like, the EHT could also reveal whether they have properties predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity and give insights into exotic processes that occur in the extreme environment close to the event horizon.\nDetailed observations will also be made of dramatic jets of material that are thrown out from some black holes, including M87. It is not clear whether Sagittarius A*, a relatively small black hole, has jets \u2013 it is possible that they are too feeble to have been spotted previously \u2013 and the EHT could resolve this question.\n\u201cWe see these enormous jets of plasma moving almost at the speed of light,\u201d said Markoff. \u201cThey can be hundreds of millions of times the size of the black hole itself \u2013 bigger than the galaxy.\u201d\nBlack hole jets are believed to play a major role in cosmology, contributing to the formation of the cosmic web, in which galaxies are strung in clusters across the universe.",

        "content": "The actor, who died of an overdose aged 33, would have been 70 this month. His enduring appeal lies not in his addictions, but in his comic genius\n\u201cWhat you need to understand about John Belushi,\u201d the director Ivan Reitman tells me, \u201cis he really was this extraordinary talent. I\u2019ve known a lot of famous people but he was at the centre of the zeitgeist in a way that\u2019s hard to describe now. But his fame took over to a degree I\u2019d never seen before and haven\u2019t seen since.\u201d\nBelushi would have turned 70 this month, but instead he died aged 33 in 1982. Yet unlike other influential comedians of that era who died young \u2013 Doug Kenney, the founder of the comedy magazine National Lampoon; Belushi\u2019s Saturday Night Live (SNL) co-star Gilda Radner \u2013 his legend burns bright. His face can still be seen on a million T-shirts and even more posters on the walls of those born decades after he died. In 2015, Rolling Stone voted him the greatest of all of SNL\u2019s 145 cast members, beating Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey and Bill Murray. The magazine cited Belushi\u2019s comedy skills and physicality \u2013 \u201ca wrestler\u2019s body with a dancer\u2019s feet, something boyishly vulnerable in his madness\u201d \u2013 as the reasons for his lasting appeal, and this is all true. But it would be naive to pretend that Belushi\u2019s premature death doesn\u2019t play a part in his enduring reputation.\nEver since he was found dead in the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood, his heart stopped by an overdose of cocaine and heroin, Belushi has become synonymous with hedonism, appetite, excess \u2013 like his memorably greedy character Bluto in Animal House. His consumption of narcotics, especially cocaine, has become only more infamous since he died. This is thanks in no small part to Wired, the biography published shortly after his death, written by Bob Woodward, which laid out in deadening detail how much cocaine Belushi took and when.\nBelushi\u2019s loved ones loathed Wired, and remain wary of talking to outsiders about him, resentful of how he has been reduced to his addictions. Belushi\u2019s widow, Judy Belushi Pisano, puts it this way: \u201cSeveral articles \u2013 and a rather well circulated book \u2013 have covered the drug story. It would be refreshing to have a story that actually celebrated John\u2019s beautiful life: his courage to forge the life he dreamed in an unfamiliar landscape, his dedication to his craft, his epic friendships and loving temperament.\u201d\nBut the life of Belushi cannot be told without reference to his death. And as much as those close to him wish others would stop focusing on the drugs, almost all the people I speak to about him talk without prompting about the effect drugs had on the man they loved. But it is also true that while the drugs might have added to his legend, he wouldn\u2019t be a legendary comedian if he had just been an addict.\nBelushi was born and raised in suburban Chicago, the oldest son of Albanian immigrants. \u201cHis parents never assimilated and I think it was hard for John, going to this all-American high school in the day and coming home to this very Albanian family in the evening. None of us in the neighbourhood even knew what Albania was,\u201d says Pisano, who started dating Belushi while they were at school together. \u201cJohn looked different from all of us \u2013 dark, and there was a joke that he was born with a beard. So he was self-conscious of his ethnicity, and he never brought people back to his home \u2013 he always went to other people\u2019s houses. Maybe that\u2019s when he got in the habit of always hanging out with people.\u201d\nWhatever insecurities Belushi felt about his background, he was a star from the get-go. At school, he was a footballer, a drummer in a band, a talent-show champion and the homecoming king. After a brief foray into college, he tried out for Second City, the Chicago improvisational comedy enterprise that has since trained Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert and Amy Poehler. He was \u2013 and remains \u2013 the only actor to be hired directly into the main troupe, as opposed to having to train with the touring company first. Belushi, by now something of a shaggy haired, dope-smoking hippy, could do extreme gross-out jokes, but also subtle physical comedy, and he stole every sketch he was in.\n\u201cThe first night I saw him improvising on stage, I thought, \u2018God, I will never take chances like that. I don\u2019t have that kind of courage.\u2019 But there was always something safer and more comfortable about being me than there was about being him,\u201d Belushi\u2019s fellow Second City performer, Harold Ramis, later recalled.\nBelushi was then hired by the National Lampoon to do its stage and radio shows, along with Christopher Guest, Chevy Chase, Radner, Bill Murray and Ramis. This was arguably the greatest generation of young American comedic talent, and Belushi was at the very centre of it. Reitman produced the off-Broadway production, the National Lampoon Show. \u201cI tried to direct them, but they all laughed that off \u2013 they directed themselves. But while they didn\u2019t listen to me, they all listened to John. He was the most remarkable performer in this remarkable group. He would just walk on stage with this Brando-like charisma,\u201d says Reitman.\nPeople who knew Belushi in the early years describe a warm and deeply loyal man, one who always tried to get jobs for his friends and was so gentle that if his cat fell asleep on his lap he would be late for rehearsals rather than wake up his pet. On the other hand, he could be \u201cintimidating, because he was such a force of personality. That was how you had to be to stand out and be funny in that group,\u201d says Reitman. It was at this point that Belushi was hired to be in the first season of SNL. \u201cJohn was wary of TV at first, but he knew the most essential thing: how to hold the audience in his hand. He never left the stage without connecting with the audience. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me that he took off like he did,\u201d says Lorne Michaels, SNL\u2019s creator and producer.\nAs much as the show made Belushi\u2019s name, it was, Pisano tells me, \u201calso something of a battle for him\u201d. Belushi had struggled with Chase and Guest at National Lampoon: \u201cThey had a private school, put-down kind of humour, and John was an easy mark. He was from the midwest, he was overweight, he hadn\u2019t graduated from college, he was ethnic \u2013 no, even better, he was Albanian. This was all good fodder,\u201d she writes in Belushi, her 2005 biography of her late husband. This dynamic repeated itself on SNL, as Chase was also hired in the first season: \u201cChevy has a very quick wit and his humour could be cruel. I think they were mutually fond of each other, but they were competitive,\u201d she says.\nBut Belushi soon found his groove and eventually became the show\u2019s star, thanks to his parody of Joe Cocker, his samurai character, his furious weather man and, eventually, the Blues Brothers with his close friend Dan Aykroyd. But there were some complaints about his behaviour.\n\u201cHe started to say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do the girls\u2019 scenes,\u2019\u201d says Pisano, meaning he would refuse to act in scenes written by women. Belushi was close to Radner and hugely respected her as a comedian, but other women on the show weren\u2019t impressed. Fellow SNL performer Jane Curtin has since described his behaviour as sexist.\n\u201cBy the second season, John was on covers of magazines and experiencing a whole new level of fame. It became overwhelming for him, and that was expressed in all the late nights, the drugs,\u201d says Michaels.\nIn 1976, Ramis, along with the National Lampoon\u2019s Doug Kenney and Chris Miller, wrote a comedy script about a college frat house. Universal Studios told them that unless they got Belushi to play the toga-wearing, compulsively eating character Bluto they wouldn\u2019t produce the movie.\n\u201cSo I went to New York to persuade him,\u201d says the director John Landis. \u201cWe met in my hotel and during the meeting Belushi makes a call down to room service. Soon after he left, and suddenly all these waiters walk in with plates and plates of food: spaghetti, shrimp cocktail, pie \u2013 everything on the menu. It was like something out of a Marx brothers movie.\u201d\nThe 70s was a decade of serious film-making \u2013 Five Easy Pieces, The Godfather \u2013 but Animal House became one of the era\u2019s defining movies. \u201cThat script captured the voice of the Boomer generation for comedy,\u201d says Reitman, who produced it. \u201cAnd John was central to it. Even though he was exhausted \u2013 flying between New York, where he was making SNL, and then out to Oregon for a few days a week to shoot Animal House \u2013 he was just terrific in it.\u201d\nBluto was ostensibly a minor character, a bully with a endless appetite. But Belushi imbued him with so much energy he is still the first thing everyone thinks of about Animal House.\n\u201cI ended up taking dialogue away from him because John could do so much with his face and body. John played him like Cookie Monster crossed with Harpo Marx, and even at Bluto\u2019s most aggressive, you still like him,\u201d says Landis.\nAt around this time, Belushi and Aykroyd started performing as the Blues Brothers. Belushi was now in the biggest movie, the coolest TV show and in the most exciting band around. Just walking down the road to a diner would take him an hour, getting past all the fans.\n\u201cA lot of people who reach celebrity status shut down and don\u2019t engage, but John always wanted to engage with everyone. But you have to be very grounded to cope with all those demands,\u201d says Pisano.\nThe most notable film he made at this point was 1941, Steven Spielberg\u2019s notorious turkey, and this became a pattern, with Belushi repeatedly making movies that failed to live up to expectations. The one exception was the second film that cemented his reputation: The Blues Brothers.\n\u201cBy the time we made Blues Brothers, John was a massive star, so it was different working with him on this than it was on Animal House \u2013 he couldn\u2019t go anywhere, and he had this awful addiction to cocaine,\u201d says Landis. \u201cWe hired a guy to watch him and there were some really scary moments during the making of that movie. People say now John was difficult to work with, but he wasn\u2019t. The only fight I had with him in all the time we worked together was about drugs, so it wasn\u2019t a temperament thing, it was a health thing.\u201d\nBelushi and Aykroyd were a hugely endearing double act, which was the secret to that film\u2019s success. But it was obvious that the energy Belushi had in Animal House was gone. In some Blues Brothers scenes, he seems barely engaged at all. \u201cIt was extremely frustrating. John was so great, but he wasn\u2019t able to give 100% in this movie. With addiction, you can\u2019t help someone unless they want it. It\u2019s like offering a drowning man your hand and they refuse it. It was terrible. He went from being this really sweet guy to someone hyper and maniacal,\u201d says Landis.\nAfterwards, Landis and his wife, the costume designer Deborah Nadoolman, would meet up with Belushi for dinner occasionally: \u201cWe\u2019d have a great time and then Deborah and I would go home. But John would go off to a punk club until 3am, and then another den of iniquity, then who knows. He was going 24 hours a day. But no matter what, he made friends everywhere \u2013 comedians, punks, whoever. Everyone loved John, because until the very end he was a warm, wonderful guy, and I\u2019m still angry about how things turned out.\u201d\nTwo years after finishing The Blues Brothers, Michaels met up with Belushi one evening in New York. \u201cHollywood was a whole new pressure for him, so, although he was still hilarious and the same John, he was so frantic. He\u2019d just been in it for too long.\u201d One month later, Belushi died in a hotel room after a drug dealer shot him up with cocaine and heroin. At the time, many put Belushi\u2019s drug addiction down to his sudden, dizzying fame. But those closest to him think that is simplistic.\n\u201cJohn always had an uneasiness in himself, and he was trying to fill it with something. I was an element, but I wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d says Pisano. \u201cAnd the drugs were a part of that \u2013 a big part of that. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure one\u2019s childhood has something to do with it.\u201d What\u2019s also clear from talking to those who knew Belushi, and from reading books about that era, is that while he did take a lot of drugs, many of the people around him were taking just as much.\n\u201cJohn was one of the big boys, but he wasn\u2019t out there on his own. I think maybe people didn\u2019t really know then how dangerous it was. Then John died and then they did,\u201d says Pisano.\nThe photos from his funeral show a generation of comedy stars in shock. One of the most touching images is a bereft Bill Murray putting a flower on Belushi\u2019s coffin. Aykroyd was working on a movie script for himself and Belushi when he got the call that his best friend had died, and that film became Ghostbusters. It is not hard to imagine Belushi in the role of Venkman, which cemented Murray\u2019s fame. \u201cIt was clear that his spirit was within Danny\u2019s script and I respected that,\u201d says Reitman, who directed Ghostbusters. \u201cWhen we started to create the character of Slimer, this rotund little ghost who eats a lot, it made me think of John. We called him Slimer, but it was really the spirit of John in all of our hearts.\u201d\nI ask Reitman about the comparisons between Murray and Belushi, and he points to the key difference between them:\n\u201cBill was always much more careful about fame,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s very careful about who he socialises with and he\u2019s very anti-Hollywood. He always wanted a much more simple life. Also, he never got into drugs, whereas John jumped in feet first.\u201d\nLandis sees another difference between them: \u201cI think John would have been a much, much bigger star than Bill Murray. Bill is always Bill Murray, whereas John was a real actor. There\u2019s very little in common between Bluto and Jake Blues.\u201d Belushi left behind a pitifully small body of enduring work that belied his potential. \u201cThere\u2019s all this mythology around John but the bottom line is he was a charming guy and a brilliant performer,\u201d says Landis. \u201cHe was strong like a tractor and smart like a bull and he really could have gone on to do anything.\u201d\nPart of the fascination with Belushi is that, in retrospect, he looks, as Pisano puts it, \u201clike a symbol of the times\u201d: the 60s dope-smoking hippy who brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to comedy in the 70s and was swallowed up by cocaine in the 80s. But his appeal lies in the man himself: there was nothing aloof or untouchable about him, as was the case with a lot of comedians of that era. There was something far more human, more emotional about Belushi.\nSo while audiences admired Chase, Steve Martin and Murray, they loved Belushi. He was as open and exposed as a sunflower, and while it ultimately contributed to his undoing, it is also why so many people still feel a connection to him.\n\u201cOne of my favourite things in my office is a Polaroid of the two of us from 1976,\u201d says Michaels. \u201cI look at it and there was an innocence to John then, a brightness. That\u2019s what I remember about him.\u201d",

        "content": "Small businesses and MPs say banks must be regulated to avoid further scandals\nThe government has been accused of caving to big banks and setting the scene for another financial scandal after refusing to heed calls by the influential Treasury select committee to regulate small business lending.\nBusiness lending is still not regulated in the UK, an anomaly that has left victims without the protection of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator.\n\u201cWhilst the FCA has noted that it is reasonable for government and parliament to assess what it regulates, the government has flat out \u2013 and wrongly \u2013 refused to bring commercial lending into regulation,\u201d said the House of Commons committee chair, Nicky Morgan.\n\u201cThe FCA must be given the powers to provide protection to SMEs now. If the government continues to bury its head in the sand, scandalous events such as those at RBS\u2019s Global Restructuring Group could re-occur.\u201d\nThe consequences of a lack of regulation were highlighted last year when the FCA concluded a four-year investigation into RBS\u2019s now-defunct GRG. Victims had accused GRG of pushing their businesses into failure before stripping them for assets that were later sold on. While the FCA found evidence of mistreatment, it said actions by GRG ultimately fell outside its jurisdiction, as commercial lending is unregulated in the UK.\nIn its response to the Treasury committee\u2019s recommendations, the government said it \u201cdoes not believe there is a clear case\u201d for regulation, which could raise costs for lenders that would be passed on to businesses. It added that bank behaviour had \u201cchanged significantly\u201d since the years following the 2008 banking crash, and noted that lenders were already signed up to a code of conduct for best practice.\nThe government\u2019s response also prompted criticism by the SME Alliance, which represents business banking victims, for caving in to banking interests.\nNikki Turner, director of the SME Alliance and a victim of the HBOS Reading fraud, said: \u201cThe government and the FCA are betraying British businesses, while acknowledging they are the backbone of this country, because they are unwilling to take on the big banks.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe idea that because the banks are not behaving as badly as they did a decade ago it\u2019s all OK is like inviting Hannibal Lecter to dinner because he hasn\u2019t killed anyone recently.\u201d",

        "content": "Former Nissan head says he is innocent, meaning he could remain in detention until trial begins\nCarlos Ghosn could remain in detention for several months after prosecutors indicted him on two new charges of financial misconduct, days after the former Nissan chairman insisted he had been wrongly accused.\nGhosn was charged with aggravated breach of trust and for understating his pay by 4.3 billion yen for three years through March 2018, the Tokyo district court said.\nHe had already been charged for underreporting his earnings by around 5 billion yen ($46m million) between 2010-15.\nThe third charge, of aggravated breach of trust, relates to allegations that he transferred 1.85 billion yen in personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008. Ghosn is also alleged to have used company funds to make unnecessary payments to a Saudi businessman.\nGhosn has repeatedly denied the allegations.\nHis lawyers said they would apply for their client to be released on bail, but conceded he was likely to remain in detention.\nThe 64-year-old, who led Nissan from near-bankruptcy two decades ago and transformed it into one of the world\u2019s most successful automakers, reportedly came down with a fever on Wednesday evening and was unable to undergo questioning, a day after he issued a public rebuttal of the allegations against him during a special court hearing.\nHis wife, Carole Ghosn, said authorities in Japan were refusing to provide details about his condition or allow his family to talk to medical staff at a Tokyo detention centre, where he has been held for more than 50 days.\n\u201cI recently learned that my husband is suffering from a high fever at the detention centre in Tokyo, but my information is limited to news reports as no one in his family has been allowed to contact him since 19 November,\u201d she said in a statement from Paris. \u201cWe are fearful and very worried his recovery will be complicated while he continues to endure such harsh conditions and unfair treatment.\u201d\nReports on Friday said Ghosn was recovering.\nHe is unlikely to be released on bail as long as he continues to proclaim his innocence, meaning he could remain in detention until his trial begins.\nNo date has been set for the trial, but his head lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, said his client could have to wait at least six months before his case is heard in court. \u201cGenerally speaking, it\u2019s extremely rare for a court to grant bail before a trial begins,\u201d Otsuru told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s our main concern, and I think Mr Ghosn is very troubled by this.\u201d\nGhosn\u2019s arrest, along with Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive who is alleged to have helped Ghosn underreport his salary, has cast doubt on the future of Nissan\u2019s three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors.\nKelly, who was released on bail on Christmas Day, has been charged with helping Ghosn underreport his pay, but not with aggravated breach of trust. He is reportedly receiving medical treatment in Japan for a chronic back problem.\nNissan and Mitsubishi sacked Ghosn days after his arrest, but he has been kept on as head of Renault. On Thursday, the French carmaker said it had found no evidence of illegal or fraudulent payments to Ghosn over the past two years, adding that it was continuing its audit.\nGhosn\u2019s rapid fall from grace has captivated Japan, with more than 1,000 people queuing to secure one of the 14 seats in the public gallery at his special hearing on Tuesday.\nA gaunt-looking Ghosn, who was led into the courtroom in handcuffs and with a rope tied around his waist, spoke of his \u201cgenuine love and appreciation\u201d for Nissan and insisted that he had acted \u201chonourably, legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company\u201d.\n\u201cI have always acted with integrity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in my several-decade professional career,\u201d he told a packed courtroom in his first public appearance since his arrest on 19 November.\n\u201cI have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.\u201d\nThe length of Ghosn\u2019s detention has prompted criticism of Japan\u2019s criminal justice system and the power of the country\u2019s public prosecutors, who can rearrest suspects several times over different allegations and question them for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present.\nGhosn, who has complained about the cold and the detention centre\u2019s rice-based diet, spends his free time reading but has reportedly been denied notepaper to write letters to his family.\nHe was initially kept in a tiny cell and slept on a futon, but has since been moved to a bigger cell with a bed, according to his lawyers.",

However, what is important here is we are putting in place significant investment dollars to protect this iconic part of Victoria.\u201d\nThe government plans to introduce legislation this year to establish a Great Ocean Road authority that will have oversight of measures taken to protect the tourist route.\n\u201cWe need to be very clear that our government is absolutely committed to understanding the impacts of climate change on our coastal environments and that also therefore means that we need to be very careful and considered and very much committed to all of the necessary investments to protect coastal environments,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said.\nBrian Westley, the acting chief regional roads officer at Regional Roads Victoria, said 2,000 soil rods were installed in the Mounts Bay area recently to reinforce the rock face, and rock nettings, retainer walls and rock walls were being installed.\nHe said VicRoads was \u201cconfident that we can make sure that this road in its current alignment is safe for generations to come\u201d.\n\u201cEvery site is assessed frequently and we\u2019ll continue to monitor them,\u201d he said.",

The news came at an anguished press conference in Melbourne, where the boy from Dunblane, who rose to become one of Britain\u2019s greatest tennis players alongside Fred Perry, was heartbreakingly candid about the hip injury that has left him with debilitating pain. \u201cI said to my team, \u2018Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon. That\u2019s where I would like to stop playing,\u2019\u201d said the former world number one, fighting back tears. \u201cBut I am not certain I am able to do that.\u201d\nMurray is steeling himself for what is \u201calmost certainly\u201d one last effort, at the Australian Open on Monday against the Spaniard Bautista Agut. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain for probably about 20 months now,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better. It hasn\u2019t helped loads. I\u2019m in a better place than I was six months ago, but still in a lot of pain. It has been tough.\u201d The tributes are flowing, and Kevin Mitchell, the Guardian\u2019s tennis correspondent, has filed an appreciation of \u201cone of our greatest ever sportsmen\u201d.\n\u2018Right at the time\u2019 \u2013 The benefits freeze is unlikely to be continued beyond 2020, according to Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. The Tory welfare policy introduced five years ago by George Osborne is estimated to cost some working families hundreds of pounds a year. In 2017 the Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicted it would drive almost half a million people into poverty by the time it came up for renewal in 2020. Rudd told Sky News: \u201cIt was the right thing to do at the time \u2026 it\u2019s got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off.\u201d Reacting last night, a Labour source said the freeze had cut incomes \u201cfor those most up against it\u201d while the rich and big business got tax cuts. \u201cRudd is flat wrong when she says it was the right policy.\u201d Today, Rudd will announce a partial rollback to the two-child limit on universal credit payments.\nComing up next, the fibre diet \u2013 Eating more fibre from less processed sources such as wholegrain cereals, pasta, bread, nuts and pulses can slash people\u2019s chances of heart disease and early death, according to a landmark review for the World Health Organisation. Fashionable low-carb diets may increase people\u2019s risk of heart disease because they throw out the fibre with the carbohydrates, the research suggests. University of Otago\u2019s Professor Jim Mann, who led the research, said: \u201cHere we have got very strong evidence that a high-fibre diet, which for the majority of people is at least high-ish in carbohydrates, has an enormous protective effect \u2026 Fibre-rich whole foods that require chewing and retain much of their structure in the gut increase satiety and help weight control and can favourably influence lipid and glucose levels.\u201d Another of the authors, Professor John Cummings from the University of Dundee, said: \u201cThis is the end of 50 years of researching dietary fibre \u2026 We need to get this written in stone and part of people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nBrexit clock ticks down \u2013 The Confederation of British Industry is urging MPs to back Theresa May\u2019s deal in next Tuesday\u2019s vote, warning that a hard Brexit would cut GDP by up to 8% and cost thousands of jobs. May has sought to win Labour support for her Brexit deal by making a direct offer to union leaders to beef up workers\u2019 rights. In his September conference speech, Jeremy Corbyn offered to support the prime minister\u2019s deal if she toughened up employment rights and environmental standards \u2013 though May has rejected his further condition of a permanent customs union. The PM has said the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, should explain to parliament why he allowed MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve\u2019s Brexit amendment. \u201cObviously the Speaker made a decision on a particular amendment; I was surprised at that decision,\u201d the PM said, repeating others\u2019 calls for Bercow to publish the advice he received from his clerks.\nBig questions answered \u2013 Fiona Bruce has hosted Question Time for the first time, and Mark Lawson was watching. \u201cBruce\u2019s opening link, in which she declared \u2018it\u2019s lovely to be here!\u2019, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show,\u201d Lawson writes.\n\u201cBut her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists \u2013 James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson \u2013 were as brisk and persistent as David Dimbleby\u2019s. The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.\u201d\nFatberg game-changer \u2013 \u201cThis is an important step in the battle against blockages. We\u2019ve all seen the impact of fatbergs, and we want to see fewer of them.\u201d Hear, hear Michael Roberts, chief executive of Water UK, who this morning hails the arrival of a \u201csafe to flush\u201d label for wet wipes. Many wipes are labelled as flushable when they don\u2019t break down quickly in the sewers, and clump together with fats, oils and grease on a massive scale. The results have included a 250-metre fatberg in Whitechapel in London in 2017, which weighed as much as 19 elephants, and a 64-metre fatberg discovered this week in Sidmouth, Devon.\nWith the US government in partial shutdown, the president continues to demand funding for his Mexican border wall.\nLauren Gambino, in Washington DC, and Bryan Mealer, in Texas, discuss how Trump\u2019s central campaign promise has led to this point of paralysis. Plus, John Harris looks back to the optimism of 1989.\nBetween daylight saving and obligatory early starts, we live at the mercy of \u201cofficial\u201d time \u2013 and many of us feel permanently out of sync. Most of us are not free to choose our work or school hours; we have little control over the lighting in our public spaces and external environment; and we are even forced to reprogram our internal clock twice a year because of daylight saving time.\nBut the German spa town of Bad Kissingen aims to be different. It has rebranded itself as the world\u2019s first ChronoCity \u2013 a place where internal time is as important as external time, and sleep is sacrosanct. In July 2013 the council contacted a chronobiologist about tweaking the lives and affairs of the town and its people to better accommodate their body clocks. Since then there have been victories with flexible working, but it is an evolving effort \u2013 the idea of abandoning daylight saving was defeated. Science journalist Linda Geddes explains an individual\u2019s \u201cchronotype\u201d is based on their sleep behaviour. It turns out there really is such a thing as a morning person or a night owl, and there is an argument for employers and society to accommodate that.\nCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s lawyer has confirmed authorities in Las Vegas have issued a warrant to collect DNA from the football star in the wake of allegations he raped a woman in the city in 2009. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r accepts Mauricio Pochettino \u201chas done a very good job\u201d at Tottenham and understands why he is being linked with the permanent Manchester United manager\u2019s role. The Southampton striker Charlie Austin has been handed a two-match suspension by the FA after admitting making a gesture towards Manchester City fans during the recent Premier League game at St Mary\u2019s. And Danny Cipriani has made a timely return from injury and will start at fly-half for Gloucester tonight against Munster in a must-win European Champions Cup tie at Kingsholm.\nOvernight, the car industry boss Carlos Ghosn has been indicted in Japan on fresh charges of financial misconduct. Asian stocks inched up to five-week highs after Jerome Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve will be patient about raising interest rates, while trade talks between Washington and Beijing moved to higher levels. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said China\u2019s vice-premier Liu He would \u201cmost likely\u201d visit Washington later in the month.\nThe FTSE is set to open higher and the pound is worth $1.276 and \u20ac1.107 at time of writing.\nThe Guardian\u2019s lead story is \u201cBlow to the low-carb diet as WHO report says fibre cuts early deaths\u201d, a story that also features on the front page of the Times. But that paper splashes with: \u201cMay calls on union chief in bid to save Brexit deal\u201d.\nThe Express is thrilled with Michael Gove\u2019s criticism of Corbyn\u2019s Brexit stance: \u201cFinally! Someone tells it as it is\u201d, while the Financial Times reports: \u201cFord and JLR slash thousands of EU jobs in drive to stem sales slide\u201d.

        "content": "The influence of evangelical Christianity is likely to become an important question as Trump finds himself dependent on them for political survival \nIn setting out the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East policy, one of the first things Mike Pompeo made clear to his audience in Cairo is that he had come to the region as \u201cas an evangelical Christian\u201d.\nIn his speech at the American University in Cairo, Pompeo said that in his state department office: \u201cI keep a Bible open on my desk to remind me of God and his word, and the truth.\u201d\nThe secretary of state\u2019s primary message in Cairo was that the US was ready once more to embrace conservative Middle Eastern regimes, no matter how repressive, if they made common cause against Iran.\nHis second message was religious. In his visit to Egypt, he came across as much as a preacher as a diplomat. He talked about \u201cAmerica\u2019s innate goodness\u201d and marveled at a newly built cathedral as \u201ca stunning testament to the Lord\u2019s hand\u201d.\nThe desire to erase Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, Donald Trump\u2019s instinctive embrace of autocrats, and the private interests of the Trump Organisation have all been analysed as driving forces behind the administration\u2019s foreign policy.\nThe gravitational pull of white evangelicals has been less visible. But it could have far-reaching policy consequences. Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo both cite evangelical theology as a powerful motivating force.\nJust as he did in Cairo, Pompeo called on the congregation of a Kansan megachurch three years ago to join a fight of good against evil.\n\u201cWe will continue to fight these battles,\u201d the then congressman said at the Summit church in Wichita. \u201cIt is a never-ending struggle \u2026 until the rapture. Be part of it. Be in the fight.\u201d\nFor Pompeo\u2019s audience, the rapture invoked an apocalyptical Christian vision of the future, a final battle between good and evil, and the second coming of Jesus Christ, when the faithful will ascend to heaven and the rest will go to hell.\nFor many US evangelical Christians, one of the key preconditions for such a moment is the gathering of the world\u2019s Jews in a greater Israel between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. It is a belief, known as premillenial dispensationalism or Christian Zionism \u2013 and it has very real potential consequences for US foreign policy.\nIt directly colours views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and indirectly, attitudes towards Iran, broader Middle East geopolitics and the primacy of protecting Christian minorities. In his Cairo visit, Pompeo heaped praise on Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, for building the new cathedral, but made no reference to the 60,000 political prisoners the regime is thought to be holding, or its routine use of torture.\nPompeo is an evangelical Presbyterian, who says he was \u201cbrought to Jesus\u201d by other cadets at the West Point military academy in the 1980s.\n\u201cHe knows best how his faith interacts with his political beliefs and the duties he undertakes as secretary of state,\u201d said Stan van den Berg, senior pastor of Pompeo\u2019s church in Wichita in an email. \u201cSuffice to say, he is a faithful man, he has integrity, he has a compassionate heart, a humble disposition and a mind for wisdom.\u201d\nAs Donald Trump finds himself ever more dependent on them for his political survival, the influence of Pence, Pompeo and the ultra-conservative white Evangelicals who stand behind them is likely to grow.\n\u201cMany of them relish the second coming because for them it means eternal life in heaven,\u201d Andrew Chesnut, professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University said. \u201cThere is a palpable danger that people in high position who subscribe to these beliefs will be readier to take us into a conflict that brings on Armageddon.\u201d\nChesnut argues that Christian Zionism has become the \u201cmajority theology\u201d among white US Evangelicals, who represent about a quarter of the adult population. In a 2015 poll, 73% of evangelical Christians said events in Israel are prophesied in the Book of Revelation. Respondents were not asked specifically whether their believed developments in Israel would actually bring forth the apocalypse.\nThe relationship between evangelicals and the president himself is complicated.\nTrump himself embodies the very opposite of a pious Christian ideal. Trump is not churchgoer. He is profane, twice divorced, who has boasted of sexually assaulting women. But white evangelicals have embraced him.\nEighty per cent of white evangelicals voted for him in 2016, and his popularity among them is remains in the 70s. While other white voters have flaked away in the first two years of his presidency, white evangelicals have become his last solid bastion.\nSome leading evangelicals see Trump as a latterday King Cyrus, the sixth-century BC Persian emperor who liberated the Jews from Babylonian captivity.\nThe comparison is made explicitly in The Trump Prophecy, a religious film screened in 1,200 cinemas around the country in October, depicting a retired firefighter who claims to have heard God\u2019s voice, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this.\u201d\nLance Wallnau, a self-proclaimed prophet who features in the film, has called Trump \u201cGod\u2019s Chaos Candidate\u201d and a \u201cmodern Cyrus\u201d.\n\u201cCyrus is the model for a nonbeliever appointed by God as a vessel for the purposes of the faithful,\u201d said Katherine Stewart, who writes extensively about the Christian right.\nShe added that they welcome his readiness to break democratic norms to combat perceived threats to their values and way of life.\n\u201cThe Christian nationalist movement is characterized by feelings of persecution and, to some degree, paranoia \u2013 a clear example is the idea that there is somehow a \u2018war on Christmas\u2019,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cPeople in those positions will often go for authoritarian leaders who will do whatever is necessary to fight for their cause.\u201d\nTrump was raised as a Presbyterian, but leaned increasingly towards evangelical preachers as he began contemplating a run for the presidency.\nTrump\u2019s choice of Pence as a running mate was a gesture of his commitment, and four of the six preachers at his inauguration were evangelicals, including White and Franklin Graham, the eldest son of the preacher Billy Graham, who defended Trump through his many sex scandals, pointing out: \u201cWe are all sinners.\u201d\nHaving lost control of the House of Representatives in November, and under ever closer scrutiny for his campaign\u2019s links to the Kremlin, Trump\u2019s instinct has been to cleave ever closer to his most loyal supporters.\nAlmost alone among major demographic groups, white evangelicals are overwhelmingly in favour of Trump\u2019s border wall, which some preachers equate with fortifications in the Bible.\nEvangelical links have also helped shape US alliances in the Trump presidency. As secretary of state, Pompeo has been instrumental in forging link with other evangelical leaders in the hemisphere, including Guatemala\u2019s Jimmy Morales and the new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. Both have undertaken to follow the US lead in moving their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem.\nTrump\u2019s order to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv \u2013 over the objections of his foreign policy and national security team \u2013 is a striking example of evangelical clout.\nThe move was also pushed by Las Vegas billionaire and Republican mega-donor, Sheldon Adelson, but the orchestration of the embassy opening ceremony last May, reflected the audience Trump was trying hardest to appease.\nThe two pastors given the prime speaking slots were both ardent Christian Zionists: Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor on record as saying Jews, like Muslims and Mormons, are bound for hell; and John Hagee, a televangelist and founder of Christians United for Israel (Cufi), who once said that Hitler and the Holocaust were part of God\u2019s plan to get Jews back to Israel, to pave the way for the Rapture.\nFor many evangelicals, the move cemented Trump\u2019s status as the new Cyrus, who oversaw the Jews return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple.The tightening of the evangelical grip on the administration has also been reflected in a growing hostility to the UN, often portrayed as a sinister and godless organisation.\nSince the US ambassador, Nikki Haley, announced her departure in October and Pompeo took more direct control, the US mission has become increasingly combative, blocking references to gender and reproductive health in UN documents.\nSome theologians also see an increasingly evangelical tinge to the administration\u2019s broader Middle East policies, in particular its fierce embrace of Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, the lack of balancing sympathy for the Palestinians \u2013 and the insistent demonisation of the Iranian government.\nEvangelicals, Chesnut said, \u201cnow see the United States locked into a holy war against the forces of evil who they see as embodied by Iran\u201d.\nIn a speech at the end of a regional tour on Thursday, Pompeo reprised the theme, describing Iran as a \u201ccancerous influence\u201d. \nThis zeal for a defining struggle has thus far found common cause with more secular hawks such as the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Trump\u2019s own drive to eliminate the legacy of Barack Obama, whose signature foreign policy achievement was the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, which Trump abrogated last May.\nIn conversations with European leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May, Trump has reportedly insisted he has no intention of going to war with Iran. His desire to extricate US troops from Syria marks a break with hawks, religious and secular, who want to contain Iranian influence there.\nBut the logic of his policy of ever-increasing pressure, coupled with unstinting support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, makes confrontation with Iran ever more likely.\nOne of the most momentous foreign policy questions of 2019 is whether Trump can veer away from the collision course he has helped set in motion \u2013 perhaps conjuring up a last minute deal, as he did with North Korea \u2013 or instead welcome conflict as a distraction from his domestic woes, and sell it to the faithful as a crusade.",

It is understood officials hope this will be in the coming days or weeks.\nThe total cost is in the region of \u00a310m, according to the DoH, which said it would publish the names of successful contractors when the tender process is complete and all contracts have been signed.\nA claim by the secretary of state for health, Matt Hancock, that his department had paid for 5,000 industrial-sized refrigerators, appears not to have been entirely accurate, however. While the warehouses have refrigeration capacity, the department has not purchased individual fridges, the Guardian has been told.\nInstead, a reply from one of Hancock\u2019s ministerial deputies, Stephen Hammond, to a parliamentary question from the Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb stated that agreements had been signed for storage, including refrigerated storage, for around 5,000 pallets.\nHammond told the Labour MP Luciana Berger, who asked a separate question, that funding had been agreed on the condition that the additional medicine warehousing capacity was in place in time to accommodate stockpiled medicines by the beginning of February.\n\u201cTo reassure participating companies, we have committed to treating all information received confidentially, securely and to using it only for the purposes of the department\u2019s programme. That means not introducing information about a company or a specific medicine into the public domain,\u201d he added.\nHowever, Berger called for more details to be made public, adding: \u201cThere should be nothing to stop the government telling us who the refrigeration contracts are being awarded to, even if that does not tell us which medicines they will contain.\n\u201cThe details we have been given so far are extremely open ended and I am particularly concerned after the debacle surrounding Seaborne Freight. We need to know who these contracts are being awarded to.\u201d\nLamb, a former health minister, said meanwhile: \u201cIt is really horrifying to see the Department of Health spending a fortune on fridges when there are so many other pressing priorities.\n\u201cWhen we know that a \u2018no-deal\u2019 is absolutely avoidable, this is a scandalous waste of money. The government will be held responsible for the reckless waste of public money.\u201d\nConcerns have already been expressed that Britain is running out of food warehousing space as retailers and manufacturers rush to stockpile amid growing fears of a no-deal Brexit. The Guardian reported in November that frozen and chilled food warehouses are fully booked for the next six months, with customers being turned away, industry representatives said.",

        "content": "Extending traditional sound design techniques to become part of the interface for voice apps\nComing from a career in music radio and podcast production, the idea that everything the user requires must be contained and communicated solely through audio is a familiar one to me.\nBefore arriving at the Voice Lab \u201cUI\u201d or user interface, was not part of my vocabulary; for me it was a term mostly associated with screens and visual communication. UI was \u201cother\u201d, as neither radio nor podcasts require much in the way of screens, nor indeed is there a way for the user to actively interface.\nAnd yet in thinking more about the ways users interact with audio of all kinds, it is clear that beyond the spoken word, there\u2019s a supplementary and well-established UI that exists in radio and podcasts; a language of sound design, of jingles, music beds, ambient sounds and audio branding. This language of cues, albeit one-directional, steers the listener towards important moments that might require focus, with musical stabs introducing headlines, or music beds communicating the show\u2019s progress. Podcasts such as the New York Times\u2019s The Daily, Vox\u2019s Today Explained, and the Guardian\u2019s own Today In Focus have each established their own UI languages that employ a palette of sounds and beds, all similar in timbre, producing a cohesive, guiding experience for the listener.\nAs a recent arrival to the field of voice, the novel ability to create bi-directional interactive audio experiences offers exciting opportunities to experiment in new ways. Frequent interactions between the user and app necessitate both parties to fully understand the rules of the game. So, is the legacy of radio and podcasts\u2019 nuanced UI enough for voice? Considering its now vital importance, must the previously \u201cshy and retiring\u201d background cues, step up and into the limelight, to embrace their now central and unambiguous role as lead actors?\nFor the Voice Lab\u2019s first project, having settled on the Year in Review interactive quiz idea, while also developing the code, UX design and scripts, we began thinking about how sound design could be used with the user interface. How do we communicate to the user when they can lean back and enjoy the experience? How do we communicate that it\u2019s time to lean forward and focus because a question is approaching? When is it the right time for a user to speak?\nHaving consumed endless varieties of TV and radio gameshow formats throughout all our lives, we are all well versed in this language, so for Year In Review we settled for familiar solutions; jazzy kitsch gameshow music, tension-building jeopardy music, and the use of a percussive \u201caudiocon\u201d dong respectively.\nSo, what thoughts did we have whilst establishing this language?\nFirst, although a frequent complaint during our weekly retrospectives was the inescapable earworm nature of the jazzy kitsch music, this music fulfilled an important function. The familiar presence of game-show jazz reflected the main body of the quiz, the heartland; a time when the user was being informed or entertained by the hosts, but little else was required.\nSecond, the transition from jazzy kitsch to tension-building jeopardy music was enough of a mood juxtaposition to communicate to users that a change from the passive experience was occurring. You might ask: \u201cWouldn\u2019t the tension-building music be enough to flag the arrival of a question without the need for kitsch jazz?\u201d Well, although the more scientifically-minded among you will be aghast, we decided the jazz was necessary throughout, based on a hunch. The hunch was that by establishing a constant presence, users become accustomed, and therefore in a sense blind to the music in general, instead understanding its significance on a more subconscious level, while focusing consciously on the speech. More on this in a moment.\nThird, having designed a simple \u201caudiocon\u201d dong that users understood, during testing we found the initial sound\u2019s long fade, although pleasing on the ear, led to users logically assuming that the microphone had opened when it hadn\u2019t, producing premature responses. As a result, a subsequent team meeting report of \u201can afternoon spent shortening dongs\u201d provoked muffled sniggers.\nExploring the hunch, a pre-release Year In Review play-through at a dinner party (the Voice Lab knows how to have fun) showed the audience at times listened to the speech within the jazz-laced sections of the quiz, and at other times talked among themselves, discussing recently revealed answers. Yet when the tension-building, jeopardy music returned, without instruction everyone re-focused, and leaned back into the experience, listening to questions and answering appropriately. In subsequent discussions, there was little mention of the music\u2019s function, despite its apparently clear impact on behaviour.\nAlthough this is anecdotal evidence, now that Year In Review is published, we will be analysing the conversation patterns in Dialogflow to see whether they indeed reflect this indication that, based on the sound design UI cues, users effectively understood the rules, and the transitions between the passive and active phases. If they did, the primary aim of the sound design in this project will have been achieved.\nAlthough the sound design UI appeared to have achieved it\u2019s primary aim, perhaps an unintended consequence of the language we employed was that by riffing on well-established tropes of TV and radio quiz shows, Year In Review was perceived similarly. By moving between 1970s The Price Is Right-style jazz to Who Wants To Be A Millionaire tension aesthetics, did we miss the opportunity to create a more cohesive sonic experience for the user?\nIt will be interesting to explore, by replacing the unambiguous and bold sound design of Year In Review with more nuanced and sonically consistent cues such as those deployed in The Daily, Today Explained and Today In Focus podcasts, whether a more immersive and rewarding user experience can be created, while still fulfilling the UI\u2019s primary function.",

        "content": "From inept waitressing to carnage in the countryside \u2026 personal anecdotes from a natural storyteller, which leave the reader squirming\nIf some people seem to get all the luck, others get exactly the opposite. They are disaster magnets. Perhaps that\u2019s one of the reasons why clowns are popular: they are suckers who are never given an even break. What\u2019s more, they never learn from their mistakes. Every time they spot a custard pie it is practically guaranteed to splatter them in the face, while if one clown has the bright idea of walking around with a ladder it isn\u2019t long before it bashes another clown on the head. The world of slapstick is one in which pratfalls are as unavoidable as gravity.\nReading Keggie Carew\u2019s collection of misadventures, it\u2019s tempting to conclude that she should probably go around wearing a red nose and a pair of comically outsized shoes, because she too never seems to learn from experience. Repeatedly she finds herself in situations where she confidently anticipates one thing and ends up with something much worse.\nIn 1990 she moves to Auckland with her husband, excited by \u201cthe possibilities for reinvention\u201d, and then spends an entire dinner talking to \u201ca hairy-faced bloke called Nigel\u201d, blithely unaware that he is actually the film star Sam Neill. Later she finds herself living in the English countryside and is convinced that she will spend hours happily staring up at the spangled night sky and counting the \u201ccopper freckles in a foxglove\u2019s throat\u201d. But soon she discovers that it is impossible to create a country garden without committing murder on an industrial scale: squishing plump aphids until green juice runs down her hands (\u201cNow I knew what was really meant by green fingers\u201d), and stamping on slugs or watching them drown \u201cin a floating ballet limbo\u201d. Et in arcadia ego.\nNone of this is likely to surprise readers of her previous book, the Costa award-winning Dadland, a memoir in which she set out to reconstruct the life of her father. A maverick former soldier whose life was slowly disintegrating through dementia, in his 80s he could still execute a perfect parachute roll after falling down a flight of stairs, turning potential disaster into a kind of performance art. Quicksand Tales is something of a sequel: a set of cheerfully haphazard personal anecdotes in which Carew takes Beckett\u2019s line \u201cFail again. Fail better\u201d and gives it a twist of her own. For if she is to be believed, she is not merely accident-prone; she is a connoisseur of catastrophe. Around every corner awaits a new banana skin; under every seat lurks another whoopee cushion. Almost every day, it seems, provides more evidence that for people like her a better motto would be \u201cFail again. Fail worse.\u201d\nStarting out as a writer, she enters one of her poems in a competition that promises expert feedback. When it arrives, she opens the envelope and notices that at the bottom of a largely blank form her reader has scrawled: \u201cTo be honest Plath on a bad day is better written than this.\u201d In Ireland, she storms round to the home of someone she suspects has been stealing from her, quietly lets herself in so that she can retrieve her possessions, and only realises when she looks at the photographs on the mantelpiece that she is burgling the wrong house.\nIf there\u2019s a moral here, it\u2019s that life rarely works in neat lines, even if that is precisely what a writer might want from it. Carew\u2019s preface tells the story of Picasso preferring pictures that were hung crookedly, as they told you much more about the owner than a neatly hung picture ever could, and Carew\u2019s own stories of \u201cincompetence, paranoia, insecurity, clumsiness \u2026 or pure bad luck at being in the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d are offered on a similar principle. As she points out, \u201cwe are all crooked pictures, busy in the lifelong pursuit of straightening ourselves\u201d, so if we shudder when reading about her experiences it is because we recognise that we have all done similarly daft things. The difference is that we tend to avert our eyes from them, whereas she is apparently willing to share every painful detail with us, a personal bloopers reel that stretches from her incompetence as a waitress (\u201cSorry, sorry\u201d) to her spine-jarring attempts at riding a camel in the Sahara.\nCarew is a natural storyteller, and each of these tales works like a perfectly paced standup routine, punctuated by some gorgeous phrase-making: the \u201ceerie shuddery whiteness\u201d of mating moths that \u201clook like Rorschach blots\u201d, or the strange sensation of intimacy we experience when reading a good book, \u201ca kind of one-to-one whispering\u201d. It\u2019s hard to make writing look this easy, but Carew\u2019s stories have the knack of easing the reader happily from page to page, leaving us squirming at the situations she finds herself in while secretly hoping that she won\u2019t escape them just yet.\nThe only exception is a story that relates how she and her husband decided to celebrate her birthday by booking a weekend break in a \u00a3300-a-night Scottish hotel. Inevitably everything goes wrong. The bedroom is spartan rather than tartan, and the only view of a nearby loch is from the bath. Then they wander along to the hotel restaurant for dinner, and discover the owner barring their way. They are eight minutes late. It is like a scene from Fawlty Towers with the volume turned up, and they soon leave the hotel to stay in a more relaxed B&B down the road. But that isn\u2019t enough for Carew. Long after she has decided that the first hotel is absurd, she continues to complain about it to everyone she meets. She frets about the pyjamas she left behind. In fact she is still annoyed four years later, when she hears that the hotel has gone bust. None of this is very funny, and it also underlines one of the dangers with Carew\u2019s kind of confessional writing: sometimes it reveals rather more than the author intended it to.\n Quicksand Tales is published by Canongate (RRP \u00a316.99).

        "content": "SSE Arena, BelfastBlurred genres, digital anxieties and giant iPhones\u2026 the 1975 strive for the zeitgeist as they open their new UK tour\nSinger Matt Healy is standing on a hydraulic lift at the back of the arena stage, rubbing his slicked-back, natural-coloured dark hair. Dressed down in athleisure and a V-neck top, he turns his back to the crowd and regards the massive screen behind his band, the 1975, with curiosity.\nThe visuals on this first night of the band\u2019s latest tour have been pretty impressive thus far. \u201cModernity has failed us,\u201d runs a line from Love It If We Made It (played later in the set), a stark statement from the band\u2019s persuasive third album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. But the 1975 do have some uses for the tech age. There is a lot of very shiny stagecraft deployed in tonight\u2019s gig, bumping them up into the role of arena innovators.\nFor Sincerity Is Scary, Healy unexpectedly re-enacts the song\u2019s video in a pair of chunky headphones and a rabbit-eared hat. A vast hi-res projection of a New York brownstone behind him, Healy cavorts like Michael Jackson down a sneaky treadmill that runs the width of the front of the stage. The band \u2013 drummer and producer George Daniel, bassist and keyboard player Ross MacDonald, guitarist and keyboard player Adam Hann \u2013 play on, safely behind a row of lights.\nThe stage set is full of moving light-boxes and glowing squares \u2013 nods to this band\u2019s on-off obsession with rectangles. The quadrilaterals tilt, framing and reframing the action, referencing the original neon shape that appeared on the cover of the band\u2019s 2013 self-titled debut album. (Fans have been known to get tattoos of \u201cthe box\u201d.) It is, you reflect, a bit like a Facebook game of \u201chow many rectangles can you see? 92% FAIL this simple test\u201d writ large: there are zillions of them. A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships (their third No 1), dwells at length, too, on how those rectangles in our pockets suck us in, distract us and warp our sense of ourselves.\nIt\u2019s hardly the most original of modern complaints, but the 1975 are credible emissaries from a land of surfaces and mistrust: they nail the ongoing experience of how our feelings are being manipulated by our technology more perceptively \u2013 and more tunefully \u2013 than most. Radiohead, for one, never had a pop banger as blithe as the 1975\u2019s sweetly nagging TooTimeTooTimeTooTime, which considers infidelity while recalling Justin Bieber and Afro-swing.\nAnd they are unlikely to have deployed dancers. The 1975 have always occupied a grey area between pop and rock \u2013 indeed, their creation myth involves shrugging off such delineations and making funky 80s arena guitar tunes, against the advice of the entire music industry. Most of tonight\u2019s show feels more like pop in part because of two dancers, the Jaiy twins \u2013 thoughtfully non-sexualised in white overalls \u2013 whose dance steps Healy ably mimics.\nIt\u2019s hard to conjure real cleverness out of large venues, where the tendency is to have people flying about for the sake of it. But this band, armed with such a heavy album, manage to pull off a deft conjuring trick or two.\nAs Healy gazes up at the back wall during The Ballad of Me and My Brain, a track from their previous record, I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful, Yet So Unaware of It, the backdrop buzzes with TV static. As Healy touches the screen, it warps into dazzling colour.\nHe then steps up, and into the static. From the side, it looks as though he has vanished. It is a moment that draws a collective gasp from the crowd: it\u2019s not so much that Healy has broken the fourth wall, it\u2019s that the fourth wall has eaten him.\nSwiftly, the projections shift and Healy is visible once more, standing on a shelf inside the backdrop for one more audacious reveal. The singer is framed to look as though he is inside an actual iPhone, the word \u201chello\u201d in an Apple-like font above his head. It\u2019s quite a cool feat: toying with depth perception, then making people take pictures of you with their phones, standing inside a phone.\nAfter this, the rest of the band\u2019s set goes by in a blur of dazzling, hyper-lurid digital visuals, the trajectory slightly downhill. It\u2019s not that the 1975 lack for momentum \u2013 they just fail to pull the rug out from under the crowd in quite the same way as before.\nHealy, too, is more of an enigmatic presence tonight than he has been previously. It might be a case of first-night concentration, or perhaps, a clearer head than in years gone by. Whatever: he prioritises not falling off the travelator, rather than enacting his previous brand of foppish dissolution, or saying a great deal between songs. You can hardly blame him \u2013 the last time he was loose-lipped, he had to issue a clarification of his views on misogyny in rock and hip-hop.\nWhen he came out as a recovering heroin user last summer, the internet did not exactly wilt from the shock. Few artists have gone about their business with as much gusto for rock\u2019n\u2019roll cliche as this 29-year-old.\nTattooed, frequently shirtless, when younger, Healy channelled the brash sensuality of 80s stars like INXS\u2019s Michael Hutchence while simultaneously raising a millennial eyebrow at the absurdity of it all; tonight, he seems more contained, even as he gambols around.\nThe jaded might wonder if smoking opiates was on some bucket list of poses for Healy. More compassionate observers might ponder the need for unquiet minds to self-medicate. Healy, for his part, has been candid in song and interviews about his insecurities and suicidal thoughts, which populate this album even more audibly than before.\nAs a result, he has emerged as an articulate personality increasingly in tune with anxious times. Tonight, I Like America & America Likes Me (named after a Joseph Beuys performance art piece where he spent three days in a room with a coyote) marks the height of over-stimulation \u2013 our collective overload, and Healy\u2019s personal version. Layered with Auto-Tune, Healy sings about his fear of death while the track hits a kind of auditory and retina-singeing peak, tilting at Xanax-addled trap hip-hop.\nHaving survived the age of 27 \u2013 when Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain died \u2013 the only rock cliches left for the 1975 to embrace are travelling in different tour buses and making a documentary about their group therapy, as Metallica once did.\nCertainly, the album they made around Healy\u2019s stint in rehab in Barbados is a sprawling, genre-hopping mashup that reflects both our era of always-on excess, and Healy\u2019s particular responses to his own internal cacophony. That such harrowing fare can be this refreshing live is a coup.",

        "content": "The star of Hamilton and A Star Is Born on growing up in Brooklyn, accidentally becoming an actor and working with Lin-Manuel Miranda\nAnthony Ramos is rapping down the phone: \u201cI\u2019m past patiently waiting / I\u2019m passionately smashing every expectation / Every action\u2019s an act of creation \u2026 Um \u2026 I can\u2019t remember \u2026 Sorry. I\u2019ve been out of the show for two and half years.\u201d Much has happened since Ramos last heard those lyrics on the Broadway stage, in the original production of Hamilton. Ramos\u2019s dual role as John Laurens/Philip Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s all-conquering musical has catapulted him into a career that\u2019s so impossibly busy, you can forgive him for losing track a little. Although the words do come back to him moments later: \u201cOh yeah \u2013 I\u2019m laughin\u2019 in the face of casualties and sorrow / For the first time, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 past tomorrow.\u201d\nJust in the last year, we\u2019ve seen Ramos as Lady Gaga\u2019s best friend in A Star Is Born, as clownish b-boy Mars Blackmon in Spike Lee\u2019s Netflix series She\u2019s Gotta Have It, and most recently as a conflicted witness to a police shooting in indie drama Monsters and Men, which won a prize at Sundance last year, and is released in the UK on 18 January. There\u2019s more to come, including a sort-of reunion with Miranda (more of which later), the next Godzilla instalment, and the crime thriller he\u2019s currently shooting in Massachusetts with Liam Neeson, titled Honest Thief. Drama, comedy, singing, dancing, Hollywood, Broadway \u2013 talk about smashing every expectation.\nMonsters and Men brings Ramos back to where he started. It is set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn; a stone\u2019s throw from his native Bushwick. His own life could have turned out much like that of his character Manny\u2019s, he says. Of Puerto Rican descent, Ramos grew up in the projects, one of three children, regularly facing eviction and seeing his mother struggle to put food on the table. Manny also lives in the projects with his mother, his pregnant girlfriend and his young daughter. He\u2019s just got a job, but is presented with a dilemma when he films police shooting a black neighbour outside a convenience store on his phone. The moment consciously recalls a real-life incident in nearby Staten Island in 2014, when Eric Garner died after police used a chokehold to subdue him: the struggle was filmed by a friend of Garner\u2019s.\n\u201cThe world you see in the film \u2013 that was pretty much the world I grew up in,\u201d says Ramos. \u201cIt was hard, man. It was hard knowing that you walk into a store sometimes and you\u2019re wearing a baseball cap and a hoodie and some baggy jeans, or your skin is a little darker, and the clerk is just staring at you a little bit harder. The cops treat you a little differently.\u201d He has friends in jail, neighbours who died. \u201cNow people in America are starting to feel what people in the hood have felt for years because now you can see it on a video, but we\u2019ve already been seeing this shit for years.\u201d\nRamos\u2019s ticket out of that life came almost accidentally. He casually auditioned for a school play only to find himself cast in a major role. \u201cI was like, \u2018Read a script? I don\u2019t even do my homework. What makes you think I\u2019m gonna learn all these lines?\u2019\u201d But his drama teacher persisted. Two years later, after he failed to apply for college, she helped him win a scholarship to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.\nBut opportunities for an aspiring Hispanic actor were so thin on the ground, that he thought about quitting. So, about five years ago, when he found himself auditioning for an in-development musical called Hamilton, performing the character Hamilton\u2019s song My Shot (the one he was rapping down the phone to me) to Miranda and his team, it really was his shot. \u201cI was just pouring it out, bro. I was singing those words as the character, but I was really singing those words as myself, cos I was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m not throwing away my shot for nothing. I\u2019m about to give you every ounce I got in my body and soul and mind and my spirit.\u2019 That was kind of how it popped off.\u201d\nIt was the second time Ramos had auditioned in front of Miranda. The first was four years earlier, for a national tour of In the Heights, Miranda\u2019s previous musical, set among the Hispanic community in Washington Heights, Manhattan. He came close but didn\u2019t get the part. Everyone came to see Hamilton, though. Ramos performed in front of the Obamas, and Mike Pence, on the eve Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 the night a fellow cast member made a gracious plea to the vice-president for tolerance. \u201cThe most important thing for me about that night, more than the speech, is that Mike Pence saw that story unfold in front of him. He will never be able to unsee it,\u201d says Ramos.\nSpike Lee also came along and cast Ramos in She\u2019s Gotta Have It \u2013 a series based on his feature debut, with Ramos in the role Lee originally played himself. For A Star Is Born, he had to go the conventional audition route and was one of the final pieces of the puzzle, he says, but was \u201csuper-honoured\u201d to be part of it. \u201cThat movie was special from the moment we were all on set,\u201d he says. He had a blast, popping champagne on private jets with Lady Gaga (in character, of course), and watching her singing to Bradley Cooper in the parking lot scene: \u201cShe was just freestyling, coming up with lyrics on the spot.\u201d \n  Today, Ramos considers Miranda a mentor. \u201cLin has taught me a lot. In conversations we\u2019ve had but also just in the way he goes about his business. I was speaking to him one time, I cracked a joke and said: \u2018Oh man, I gotta stop talking hood.\u2019 And Lin said, \u2018You don\u2019t ever have to change the way you speak; you just have to make sure people understand you.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Damn! Punch to the gut!\u2019\u201d Now it has come full circle. Ramos\u2019s next gig is the movie version of In the Heights. He is playing the lead, Usnavi \u2013 the role Miranda himself played in the original stage version.\nFor the first time, Ramos is thinking past tomorrow, you could say, but not too hard. \u201cI\u2019m being more selective about what I do, but really it\u2019s just, if I love it, I\u2019ma do it. It\u2019s that simple. I could be paid $100 or a million. The goal for me right now is just to do stuff that feeds me, that fuels me to be the best person I can be and put out the best stuff I can put out.\u201d\n Monsters and Men is released on 18 January.\nThis article was amended on 11 January 2019 to correct the sentence that said Ramos sang My Shot in the Broadway production of Hamilton. In fact it was sung by Lin-Miranda Manuel; Ramos performed the song in his audition.",

        "content": "Twenty years ago a new movement blending eastern sounds with electro and drum\u2019n\u2019bass arrived to give a generation of young British Asians a vibrant new voice. Why did it fade away so quickly?\nWhen most Brits think of Asian music \u2013 if they do at all \u2013 they might conjure a twanging sitar and the high-pitched vocals of a Bollywood dance sequence blaring in an Indian restaurant, or the meditative chimes and chanting of a yoga session. In reality, of course, Asian music is a vast and diverse series of musical disciplines, and one that had been reduced, in the UK, to the reserve of anoraks and first-generation immigrants. But in the 90s, a scene came along to change all of that.\nTwenty years ago, the Asian underground was born. A product of the first wave of Asian immigration into the UK in the early 60s and their children growing up in a newly diversifying society \u2013 one imbued with the racism of the National Front, as well as with a burgeoning multiculturalism from the Caribbean and west Africa \u2013 the music these first-generation British Asians made was full of internal tension. It was a mix of Indian classical instrumentals, Bollywood singing, jazz and the 90s club sounds of dub, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and jungle.\nBritish Asian music since may be best remembered for its most commercial moments \u2013 Panjabi MC\u2019s 2002 hit Mundian to Bach Ke, R&B poster-boy Jay Sean, and Cornershop\u2019s No 1 Brimful of Asha, a reference to Bollywood singer Asha Bhosle. But the Asian underground encompassed a breadth of music on the fringes, as well as in the charts: there was the head-scratching mix of ragga, synths and Indian classical in the Asian Dub Foundation; the sitar-electronica of Black Star Liner; producer Bally Sagoo\u2019s Bollywood remixes; and the time-stretched drum\u2019n\u2019bass of Tabla Beat Science. It was Talvin Singh and Nitin Sawhney, though, who were its most critically acclaimed and experimental artists.\nBoth producers released their seminal albums in 1999: Sawhney\u2019s fourth record, Beyond Skin, and Singh\u2019s debut OK. OK won the Mercury prize in 1999 and Beyond Skin was nominated the following year. The records are very different; Sawhney\u2019s incorporates vocal samples on his family\u2019s migratory experience as well as jazz, Indian classical instrumentation and hip-hop, while Singh\u2019s focuses on the dancefloor, stretching frenetic drum patterns over sub-bass and sitar.\nBoth have gone on to longstanding careers as composers, yet the Asian underground movement quickly faded. \u201cI always disliked the term Asian underground,\u201d Sawhney says. \u201cThe whole idea of the movement was that cultural change could occur and that Asians would feel they have a relevance and identity within the wider culture \u2013 that\u2019s what was exciting. Not this idea that we were underground, but that we were part of music.\u201d\nShabs Jobanputra, founder of the Outcaste record label that released Sawhney\u2019s Beyond Skin, was one of the few record label executives championing this nascent scene in the early 1990s. \u201cOutcaste started in 1994 because I wanted to see if I could form a movement to express my culture,\u201d he says of its beginnings as a club night in west London. \u201cInitially, it was hard to get people down to the club because it was something so different but by 1997, when we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Indian independence, 800 people turned up to our 200-capacity venue. We\u2019d never seen anything like it.\u201d\nOne of the most exciting features of Outcaste as both a night and a label was this sense of difference. \u201cThe crowd was super-mixed,\u201d Jobanputra says. \u201cWe had Asian kids who felt they could come along and be proud of their culture, inviting their white and black friends and whoever else along without apologising.\u201d\nComing to the UK in the 60s as a refugee from Idi Amin\u2019s ethnic repression of the Indian minorities in Uganda, Jobanputra says he was \u201cincredibly heartened by the reaction we got \u2013 being able to assimilate into this new culture, as well as being able to define my own sense of identity. It was a fantastic feeling to be a proud Asian person working in music.\u201d\nWhile Jobanputra and Sawhney were hosting Outcaste, across town at Hoxton\u2019s Blue Note was Talvin Singh\u2019s Anokha. Where Outcaste explored the jazz- and funk-influenced fringes of the underground, Singh\u2019s Anokha was more raw, inviting punk bands to play along with his tabla sets and incorporating high-energy jungle into the mix. British Asian composer Shammi Pithia says this form of nightlife was transformative for the community. \u201cWhen I went to the nights, I saw Asian people in a different light,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually I would associate the community with family and being at home but there, people could do their own thing and enjoy themselves like anyone else. There was a sense that this music was for us and by us, and that was very powerful.\u201d\nSo why did that power fade? Jobanputra feels that the novelty of the movement\u2019s difference wore off and the scene suffered. \u201cIt creatively ran out of steam,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to regurgitate the same ideas.\u201d Instead, he now sees British Asian success in individual acts making music, rather than a collaborative movement, having signed producer Naughty Boy in 2012 \u2013 who went on to record with Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 and developing grime act Koomz. \u201cSubcultures are needed to foster a sense of identity,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you can\u2019t pin the Asian identity to things as easily now because the culture has moved on. The younger generation doesn\u2019t have any inhibition; they can be themselves without questioning. Whereas we needed something to rail against to bring us together.\u201d\nSawhney has more controversial opinions. \u201cAfter 9/11, something shifted and I didn\u2019t hear of Asian acts in the mainstream,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like a segregation took place and maybe that\u2019s because we were having a war on a country of brown people and that made the country far more intolerant of minorities.\u201d Sawhney says record label A&Rs are less willing to gamble on acts now: \u201cIf I was to experiment like I was in the 90s now and tried to get signed, it would be bloody tough going.\u201d\nBut if we take Jobanputra\u2019s more optimistic view, there may no longer be the need for a separate British Asian scene because integration is becoming more commonplace and acts can exist within the industry while embodying a new multiculturalism. Acts like pop-rap producer Steel Banglez references heritage in his name \u2013 the religious \u201csteel bangle\u201d, or kara, worn by Sikhs \u2013 but he makes music that is closer to grime and afrobeats than anything resembling the Asian underground. Similarly, rapper Premz, one of BBC Asian Network\u2019s 2019 Future Sound winners, makes music that fuses Bollywood samples with UK hip-hop to create his own take on grime. \u201cWhen we go into the studio, we don\u2019t aim to make an Asian-sounding record,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we\u2019re now in a time where it\u2019s OK to be proud of your culture, so it feels natural for me to incorporate that into my music.\u201d\nShammi Pithia, meanwhile, is emphatic that the underground has allowed for this embracing of marginalised identity. \u201cListening to Beyond Skin was revolutionary,\u201d he says. \u201cI realised I could mix genres in one song and I didn\u2019t need to justify it. It\u2019s probably the most important album I\u2019ve ever heard since it made me realise that Indian music isn\u2019t just for Indian people. It made me proud to be a British Asian musician.\u201d\nPerhaps, then, the shedding of the \u201cunderground\u201d tag is a good thing: a symptom of acceptance. \u201cNow, British Asians aren\u2019t just underground, they\u2019re working in all fields,\u201d Pithia says. \u201cTalvin and Nitin\u2019s albums set the pathway for the music to grow far above the underground \u2013 in a sense, \u2018underground\u2019 may have been an oppressive term.\u201d Even Sawhney admits that \u201cin the 90s I was making a strong point of integrating Indian classical music into everything I did deliberately, but nowadays I\u2019m at the point where if I want to write music that has nothing to do with being Asian, I can do that also.\u201d\nAs such, he has been commissioned to create a new version of that most British song of all: the national anthem. \u201cI\u2019m travelling around the country and creating a multicultural anthem in response to Brexit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to see Britain as a multicultural society now more than ever. So, I\u2019ll use my heritage if I need to, since we can\u2019t keep up a culture of exclusion \u2013 there needs to be representation across the whole of the mainstream.\u201d\n Nitin Sawhney\u2019s Brexit \u2013 A Rational Anthem for a National Tantrum, is at the Barbican, on London, 23 February.",

        "content": "It\u2019s January and no NBA team has won more games than the revamped Raptors. So why is everyone in Toronto worried?\nIn Toronto, it\u2019s the hope that kills you.\nIt\u2019s a sports-mad place boasting competitive teams across a multitude of codes but lots of chaos and a dearth of success. And even when the city\u2019s franchises manage to get a taste of it, the fizz is fleeting.\nBaseball\u2019s Blue Jays claimed back-to-back World Series titles in 1992 and 1993, and then didn\u2019t reach the playoffs for 21 years. The Maple Leafs have won more Stanley Cups than all but two NHL clubs, but none in more than 50 years. As recently as 2012, they were voted the most embarrassing team to support.\nToronto FC bounced from one humiliating episode to the next before their MLS Cup triumph in 2017. But following the pattern of self-destruction, the joy was short-lived and they failed to qualify for the postseason earlier this year.\nCanada\u2019s largest city has a difficult relationship with winning. It doesn\u2019t happen very often and on the rare occasions when it does, it doesn\u2019t really know what to do with it.\nAnd that\u2019s why there remains an unshakable spectre overhanging the Toronto Raptors this season.\nAfter a seismic summer defined by splashy transactions, the team has transitioned impressively and remains well in contention to finish at the top of the Eastern Conference for the second successive year. The Raptors are not a side accustomed to drama and conflict so, considering the offseason saw the firing of long-time coach Dwane Casey and the trade of the legendary DeMar DeRozan, that\u2019s no small feat.\nThe recriminations and finger-pointing still linger but going by the performances so far this term, there\u2019s no scar tissue. The players seem invested in Nick Nurse, who was brought on by Casey as an assistant back in 2013 before sliding into the lead role in June. And despite the trauma of the DeRozan trade, the gamble of bringing in Kahwi Leonard as his replacement has worked a treat.\nMany wondered which Leonard would show up in Toronto. He\u2019d been immense for San Antonio and was voted MVP when the Spurs beat Miami in the 2014 finals. There were back-to-back All-NBA first team appearances in 2016 and 2017, too. But things ended bitterly last season when a quad injury led to a prolonged absence and tension regarding best treatment. His relationship with Gregg Popovich broke down and he looked for a way out.\nBut, when Toronto was first mooted as a possible destination, it was claimed that Leonard was underwhelmed, had \u2018no desire\u2019 in going there and much preferred a switch to his hometown of Los Angeles.\nStill, with some pressure on his shoulders, he\u2019s smiled, stepped up and, most importantly, delivered in the big games. He\u2019s poured in 30 or more points on 13 occasions, including a career-high 45-point haul against Utah on New Year\u2019s Day.\nAnd when he was mercilessly booed and kept quiet on his much-vaunted return to San Antonio two days later, there was no moodiness. When he stepped to the free throw line during the second quarter and thousands of home fans screamed \u201ctraitor\u201d relentlessly, there was no reaction. And when the game was done, there was a laugh, a joke and warm embrace with Popovich.\nAnyone expecting Leonard to kick up a fuss and spark a war in the Raptors\u2019 locker-room has been left waiting.\nOf course, it hasn\u2019t all been about him.\nKyle Lowry, Danny Green and Pascal Siakam have excelled and, quite rightly, much has been made of the roster\u2019s depth. With the Eastern Conference seldom as wide open, it\u2019s not outlandish to look at the Raptors as favorites to reach their first NBA finals and genuine championship contenders.\nHowever, you can\u2019t shake the past: Toronto have been here very recently.\nThe was last season\u2019s record-breaking campaign: 59 wins and the conference\u2019s No 1 seed entering the playoffs for the first time in club history. Then it all came crashing down when they were whitewashed by LeBron James and the Cavaliers for a second straight year.\nIt was a humiliating end to a season that had been bursting with promise. In 2017, team president Masai Ujiri spoke of a \u2018culture reset\u2019. Alas, nothing had changed. Despite all the talk, all the hype, all of those Atlantic Division titles, there was still a valley of emptiness when it mattered most.\nFor Ujiri, it seemed that mindset was a big problem under Casey, who had performed small miracles to transform the Raptors from persistent punchline to Eastern Conference heavyweights. Though they had clearly blossomed throughout Casey\u2019s seven years in charge, there seemed little belief within the team as they headed into high-profile matchups against LeBron.\nSo Ujiri rolled the dice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve done in my life,\u201d he later told reporters of his decision to fire Casey, who was voted Coach of the Year by his peers two days earlier and who\u2019d go on to be named NBA Coach of the Year too. But, Ujiri made sure to add that it was a \u2018very difficult but necessary step\u2019.\nWhen the DeRozan trade followed in mid-summer, it was representative of the Raptors\u2019 new era: ruthless, business-oriented and cold-blooded.\nMoving on the team\u2019s biggest star and bringing in Leonard was a bold decision. Again, certainly not what the Raptors were known for. Pushing out both Casey and DeRozan \u2013 seven- and nine-year veterans of the organization, respectively \u2013 was hardly coincidental. Gone was that cliche Canadian niceness. In Ujiri\u2019s eyes, there was little space for emotion if the Raptors were going to push hard for a championship.\nBut it has been tough for fans to properly park the nostalgia and embrace the new version of the side. Casey\u2019s future had been a frequent sports-bar discussion ever since the 2018 playoff series with the Cavs took a familiar turn. He contributed so much to the team\u2019s development and immersed himself in the city. Most difficult of all was that Casey, as Lowry once opined, was \u2018just a nice fucking man\u2019.\nFans were also peeved by the fact that DeRozan was blindsided by the trade to San Antonio.\nHowever, not every meaningful or impactful relationship was intended to last forever.\nLeonard becomes a free agent at the end of the season and Ujiri would do well to persuade him to stick around. But will supporters care too much if he helps the Raptors land the conference title \u2026 or better?\nNurse is a rookie NBA coach, plucked from the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA\u2019s developmental G League and previously a two-time coach of the year in the British Basketball League. But, crucially, his players like him. Last month, he was fined $15,000 after criticizing officials for not protecting Leonard enough during a loss in Denver. The support wasn\u2019t lost on Leonard, who spoke afterwards about Nurse having his back. And the coach\u2019s passion wasn\u2019t lost on fans either.\nThe Raptors are dealing with some newfound anxiety this season. Given the commitment to their radical change in approach, there\u2019s an expectation and anticipation now, which hasn\u2019t always settled well with Toronto sports teams.\nAnd while the regular season has been a big success, the playoffs will offer plenty of nerves, particularly with LeBron not around to get in their heads this time. On paper, they\u2019re in a much stronger position than last year. But considering the investment in the short term, there seems immense pressure on the team doing something special in 2019. If that doesn\u2019t happen, and Leonard walks in the summer while Ujiri is faced with starting over again, will it have all been worth it?\nThen again, perhaps the new-era Raptors, who are intent on looking to the future rather than the past, won\u2019t care too much.",

Its follow-up opens with a track that references that period of disquieting soul-baring in the form of a meta-confessional: I Told You Everything has Van Etten divulging the details of her traumatic past to a sympathetic new partner, but not the listener. It\u2019s a move that acknowledges the musician\u2019s suffering but also inches the story forward, hinting that the New Jersey native has a different life now (a suggestion confirmed by her hectic-sounding recent biography: over the past four years she has had a child, taken up acting and started studying for a degree in counselling). Change is something echoed in the sound of Remind Me Tomorrow too, a collection that sees Van Etten edge away from her trademark guitar and towards drones, piano and vintage synths.\nVan Etten is not alone in her decision to stop strumming and shift to electronic instrumentation instead \u2013 it feels as if half the rock and indie acts on the planet have made a similar move over the past few years. But the musician never appears to be jumping on a bandwagon. Instead, this new mode simply gives her stock-in-trade \u2013 gorgeous, timeless melodies, lyrical introspection and raw, plaintive vocals \u2013 a new gloss, one that veers between a buoyant 80s nostalgia and a more sinister sheen. Songs in the former camp include lead single Comeback Kid, which matches its warm portrait of delinquent adolescence with a cantering breakbeat and stuttering synth line; Malibu, a tribute to late 20th-century youth via the medium of a small red car; and the stupendously catchy, Springsteen-esque Seventeen. Counterbalancing these instantly memorable, flab-free slices of retro cheer are more obtuse atmospherics: Jupiter 4 is a ghostly love song that recalls Suicide; Memorial Day a fug of eerie Americana. Whether Van Etten is brooding on the present or pining for the good old days, however, the general impression remains the same: this ambitious, arresting album feels like the work of an artist wielding her considerable talents with newfound confidence and conviction.",

It is not the first time that Catalan side have been linked with the twinkle-toed Brazilian but with the player now 18 months away from a free transfer and seven months away from turning 31 this could be the moment they get their man.\n\u201cYet with Malcom failing to impress in La Liga,\u201d the Mirror continues, \u201cChelsea could decide they are not interested in him and may feel \u00a350m is not enough for Willian.\u201d That certainly seems the more likely conclusion to the story at the moment, with the Telegraph saying Chelsea have already rejected the offer. \u201cChelsea regard Willian as a key member of their squad and are looking to strengthen during the window rather than let first-team regulars go,\u201d they sniff.\nMarko Arnautovic\u2019s brother, Danijel, has revealed that the player desperately wants to move to China immediately. \u201cWest Ham bought Marko for peanuts. Now they have a fantastic offer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is his great desire that West Ham accept the offer from China.\u201d West Ham however are \u201crefusing to be bullied\u201d, according to the Sun, and plan to hold him to his lengthy current deal. The Hammers are also keen to sign Jonjo Shelvey, even if \u2013 according to the Mail \u2013 they face \u201cfierce resistance\u201d from his current club, Newcastle. \u201cManuel Pellegrini admires Shelvey and would jump at the possibility of bringing him to the London Stadium,\u201d they report, but \u201cNewcastle boss Rafa Ben\u00edtez would not sanction the sale unless he was able to bring in a suitable replacement.\u201d Whether Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Christopher Nkunku, a 21-year-old midfielder with whom they are linked today \u2013 along with his 19-year-old defensive teammate Stanley Nsoki \u2013 counts is unknown.\nRumours that Arsenal are about to sign Yannick Carrasco for \u00a325m are wide of the mark, says Unai Emery. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay for anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot sign anyone permanently. We can only sign loan players.\u201d Emery also gave gnomic updates on a couple of persistent rumours, concerning the Sevilla midfielder Ever Banega (\u201cI know this player and he is a very good player. I cannot tell you more.\u201d) and Barcelona\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez (\u201cI know the club is working on possibilities of which players help us with big performances like we need now.\u201d).\nWatford have approached Lyon to discuss a potential move for the 22-year-old French winger Maxwel Cornet, author of three Champions League goals against Manchester City this season but with just one league start to his name, having been \u201calerted to his availability\u201d, according to the Independent. He would cost, according to the Sun, around \u00a320m and is also being pursued by Milan.\nAlso linked with a move from France to the Premier League this morning is Emiliano Sala, whose \u00a318m switch to Cardiff could be back on \u201cafter the Argentinian intimated he would be keen to join\u201d, says the Mail.

All three clubs would hope to sign him on a similarly temporary arrangement, and the Mail adds West Ham and Galatasaray to the mix for good measure. Leicester have rejected an offer from Huddersfield for Shinji Okazaki. QPR want \u00a310m for the midfielder Eberechi Eze, with Bournemouth, Brighton and Crystal Palace interested. Everton are preparing a \u00a315m bid for Southampton\u2019s Portuguese full-back Cedric.\nJosh Bohui, a 19-year-old forward who has shown such promise in the Manchester United youth system that, according to the Mirror, he \u201chas been dubbed the new Andy Cole\u201d, might leave when his contract expires in the summer, with Barcelona and Monaco showing interest.",

Andrew Luck, the comeback player of the year, is quite capable of keeping pace.\nWhat the Chiefs need to do to win: Their defense needs to step up. The Chiefs had the second-worst passing defense in the league over the regular season, which could be quite a problem against Indianapolis, who have won 10 of their last 11 games.\nKey player: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs. In his first full year as a starting quarterback, Mahomes had a season for the ages, hitting marks that only the likes of Tom Brady and Peyton Manning have reached. Now we get to see how he fares in his first playoff game.\nPrediction: Colts 28-31 Chiefs\nWhat the Cowboys need to do to win: Pretend it\u2019s a home game. The Cowboys have lost their last seven road games in the playoffs. The good news? It\u2019s not going to be difficult for them to imagine they\u2019re playing in front of a friendly crowd. The Rams have yet to fully capture LA\u2019s imagination since their move from St Louis and Cowboys fans, notoriously, travel well. There\u2019s a good chance that the crowd\u2019s loyalties will be evenly split.\nWhat the Rams need to do to win: Jared Goff has to return to form. The Rams QB had a fantastic start to the season, and his success translated to team success, but he came down to earth later in the season, throwing a career-high four picks in an early December game against the Chicago Bears, and struggling against the Philadelphia Eagles. He won\u2019t be able to afford many mistakes on Saturday.\nKey player: Todd Gurley, RB, Los Angeles Rams. One of the best running backs in the league, Gurley is still recovering from a knee injury. The Rams expect to balance both him and CJ Anderson during their matchup against Dallas, but if Gurley has recovered, expect him to make a game-changing play or two.\nPrediction: Cowboys 28-21 Rams\nWhat the Chargers need to do to win: Get to the quarterback. While he ended the season with one of his finest efforts of the season, Tom Brady has looked human of late and more vulnerable to pressure. Meanwhile, the Chargers may have the best all-around defense of the teams remaining in the playoffs.\nWhat the Patriots need to do to win: Keep doing what they\u2019re doing at home. The Patriots have a perfect 8-0 record at Gillette Stadium this season and no team will have benefitted more from the bye week, what with Brady showing some surprising signs of age. Oh, and Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has never won a game against Brady.\nKey player: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots. The Patriots\u2019 playoff success has depended on the health of Gronkowski, maybe the greatest tight end in NFL history. Expect Brady to look for him when his team need to pick up big-time yardage, even though Gronkowski has not had a vintage season by his standards.\nPrediction: Chargers 28-31 Patriots\nWhat the Eagles need to do to win: Once again rely on Nick Foles\u2019s magic. When the Bears\u2019 Cody Parkey clanged the ball off the uprights twice last Sunday, it became tough to deny the fates.\nWhat the Saints need to do to win: Take an early lead. How do you protect yourself from a last-minute collapse like the one suffered by the Chicago Bears on Sunday? You throw a few unanswered touchdowns early and give your solid defense a chance to hold the line. Drew Brees can do just that.\nKey player: Cam Jordan, DE, Saints. Jordan is arguably the Saints\u2019 best defensive player, certainly their most reliable one in terms of staying on the field. He leads the team in sacks and getting to the quarterback could be a major deal this week.\nPrediction: Eagles 17-31 Saints",

More than 5,000 police will be stationed in the capital and all local officers have been called back from leave.\nThere could also be large protests in the small town of Bourges in central France after gilets jaunes groups online suggested its central location made it easy to reach and that it had less of a police presence.\nThe town of 66,000 people \u2013 fearing clashes and violence \u2013 has closed museums, cleared building sites, removed parking meters and covered up electronic signs at bus stops. The local police chief on Friday banned any demonstration in Bourges historic centre, meaning protestors would have to keep to boulevards on the edge of the town.\nMany shop owners in the town said they could not afford to shut their businesses on the first Saturday of the January sales and would stay open until the last minute, closing only if there was a security risk \u2013 but fearing the majority of customers would stay away.\nGilets jaunes demonstrators have continued to barricade roundabouts across France. The government said about 60% of speed cameras across France had been damaged or destroyed since the start of the protest movement in November. Officials said the speed cameras that do remain in use had shown more drivers breaking speed limits, presumably thinking they would not be caught.\nAlthough the gilets jaunes protests \u2013 named after the yellow hi-vis jackets worn by demonstrators \u2013 began in November as a revolt against fuel tax, local politicians said fury over this summer\u2019s move to cut speeds to 80km per hour (50mph) on many secondary roads had played an important roll in mobilising protests in the countryside.\n\u201cPeople are still complaining about it in the regions,\u201d Christophe Jerretie, an MP for Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche party in Corr\u00e8ze, said of the speed limits. Some protesters want the speed limit changes scrapped but the government believes the measure, which will be evaluated fully next year, has already saved hundreds of lives.\nThe nationwide \u201cgreat national debate\u201d, which the president suggested in December as a solution to gilets jaunes\u2019 complaints that citizens do not have enough say in policy, will launch on Tuesday. But it would be an unprecedented exercise that has proved complex to organise.\nThe head of France\u2019s national debates commission, Chantal Jouanno, withdrew her participation in Macron\u2019s debate this week amid outrage over her \u20ac14,666 monthly salary, leaving the government scrabbling to reorganise proceedings.\nQuestions remained over whether the debate process would be focused on town-hall meetings and whether the government would take into account what was said.\nThe topics to be discussed included the tax system, reform of state institutions as well as democracy and citizenship. Fears have been raised that groups such as the powerful lobby against same-sex marriage would use the debate to reopen discussion on society issues. But the government said topics such as same-sex marriage, which came into force in France in 2013 amid massive street protests, would not be up for discussion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question to roll back on abortion, the death penalty or equal marriage,\u201d the government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.\nMacron and his party want to hark back to the big door-to-door consultation on the nation\u2019s problems that he set up before his presidential bid in 2017. But an Odoxa poll found seven out of 10 French people did not think the debate, which begins next week, would be useful for the country.\nIn the meantime, the government has focused on law and order measures in response to violence at gilets jaunes protests as a way to try to win back support for the centrist, pro-business Macron, particularly among voters on the centre-right.\nThe prime minister has promised new laws, including setting up a register of rioters, similar to that used to deter football hooligans, to force them to report to police and prevent them from joining demonstrations.\nHuman rights lawyers have said some of the proposals could go against the French constitutional right to protest. But the government has been convinced that showing \u201cauthority\u201d was crucial to win support back to Macron before European elections.\nTwo recent polls have shown approval ratings for Macron and the prime minister rising again after a period of decline \u2013 although approval ratings for the president remained beneath the symbolically low level of 30%.\nA counter protest against the gilets jaunes demonstrators has been scheduled for 27 January in Paris.\nAnnual Cevipof polling released in Le Figaro on Friday showed what the political scientist Bruno Cautr\u00e8s called the highest level of \u201cmistrust and anger\u201d at French politicians and state institutions in 10 years of polling.",

Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story will feature new on-camera interviews with the legendary songwriter.\nThe streaming platform says the film \u201ccaptures the troubled spirit of America in 1975 and the joyous music that Dylan performed during the fall of that year.\u201d It is due later this year.\nVariety reports that the film will be less straightforward than Scorsese\u2019s 2005 Dylan documentary, No Direction Home, which focused on the songwriter\u2019s rise to fame, his move to New York and temporary retirement following a motorcycle accident in July 1966. \u201cScorsese provides the master vision,\u201d wrote critic Roger Ebert on that film\u2019s release, \u201cand his factual footage unfolds with the narrative power of fiction.\u201d\nThe Rolling Thunder Revue was a freewheeling multi-artist caravan that began in October 1975 and concluded in May 1976. Artists including Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Mick Ronson, Bette Midler, Roger McGuinn, Emmylou Harris and Allen Ginsberg joined Dylan on the autumn leg of the tour, which is said to be the focus of Scorsese\u2019s film. Dylan\u2019s mother also appeared. Dylan frequently performed in white face paint.\nIt is one of the most noteworthy tours in rock history: \u201cThe Rolling Thunder Revue shows remain some of the finest music Dylan ever made with a live band,\u201d wrote critic Clinton Heylin in his 1991 Dylan biography Behind the Shades. In 2002, an official recording of the tour was released in Dylan\u2019s Bootleg Series.\nDylan engaged Sam Shepard as a screenwriter for a film about the tour, although the result was largely improvised. Released in 1978, Renaldo and Clara featured live footage, interviews and dramatised fictional portions about Dylan\u2019s life. He was billed as Renaldo and his first wife, Sara Dylan, as Clara. It clocked in at almost four hours and was panned by critics.\nScorsese\u2019s film is not the only Dylan feature in the works. Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino has said he is directing a film based on Dylan\u2019s 1975 album Blood on the Tracks, to be written by The Fisher King and The Bridges of Madison County screenwriter Richard LaGravenese.\nDylan will perform a rare UK concert this summer, sharing the bill with Neil Young at London\u2019s Hyde Park on 12 July. Scorsese\u2019s next slated feature film is another Netflix production, The Irishman, about the mafia-union wars of the 70s.",

In 2018, 36% of Catholics said they had been to church in the past seven days, a small drop from the 39% average between 2014 and 2017, but a dramatic shift since 1975 when 75% reported weekly attendance.\nHowever, the proportion of Catholics among the US population has remained relatively stable. Overall, 22% of Americans identified as Catholic in 2018, compared with an average of 25% over the past 70 years. More than half - 52% - said religion was very important in their lives.\nGallup said: \u201cGiven the sheer breadth of the alleged and confirmed sexual abuse, the erosion of Catholics\u2019 views of the clergy\u2019s ethical standards is perhaps to be expected. The church\u2019s handling of many of these cases undoubtedly weighs heavily on Catholics\u2019 minds and likely plays a part in shaping their more increasingly negative views of the church and organised religion as a whole.\u201d\nPope Francis has ordered bishops from around the world to the Vatican next month for an unprecedented summit to discuss the sexual abuse crisis. He has been criticised for failing to take decisive action in the face of scandals in many countries.\n This article was amended on 12 January 2019. The original headline wrongly stated that a third of US Catholics think priests are not honest or ethical.",

        "content": "Womenswear retailer blames discounting for second profit downgrade in three months\nQuiz has issued its second profit warning in just over three months, as the womenswear retailer\u2019s woes continue following a weaker than expected Christmas.\nThe company said heavy discounting meant its main measure of profits for the 2019 financial year would be \u00a38.2m, 29% lower than the \u00a311.5m it expected when it cut its forecasts in October.\nRevenues for the full year to 31 March 2019 will be also be lower than current market expectations, at \u00a3133m, down from forecasts of \u00a3138m, Quiz said.\nShares slumped by more than 24% on Friday to 27p. The share price has now fallen by more than 80% since July, when it hit a high of 205p.\nQuiz\u2019s profit downgrade comes amid a challenging time for the British retail industry, which is struggling with weaker demand from consumers, prompted in part by Brexit uncertainty, as well as rising costs and intense competition.\nRetailers in 2018 endured their worst Christmas since the financial crisis, with British Retail Consortium figures showing that total sales growth dropped to zero in December for the first time since 2008, with all areas of the high street hit by a fall in sales except food.\nQuiz raised more than \u00a3100m when it listed in July 2017 \u2013 giving \u00a392.1m to its shareholders \u2013 but has since struggled to grow sales fast enough.\nThe retailer said its total revenue increased by 8.4% in the six weeks to 5 January, with online sales up by 34.1%. However, it significantly increased its staff and marketing costs in recent months, weighing on profits.\nTarak Ramzan, Quiz\u2019s chief executive, said the company had faced a \u201cbackdrop of challenging trading conditions over recent months\u201d.\nRamzan said: \u201cQuiz has delivered further revenue growth over the Christmas period driven by the performance of our own websites. However, the growth and the margin achieved have been below our initial expectations and, consequently, the board considers it appropriate to revise its sales and profit expectations for the current year.\nRamzan, the founder of Quiz in the early 1990s, added he was \u201cconfident about Quiz\u2019s long-term potential\u201d.",

        "content": "In the hit video game, a birder finds joy and despair in a realistic portrayal of wildlife in the pre-conservation era\nThe first time I see ravens, I flush them out of an alpine meadow carpeted with wildflowers. I pause to watch the flock fly off towards the distant, snow-capped peaks, trailed by their echoing croaks, when a man riding by on horseback bumps into me.\nIrritated, I shoot the man dead, and take his hat. So it goes in Red Dead Redemption 2.\nAvailable since October, the video game is set in an imagined version of the American west in the year 1899. It\u2019s a huge release, one of the bestselling video games of 2018 and one that sits at or near the top of many of the internet\u2019s best of 2018 video game lists. It\u2019s also unique in that the natural world \u2013 or, at least, a romanticized and heightened version of it \u2013 is one of the main characters.\nYou play as the outlaw Arthur Morgan and can choose to spend your time marauding across the landscape, holding up wagons and evading lawmen \u2013 or you can play a gentler way, as a birder. Of sorts. Birding as a hobby was just getting under way in the late 1800s, and much of the population, especially those living off the land as Arthur Morgan does, still primarily viewed birds as resources for food, materials and hunting sport. The nation\u2019s landmark law protecting migratory birds was still two decades away.\nThe gigantic RDR2 playable map is brimming with life. Hawks perch on exposed branches and ducks flush from riverbanks. Wolves chase deer through the woods, and vultures descend to feed on the carcasses. There are alligators, turtles, snakes, frogs, toads, bats and dozens of species of fish. In all there are about 200 distinct, interactive species of animals in RDR2, and more than 40 plant species.\nI spent most of my time finding birds, and was impressed with the breadth and relative accuracy of the species represented. Birds change with habitat: roseate spoonbills and great egrets feed in the bayous of Saint Denis. Laughing gulls and red-footed boobies roost along the coast, while eagles and condors soar over mountain peaks. Each of these are crafted with accurate field marks and habits. There are dozens of species I couldn\u2019t even find, including Carolina parakeets, ferruginous hawks, and pileated woodpeckers. As in real-life birding, you\u2019re never guaranteed to see anything.\nThe sound design, too, is impressive. The landscape is alive with birdsong, including many species not actually in the game, such as the northern flicker and ruby-crowned kinglet. I was riding through a wooded area one time as dusk turned to night, and whippoorwills began singing out all around me.\nThose kinds of natural surprises are what I love most about the game, and they happen frequently. One time I shot a mallard and left its body on the lakeshore after taking its feathers and meat. I was nearby about 10 minutes later and noticed a red fox emerging from the grass and walking down towards the duck carcass, still on the shore. A pair of turkey vultures descended and the trio fed on the duck. I watched from afar through my binoculars (in-game binoculars!) and felt incredibly lucky to have caught such a spontaneous and real-feeling episode.\nThere are some minor errors I noticed, however, that as a birder and critic of these things I feel obligated to point out. In addition to the snowy egret, there are quite a few little egrets in Saint Denis, which would have been a truly rare North America sighting. What\u2019s called a California quail is actually a northern bobwhite. Tanagers are, for some reason, referred to as scarlet tanager songbird and western tanager songbird. But that\u2019s all. Overall, RDR2 is absolutely the best and boldest representation of American birdlife in any video game. The competition is not even close.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game for birders. This game exists in a time when humans mainly viewed birds \u2013 and all of the natural world \u2013 as ripe for exploitation rather than appreciation. All animals in the game can be hunted and either eaten or crafted into clothing or materials. Feathers are used to craft arrows that fly straighter. Special feathers, like those from hawks and eagles, are used to make clothing. All of these parts can be traded or sold.\nOf course, unregulated hunting was a very real threat to birds at the time. The demand for egret plumes for fancy hats was driving several species toward extinction. (Snowy egret plumes can be sold in-game for $2.50 apiece.) Habitat loss and overhunting contributed to the extinction of the Carolina parakeet soon after the game\u2019s timeframe, in the early 20th century. (Carolina parakeet flight feathers can be used to make far-flying arrows in the game.)\nThe type of wanton destruction encouraged in Red Dead Redemption 2 is what led the National Audubon Society to lobby for, and Congress to pass, the real Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918, and other environmental legislation in the following decades. But in the game, the player must kill to progress.\nThankfully, the game does not shy away from the realities of these interactions. An imprecise shot will wound an animal, leaving it to yelp and squirm before you finish your job. In order to receive meat or parts, you need to skin or pluck the animal, a process that, though superficial, is clearly and gruesomely animated. Nor does RDR2 spare you the experience of the human impact on the land.\nIn fact, the disastrous intersection between humans and the environment is the game\u2019s major theme. A sense of foreboding followed me around the lush world, knowledge that humans were at work destroying it all. Much of that destruction is represented in-game, from the factory smokestacks of Saint Denis to the Owanjila dam, but I could also feel it extending into real life. I couldn\u2019t help but envision the dirt paths becoming busy highways, and each green meadow converted into a housing development. RDR2 presents an idealized version of the natural world, but the loss feels very real.\nThe trouble is, as a birder, it\u2019s not a lesson I needed to learn. I know full well about the continued decline of bird populations, habitat loss and environmental degradation. That the game could elicit such deep feelings of sadness and regret is to its credit, but I was often left feeling hopeless and wanting to get outside to enjoy real nature while I still could. My mom always used to tell me to stop playing video games and go outside, but this is the first game that made me want to.\nEach of these birds is a distinct species in the game.

His death means there have been an average of more than two murders a day in Puerto Rico so far this year.\nHis manager, Eduardo Rodriguez, said Fret was an \u201cartistic soul\u201d and a \u201cbig-hearted dreamer\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are no words that describe the feeling we have and the pain that causes us to know that a person with so many dreams has to go. We must all unite in these difficult times, and ask for much peace for our beloved Puerto Rico \u2026 He still had a lot left to do.\u201d\nFret broke through in 2018 with his debut single Soy Asi, which shares the Latin trap sound with other flamboyant Puerto Rican stars such as Bad Bunny and Ozuna. Fret, however, was openly gay, a rarity in the scene. \u201cI\u2019m going to act like I don\u2019t give a damn about what anybody has to say, with my blonde hair, my black nails, showing my stomach, glittery from head to toe,\u201d he told Paper magazine last year. \u201cYoung gay guys or young lesbians \u2026 are looking at me now like a role model, like wow, if he did it, and he don\u2019t care what anybody else has to say, I can do it.\u201d\nIn June 2018, Fret was charged with aggravated battery in Miami, after he threw a metal bottle at a man he claimed was being homophobic towards him.\nHis death comes in a week when an FBI official, Douglas Leff, described a \u201ccrisis of violence\u201d in Puerto Rico, and its congress member Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez requested increased law enforcement from US Homeland Security \u2013 Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the US \u2013 to address a \u201csense of impunity and lawfulness\u201d there. Gang activity, along with drug and human trafficking, is being blamed for the levels of violent crime, compounded by \u201chigh levels of absenteeism\u201d in the Puerto Rico\u2019s police force, according to Gonz\u00e1lez.",

        "content": "Perhaps Billy Sharp\u2019s best quality, aside from his ability inside the 18-yard box, is that he does not take himself too seriously. Long before and long after he unveiled an undershirt with the words \u201cfat lad from Sheffield\u201d in 2010 \u2013 poking fun at how Sean O\u2019Driscoll, his then manager, said Sharp could be portrayed when off-colour \u2013 the striker has scored goals for fun.\nOn New Year\u2019s Day he netted his 220th league goal in 496 matches; no one has scored more in league football this century. In all competitions, he is on 232, fast approaching another milestone. \u201cI\u2019d like to get to 250,\u201d Sharp says.\nThose who have coached and played alongside the striker, from his first taste of first-team football as a teenager at Rushden & Diamonds to Scunthorpe and Southampton, have the utmost respect for him. Everybody says the same thing: that he simply loves putting the ball in the net. That is especially true at his hometown club Sheffield United, where the 32-year-old, in his third spell, also enjoys wearing the captain\u2019s armband.\nThis season he is determined to hoist Chris Wilder\u2019s side into the Premier League. United host Queen Park Rangers on Saturday in search of a fourth successive league win. \u201cEvery goal means a lot to me,\u201d he says. \u201cScoring for Sheffield United is extra special because it\u2019s the club I supported as a boy. I\u2019m part of a successful team at the minute, which we hope to continue until the end of the season.\u201d\nIt is nine years since Sharp joined Doncaster Rovers, where he quickly struck up a fine partnership with the winger James Coppinger. The pair roomed on trips too, at Doncaster, and, later, Nottingham Forest. \u201cI played with Alan Shearer at Newcastle and the best strikers are so clinical in front of goal \u2013 they pride themselves on getting and taking opportunities,\u201d Coppinger says. \u201cBilly would be doing diving headers the night before a game in the hotel room and joking about how he is going to score. I think he just loves scoring goals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable when you are that passionate and focused that it\u2019s going to happen and Alan Shearer was the same. Every time he goes on the pitch, Billy\u2019s disappointed if he doesn\u2019t score. Sometimes he can be hardly in the game but then he will pop up with a goal. I think that\u2019s the sign of a great striker. It\u2019s a knack, a love for being in the right place at the right time.\u201d\nA return to Sheffield in 2015 helped the Sharp family settle, following the tragic loss of a son, Luey, four years earlier. As a player, the consensus is that Sharp has matured with age, though even as an 18-year-old, loaned from the Blades to League Two Rushden, his goalscoring instinct was clear, with nine goals in 16 appearances. He got his first hat-trick in April 2005, in a 4-2 win against Boston; Drewe Broughton opened the scoring that day.\n\u201cHe single-handedly kept us in the Football League, which was worth jobs and everything else to people,\u201d Broughton says. \u201cAnd then he signed for Scunthorpe and they came in for me as well, because Brian Laws wanted to replicate that partnership. It was an old-fashioned partnership but it worked. I think he won the players\u2019 player award at the end of the season.\n\u201cBarry Hunter was manager, who is now chief scout at Liverpool. It was Baz\u2019s first managerial job and I was our No 9, a 10-goal-a-season target man, and we were dying for goals. He came in and it was just blatantly obvious. You could see that abundant ability he has: ruthlessness, that self-worth and self-belief. Centre-halves didn\u2019t bully him and, technically, he was a brilliant finisher.\n\u201cHe is a thickset boy but he was in great nick and he still is today. He is in great shape, very athletic and short and strong. It was my job to bring the ball down on my chest or flick on headers for him and I remember that game against Boston. It was bang, touch, and finish. I think he scored two of those. Literally, bang, bang. Yes, a really good finisher. He was prolific even then.\u201d\nAndy Crosby was captain at Scunthorpe when Sharp arrived in the summer of 2005 and has worked with him on several occasions since, taking him back to Bramall Lane with Nigel Adkins. Sharp had earlier helped Southampton to promotion to the Premier League under Adkins and Crosby, who also brought him on loan to Reading in 2013.\n\u201cI have nothing but praise for him on and off the pitch,\u201d says Crosby, now the assistant to Adkins at Hull. \u201cI think he\u2019ll carry on until there\u2019s really no more left inside him. He\u2019s never been incredibly quick but he has a great brain, he just knows where the ball is going to drop. I can still see Billy playing on a Sunday morning when he is 55, celebrating goals as he does now.\u201d",

        "content": "Research shows 10% of these searches involve violent phrases such as \u2018Jews must die\u2019\nAt least 170,000 antisemitic Google searches are made in the UK every year, with 10% of them involving violent phrases such as \u201cJews must die\u201d or \u201ckill Jews\u201d, research has revealed.\nThe analysis for the Community Security Trust (CST) showed that while most of the searches are for jokes mocking Jewish people, the most common negative stereotypes claim Jews are \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d.\nIn the 12 months after Google amended its autocomplete function to stop the word \u201cevil\u201d appearing after someone typed \u201care Jews\u201d, there was a 10% decline in the number of these searches, the research found.\nThe findings cover a 14-year period starting in 2004 and are based on analysis of Google data, as well as material from the archive of the far-right website Stormfront, one of the oldest and largest neo-Nazi websites.\nThe study, commissioned jointly by the CST and the Antisemitism Policy Trust, set out the most common abusive searches, where they are most popular and at what time of the day, and how trends have changed over time. The report found:\n17,000 antisemitic searches on Google every year have violent connotations. These searches tend to spike between 2am and 3am.\nAntisemitic searches are higher in Wales than in any other part of the UK by proportion of the population, and lowest in Scotland.\nAntisemitic searches are just as high in cities that mostly vote Labour as they are in cities that mostly vote Conservative.\nSomeone searching for jokes about Jews is 100 times more likely to search for jokes about black people, using the N-word.\nThe number of antisemitic searches rose sharply in the days following Israel\u2019s Eurovision song contest victory last year, and went up 79% in April 2018, when Labour was embroiled in a row over antisemitism.\nThe research also pointed to an enduring fascination with conspiracy theories about the role of the Rothschild banking family in \u201crunning the world\u201d.\nThe report said there are more Google searches in the UK every year related to the Rothschilds than for Jewish celebrities such David Baddiel or Tracy Ann Oberman.\nSearches related to the Rothschilds have risen by 39% in the past three years, the research showed.\nThough the report acknowledged \u201cit is impossible to know for sure that any given search is made by a person with antisemitic attitudes\u201d, it said people tend to be far more open when they search for something online, revealing prejudices, hatreds and interests they might otherwise have kept hidden.\nSeth Stephens-Davidowitz, the author of the report \u2013 titled Hidden hate: what Google searches tell us about antisemitism today \u2013 said: \u201cWe have found that searches looking for information on the Holocaust being a hoax rise about 30% every year on Holocaust Memorial Day.\n\u201cWe learned that Jewish women in public life or positions of power are the subject of more antisemitism searches than Jewish men in similar positions.\n\u201cWe found evidence of the rise in popularity of antisemitic conspiracy theories \u2026 and we found that sometimes heightened media focus on Jews or Israel, even if it is positive, can still lead to an increase in online searches for antisemitic content.\u201d\nThough the report welcomed Google\u2019s change in 2016 to the autocomplete formula, it said prior to doing so, the search engine was effectively \u201cdirecting people to make antisemitic searches who might otherwise not have done so\u201d.\nDr Dave Rich, the head of policy at the CST, said: \u201cSearch engines and internet companies have a responsibility to ensure that people asking these questions are directed away from hateful content and towards material that might challenge their prejudices.\u201d\nGoogle said it \u201cdoes its best to prevent inappropriate predictions\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cWe partner with organisations in the UK who work to tackle hate speech, including CST and Stop Hate UK. Autocomplete helps you get to the information you are looking for as quickly as possible. For certain issues, including hateful predictions against groups and individuals based on religion, we have developed policies to exclude such terms.\u201d",

        "content": "His last novel Capital skewered the property bubble, now his latest The Wall imagines Britain barricaded after environmental catastrophe. Lanchester talks about refugees, Brexit \u2013 and optimism\nDesperate refugees risking their lives crossing the Channel in small boats in the dead of night; extreme temperatures forcing people to flee their homes; politicians inciting a fear of others, and railing against traitors who \u201cwant us to be overrun, to be washed away\u201d. These are not recent news stories, but a glimpse of a possible era after climate catastrophe, or the \u201cChange\u201d as it is known in one of the first big novels of the year, John Lanchester\u2019s The Wall. Lanchester imagines a moment in the future when rising sea levels mean there isn\u2019t a single beach left on the planet, those countries that remain habitable have become fortresses and the young feel bitterly betrayed by the previous generation because of the destroyed world they have inherited. We are barely into 2019 and the future already seems terrifyingly bleak.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t crack my knuckles and sit down to write a novel about now. I was halfway through another novel. I still am,\u201d Lanchester explains, almost apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s not the future, but it\u2019s a version of a future, and it feels a lot like a version of the future that we are heading for.\u201d\nWith the emphasis on borders, fear of invasion and lines such as: \u201cThis country is the best in the world\u201d, and, of course, the wall itself \u2013 \u201ca long, low concrete monster\u201d \u2013 it is hard not to read the novel as a riff on Brexit and the US under Trump, as well as a chilling ecological dystopia. Post-2016, a wall is surely shorthand for ugly political and ideological division (as with the grisly punishment wall in Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, written in Berlin in 1984). \u201cOne of the things about the wall in the book is that it is not a metaphor for anything else,\u201d the author insists. \u201cWe had this period when walls were coming down around the world and now, just as an empirical fact, they are springing up all over the place.\u201d And he hasn\u2019t been following Brexit obsessively \u2013 \u201ca gigantic waste of emotional energy. Danny Dyer seems like a deathless genius of political science for asking: \u2018What is it?\u2019\u201d\nLanchester is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated essayists, with a canny journalistic instinct as a novelist, from his award-winning 1996 debut The Debt to Pleasure, a balsamic-black foodie satire written at a moment of peak gastro-porn during a stint as the Observer\u2019s restaurant critic, to his last novel Capital, a Dickensian saga of the London property bubble, published in 2012. He distinguishes his non-fiction and fiction in terms of subjects that interest him, \u201cthings happening in the world\u201d and \u201cthe things that won\u2019t leave you alone\u201d. For novels, he says: \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of psychic charge, there\u2019s something unresolved, that\u2019s why the images keep coming back.\u201d And for this, his fifth, the image was of a person standing guard on a wall. It initially came to him in the form of a recurring dream. The author tells himself \u201csort of half-conscious\u201d stories to help get to sleep: \u201cIt works, by the way, I sleep really well.\u201d The dream first began in 2016 \u201cand it wouldn\u2019t quite go away. Then I started thinking about who the person was and what the world was. It didn\u2019t exactly write itself but it came much more quickly than my other books,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was much more than a metaphor. It was an image, a country with a wall round it.\u201d\nThe son of a South African-born banker and an Irish mother (the troubling story of his parents\u2019 marriage is affectingly recounted in Family Romance, 2007), Lanchester describes himself as \u201ca well-disguised semi-immigrant\u201d; he was born in Germany in 1962; had lived in seven different countries by the time he was four; and spent much of his childhood in Hong Kong (the inspiration for his 2002 novel Fragrant Harbour). For him, the image of the wall is a \u201ccomforting\u201d rather than a disturbing one. Growing up, he was very aware that \u201cHong Kong was safe and that just over the border there was a place where people were desperate to escape from, and that people died trying to get over the border, people drowned swimming. There was a street called Boundary Street, and if you got to Boundary Street you could stay, you weren\u2019t repatriated. For a child\u2019s imagination there was something very vivid about that, and the thing which stuck with me is that you are in the place that is safe.\u201d For this reason, he struggles to understand fears over immigration, of \u201cbeing swamped or overrun or threatened in some way. If people want to get to the place where you are, that means you are in a safe place.\u201d\nWitty and softly spoken, he has been described as resembling \u201can off-duty bank manager\u201d, partly because he is unafraid of nerdy subjects (only Lanchester could make the Vix Index of market volatility interesting, as he did in How to Speak Money) so that there are few genres he hasn\u2019t tackled. \u201cYou make me sound like Meryl Streep: \u2018She does Polish, she does Jewish, she does Wasp, she does funny!\u2019\u201d he grumbles.\nAlthough he seems too rooted in the here and now, too interested in the intricacies of systems from the London tube to the FTSE, to contemplate science fiction, it should be no surprise that he has now taken on the most urgent issue of our times in this slim yet devastating work of speculative fiction. He chafes slightly at the label, recalling JG Ballard asking him not to mention SF in an interview he was writing, \u201cbecause he felt you automatically lose half the readers\u201d. While that has undoubtedly changed, he argues that, as a subject, global warming is already scientific fact. If any novelist is going to make real the nightmare scenarios we are storing up, it is Lanchester. He began Capital in 2006, after all. \u201cAny fool could see that there was a crash coming,\u201d he says now. Is there going to be another recession? \u201cYes, I\u2019d have thought so, but heaven only knows what form it will take.\u201d\nQuoting the German economist Rudi Dornbusch in a Guardian piece on the TV adaptation of Capital in 2015, Lanchester wrote: \u201cIn economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could.\u201d Substitute the environment for economics and the consequences are catastrophic.\n\u201cI think, unfortunately, that is the way that change happens,\u201d Lanchester says. \u201cThere\u2019s a bitter truth in Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises. \u2018How did you go broke?\u2019 \u2018Two ways. Gradually then suddenly.\u2019 Lots of things happen like that.\u201d\nHe is deliberately opaque about the timeframe in which The Wall is set: \u201cThere are all sorts of feedback effects of climate, which means we don\u2019t know how fast it is going to happen.\u201d Researching an essay for the London Review of Books back in 2007 (which begins by anticipating the radical civil disobedience of groups such as Extinction Rebellion), he was haunted by the idea of \u201cclimate departure\u201d\u2013 a point in the future when the coldest average day \u201cis warmer than the warmest average day in the past\u201d, he summarises. As he says, it\u2019s best not to think about it too hard. But the powerful \u201cpsychological resistance\u201d and \u201cdenial\u201d that he identified as characterising our response to climate change are an indulgence no longer available to us, as the extreme weather, not to mention the dire warnings of the IPCC report, last year made clear.\nHe has two children, now 20 and 16, with his wife the writer Miranda Carter, and is acutely aware of the legacy we are leaving behind. \u201cIt will be wonderful for it not to be the thing that fundamentally alters the texture of human existence, but the evidence doesn\u2019t suggest that,\u201d he says. \u201cJust ask a gardener. I was talking to a wine person about English grapes. Part of the reason we have all this sparkling wine now is that 30 years ago they were harvesting champagne in mid-to-late October, now it\u2019s in August. That\u2019s not a metaphor for anything.\u201d\nIt is a commonplace that all dystopias are versions of the present, and Lanchester quotes William Gibson\u2019s famous line: \u201cThe future is already here \u2013 it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u201d In the novel, a young \u201cDefender\u201d reflects on the old world: \u201cThe produce you could get before the Change,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything, all the time. Tomatoes and fruits, hams from you name it, meat whenever you liked it, all of it all the year around \u2026 it\u2019s like science fiction, where they have a machine that just makes stuff \u2026 Where does it all end? I mean, the idea is amazing ... and yet it\u2019s weird and it\u2019s wrong too.\u201d\nLanchester came of age in the early 1980s, when \u201cthings were pretty grim\u201d. \u201cPeople have always been frightened about the end of the world \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of who we are,\u201d he says, recalling how as a teenager the threat of nuclear war created similar feelings of individual impotence and impending doom. But what makes the current moment \u201cparticularly desperate\u201d, he believes, \u201cis the absence of a will to do anything about it \u2026 Trump gives a sort of autonomy for the forces that are actively lying.\u201d\nAlong with our capacity for \u201cselective amnesia\u201d, as a species \u201cwe have an amazing talent for being oblivious, we are really, really good at it,\u201d he marvels. \u201cMaybe \u2026 how unbearable it is if you are not. Because the alternative is back on the smartphones and the constant firehose of bad news. I\u2019m not sure we innately have the tools to deal with that. We haven\u2019t worked out what to do about these,\u201d he says picking up my mobile as if it had just dropped from space.\nThe novel\u2019s blockbuster ending is appropriately uncertain. Is there any room for hope? As he says, climate change is a story in which we deeply don\u2019t want to believe. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he replies, rather crushingly. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a Live Aid style reunification concert five years later.\u201d\nHow do you follow a novel about the destruction of the planet as we know it? \u201cIf history shows us anything, it\u2019s a school for wizards, or a novel about bunny rabbits or something.\u201d\nWhile a Hogwarts for rabbits seems unlikely, his next novel is bound to be something completely different. He likes to use a metaphor of a hall with a series of rooms off it to describe the writing process: \u201cYou know there\u2019s something in that room, you are attracted by it but frightened at the same time. You stay in the room for as long as it takes to write it, it\u2019s a day-in, day-out thing. And then at the end of it, that door\u2019s opened out. Why would you go back?\u201d\nHe has a strict word count per day: 500 for fiction, 1,000 for non-fiction and 1,500 for journalism. And he never fails to hit it. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he quavers in his best Alan Bennett impression, \u201cyou feel ill if you don\u2019t!\u201d (as Bennett once told him when asked how he did it). \u201cIt\u2019s true. Then what are you for? That\u2019s your job.\u201d (Although, reassuringly, he \u201cnot infrequently\u201d goes back to bed of a morning, following Hilary Mantel\u2019s advice that it\u2019s crucial to get enough sleep before writing. \u201cIf I start the day too early, I can\u2019t.\u201d) And when he finally clocks off, he\u2019s a big fan of the TV box set: writers can only hope their novels are \u201cas well written as very good telly\u201d, he says.\nHe plans to return to the novel abandoned before The Wall, \u201cbut it\u2019s been putting up quite a good fight\u201d. He also wants to complete a collection of short stories, having recently had one, the first he has written, published in the New Yorker. \u201cSeriously! I don\u2019t want to boast but I was very proud of that,\u201d he admits endearingly. \u201cThere are not many things that happen in your mid 50s that give you a genuine rush.\u201d\nFor the immediate future, he hopes 2019 \u201cis easier on all of us than the last couple of years\u201d. And in the long term? \u201cMy main ambition, my main hope for the book, is that I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\n The Wall is published by Faber on 17 January.

        "content": "These vegan recipes use chickpea water in place of eggs, perfect for baking or pancake making\nThanks to Bake Off, aquafaba has hit the mainstream. It\u2019s an ingredient I rely on when baking for vegans. Aquafaba (Italian for \u201cbean water\u201d) is the liquid left over from cooking legumes and pulses, most often chickpeas. When whipped, it magically transforms into a meringue-like consistency. It can be used in place of eggs for anything from a scone to a Victoria sponge. It also makes logic-defying meringues and amazing mayonnaise.\nThese are a revelation: egg-free meringues that have a perfect texture and chew. Ideally this would be done in a stand mixer (because they\u2019re the most powerful), but an electric hand whisk will do. This recipe will work with any fruit and dairy-free cream, yoghurt or creme fraiche.\nPrep 30 min\n Cook 2 hr\n Cool 2 hr\n Makes 10\u201312 large meringues\nFlavourless oil (such as groundnut)1 x 400g tin chickpeasSalt150g golden caster sugar1 \u00bd tsp cream of tartarSeeds from 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla paste\nFor the caramel and citrus2 tangerines, mandarins or satsumas1 yellow grapefruit100g caster sugarWhipped coconut cream mixed with vanilla paste, to serve\nHeat the oven to 110C (90C fan)/230F/gas \u00bc. Line two baking trays with nonstick baking paper and rub with a tiny drop of oil. Drain the chickpeas and measure out 150ml of chickpea water (aquafaba). Put the chickpeas in the fridge or freezer to use later. Pour the aquafaba into the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl), add a pinch of salt and whisk on a high speed until white and very stiff.\nIn a bowl, combine the sugar and cream of tartar. Turn down the mixer speed a little, then add the sugar to the aquafaba one tablespoon at a time, making sure that each has dissolved before you add the next (you can check this by rubbing a little of the mixture between your fingers \u2013 if it\u2019s grainy, keep going). Add the vanilla, then whisk on high for another couple of minutes. The meringue should now be looking very thick and glossy.\nSpoon 10\u201312 piles of the meringue mixture on to the baking trays, making sure they have a little space to spread. Bake for two hours until crisp on the outside, turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside to cool completely \u2013 do not open the door while the meringues are cooking or cooling. The meringues will keep for two to three days in a sealed container.\nCut the citrus into segments or slices using a serrated knife. Catch any juice in a bowl and reserve. To make the caramel, heat the sugar in a heavy-based pan over a medium flame. Shake the pan so the sugar levels out. Allow the heat to melt the sugar and, gently swirling it (don\u2019t stir), turn up the heat and cook until the sugar turns a deep golden. Remove from the heat and add a little tangerine zest.\nServe the meringues with the whipped cream, drizzle with the caramel, and top with the citrus pieces and a dash of the reserved juice.\nMake sure it\u2019s thick enough. If you\u2019re using tinned chickpeas, the chances are it will be, but it can vary from brand to brand. If you\u2019re cooking your pulses from scratch, make sure you discard the soaking water and always cook your beans in fresh water. Cook and cool the beans, then drain, reserving the precious liquid. If the liquid isn\u2019t gloopy, reduce it by about a quarter. Make sure your aquafaba is well sieved; you don\u2019t want to end up with pieces of chickpea in your meringue.\nRules of thumb are: one tablespoon aquafaba = one yolk; two tablespoons = one white; three tablespoons = a whole egg.\nSo, in a cake that calls for three eggs, you would use nine tablespoons (or 135ml) of aquafaba. One 400g tin of beans will yield around 150ml of aquafaba.\nAquafaba always needs to be whisked before being added to cakes. Ideally use a stand mixer or electric whisk. Put in a scrupulously clean bowl, and whisk, just as you would with egg white to make meringue. The aquafaba is ready to use when it\u2019s holding its own and forming soft peaks with the whisk.\nThis base can be used for sweet or savoury pancakes. They are a great basic pancake for vegans \u2013 or anyone with a can of chickpeas. I\u2019ve gone with a savoury squash and herb oil topping here, turning them into a proper dinner. You could even roast the leftover chickpeas with the squash if you\u2019d like to include them in the recipe. To take them down a sweet route, stew some apple or pear, and serve with coconut yoghurt, maple syrup and toasted nuts.\nPrep 15 min\n Cook 45 min\n Makes 12\nFor the squash topping900g squash (1 butternut or 2 acorn), deseeded and cut into wedgesDrizzle of olive oilSaltBlack pepper1 red onion, peeled and thinly slicedJuice of 1 lemon1 red chilli, chopped2 sprigs thyme, leaves only50ml extra-virgin olive oil\nFor the batter1 x 400g tin chickpeas230g plain flourSalt1 tsp baking powder300ml almond milk or oat milkCoconut oil, for frying\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Toss the squash with a little oil, a pinch of salt and some ground pepper. Roast for 30 minutes, until deep golden and tender.\nMeanwhile, toss the onion in a bowl with the lemon juice and a good pinch of salt. Leave to pickle while the squash cooks.\nMix the chilli with the thyme leaves, extra-virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt, and put to one side.\nDrain the chickpeas and measure out 135ml of aquafaba. Whisk the aquafaba in a stand mixer, or with a hand whisk, to stiff peaks.\nSift together the flour, a good pinch of salt and the baking powder, then beat in the almond or oat milk until smooth. Gently fold the batter into the whipped aquafaba.\nHeat a frying pan over a medium flame. Once hot, add a little coconut oil and swirl around the pan. Spoon ladlefuls into the pan, leaving a little space in between. You will have to do this in batches, so keep the pancakes warm under foil or in a low oven until ready to serve. Fry for three to four minutes on each side, until puffed and golden.\nServe two or three pancakes per person on warmed plates, and top with the roasted squash, onions and chilli oil.",

        "content": "Military repeatedly pushed back long-awaited election amid fears of electoral rigging\nIt has been an improbable pipe dream for the people of Thailand in recent years but finally, it seems, the country is set to go to the polls.\nIn just under two months, according to the country\u2019s election commission, Thais will be given the chance to exercise their democratic right for the first time since elections in 2014 were invalidated. The scheduled vote on 24 February follows four years of oppressive and undemocratic rule by a military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), which took power in a bloodless coup in 2014.\nMany Thais remain sceptical that the long-awaited election \u2013 pushed back multiple times by the military junta on the dubious pretext that the country was not ready \u2013 will even happen, let alone do much to change the political structure of the country. Thailand\u2019s notoriously heavy-handed laws around freedom of speech will also still be in place.\nBut most are in agreement that any legitimacy the junta once claimed to rule Thailand without a democratic mandate has long since run out.\n\u201cThis will not be a fair election,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cBut it is a necessary first step for Thailand to regain some balance. There is a long way to go yet.\u201d\nDue to a rewriting of the whole Thai political system since the last valid election in 2011, determining how the election will play out is not easy but one thing is for certain: this will not be a vote that releases Thailand from the clutches of military rule. Since 1932, Thailand has endured 13 successful military coups as well as seven attempted coups, more than any other country in the world.\nIndeed, many fear that the election system will be so manipulated by the junta that 24 February will simply see the military returned to power through proxy political parties such as the Palang Pracharat party, recently formed by NCPO members, or will end up with Prayuth Chan-ocha, the incumbent prime minister under the military regime, selected to the role again.\n\u201cThe military are just making this election up as they go along,\u201d said Duncan McCargo, a political science professor at the University of Leeds specialising in south-east Asia. \u201cBut this time round the presence of an explicitly pro-military party, which we did not see in the last election, the long gap since the last competitive election, the continued restrictions on political activity and campaigning, and all kinds of built-in advantages to the junta all come together to make this election much harder to predict, and much less openly competitive than the last election.\u201d\nAs McCargo put it, \u201cthe rules of the game have been rigged\u201d, and certainly there are several factors skewing the whole electoral process in favour of the military. Over the past four years under its rule, all political campaigning, demonstrations and political parties have been suppressed \u2013 parties were only allowed to re-register in May. This has crippled the main opposition anti-military party, Pheu Thai, and prevented the emergence of other grassroots parties since 2014.\nEven more crucially, there is the new constitution, drawn up by the NCPO and passed by referendum in 2017, which locks in military power and was written with the specific intention of making it very difficult for an opposition party such as Pheu Thai to form a majority government again. According to the constitution, all 250 seats in the Thai senate are either directly selected by the military or chosen by a committee appointed by the military, and so it is only the lower parliamentary house, with 500 MPs, that is democratically elected. But even that has its problems.\n\u201cI see the constitution as the biggest source of political ailments and social grievances in Thailand,\u201d said Thitinan. \u201cIt is totally crooked and it was written to perpetuate military power in politics. The senate is a junta chamber and in the lower house they have obliterated the party system to make it entirely rigged for the military.\u201d\nThe new rules would make it very possible for Prayuth to be brought back in as prime minister, even if the military political parties do not win a majority. According to the constitution, the prime minister is to be selected from a list after the election by a \u201cjoint session\u201d of both senate and the lower house MPs. With all the senate already pro-military, he would need to club together 126 MPs in the lower house to win \u2013 just a quarter of the seats. Nonetheless, it still unclear whether the most conservative and pro-royalist party, the Democrat party \u2013 who have not won an election in decades but back in 2014 helped usher in the military coup \u2013 will remain loyal to the junta.\nFor observers, the scenario of Prayuth leading a minority coalition government could be highly problematic, not only because it would perpetuate the legacy of junta rule. \u201cLegislation would be in gridlock and the government would be highly unstable,\u201d said Thitinan.\nThe biggest competitor to the military remains the Pheu Thai party, which was created by the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Despite being ousted in a military coup in 2006 and forced into exile, Thaksin still looms large over Thai politics, and to this day Thailand is sharply divided down pro-Thaksin and anti-Thaksin lines.\nPolling by Pheu Thai and the military\u2019s intelligence wing reportedly suggests Pheu Thai still has the most support across Thailand, one of the many reasons cited for the military postponing the election for so long. However, Pheu Thai has failed to find a leader who can unite the party and draw the same loyalty as Thaksin.\nFrom January, parties will finally be allowed to campaign, though questions remain over the extent to which the junta will allow the opposition to freely spread its message. One party with a more progressive agenda is the Commoner party, led by the civil rights and environmental activist Lertsak Kamkongsak, which is still waiting to hear whether the military will allow it to register.\nLertsak was pessimistic about the election but said it was important to participate. \u201cThe whole system is messed up and totally against parties,\u201d he said. \u201cPrayuth will be the next prime minister for sure and this election will lead to the military government, but it won\u2019t be completely under their control. I think they will last one to two years, and then there will be another election again.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s going to be chaos. And [it will] probably lead to another coup.\u201d\nNavaon Siradapuvadol contributed reporting\n This article was amended on 11 January 2019. The headline and text of a previous version said that the upcoming election would be the first chance for Thais to vote in eight years. This did not take into account the election of February 2014, which was later invalidated by Thailand\u2019s constitutional court.",

It manages about \u20ac400bn in investments for Japanese clients. Its business in London mainly works as an asset manager investing in bonds, securities, private equity and real estate.\nUnder the terms of the withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration on the future relationship, firms in the City of London will lose their \u201cpassporting rights\u201d, which allow them to offer services across the EU from London,\nThe Dutch newspaper the FD reported the news by claiming that \u201cAmsterdam will soon be a bank richer again\u201d.\nThe chairman of the bank\u2019s board, Kazuto Oku, had previously suggested he wanted to diversify the range of Norinchukin\u2019s activities in Europe, and that the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU stood in the way of London benefiting.\nIn response, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency hailed the \u201cgood news that Norinchukin has chosen to continue to focus on the European financial market from the Netherlands\u201d.\n\u201cThe choice for our country confirms our status as a business centre in Europe,\u201d the agency added.\nThe UK has traditionally been seen as the gateway to Europe for major Japanese firms but last February, following a meeting with May in Downing Street, the country\u2019s ambassador, Koji Tsuruoka, was frank that a hit to the British economy and fresh barriers to trade would push his compatriots out of the country.\nJapan\u2019s biggest bank, the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) filed a licence to set up a new subsidiary in Amsterdam in 2017, citing the need to continue to serve customers in the EU after Brexit, having already shifted its main EU HQ for corporate and retail banking to the Dutch capital.\nOn Thursday, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, backed May by stating that it was \u201cthe wish of the whole world\u201d to see Britain secure an agreement with the EU.\nSpeaking in Downing Street, Abe said Japan offered total support to May and that Japanese companies employing 150,000 people in the UK would value the stability.\nThe withdrawal agreement provides for a 21-month transition period with a possible two-year extension, during which the UK will stay in the single market and customs union but without a say in any of the EU\u2019s decision-making institutions.\n\u201cJapan is in total support of the draft withdrawal agreement worked out between the EU and prime minister May, which provides for transition to ensure legal stability for businesses that have invested into this country,\u201d Abe said.\nThe Japanese leader\u2019s comments appeared to be an attempt at damage limitation rather than an endorsement of the UK\u2019s position outside the EU after 29 March. During the referendum campaign, Abe said a vote for leave would make the UK a less attractive country in which to invest.",

In a widely circulated screenshot, Vallelonga wrote in reply to Trump: \u201c100% correct. Muslims in Jersey City cheering when towers went down. I saw it, as you did, possibly on local CBS news.\u201d\nVallelonga received widespread condemnation, particularly as one of the film\u2019s stars, Mahershala Ali, is Muslim. One of the film\u2019s main financial backers, Participant Media, released a statement saying: \u201cWe find Mr Vallelonga\u2019s Twitter post offensive, dangerous, and antithetical to Participant Media\u2019s values. We reject it in no uncertain terms.\u201d\nHaving deleted his Twitter account, Vallelonga issued a statement, saying: \u201cI want to apologize. I spent my life trying to bring this story of overcoming differences and finding common ground to the screen, and I am incredibly sorry to everyone associated with Green Book. I especially deeply apologize to the brilliant and kind Mahershala Ali, and all members of the Muslim faith, for the hurt I have caused. I am also sorry to my late father who changed so much from Dr Shirley\u2019s friendship and I promise this lesson is not lost on me. Green Book is a story about love, acceptance and overcoming barriers, and I will do better.\u201d\nGreen Book \u2013 named after the celebrated guide book that enabled black motorists to avoid racial discrimination as they travelled across the US \u2013 is about an Italian-American driver/bodyguard played by Viggo Mortensen, based on Vallelonga\u2019s father Tony, who accompanies African-American pianist Don Shirley on a concert tour in the Jim Crow-era deep south. The film won three Golden Globes: for best film (musical or comedy), best supporting actor for Ali, and best screenplay, for which Vallelonga is credited, along with director Peter Farrelly and writer Brian Hayes Currie.\nVallelonga\u2019s apology follows one by Farrelly after a number of articles were unearthed in which Farrelly laughed off serial sexual misconduct, including repeatedly showing his penis in meetings. Farrelly said: \u201cI thought I was being funny and the truth is I\u2019m embarrassed and it makes me cringe now. I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\nDespite its liberal credentials, Green Book has found itself under an increasing tide of criticism, with the film\u2019s portrayal of a close friendship between Vallelonga and Shirley being flatly denied by Shirley\u2019s family in an interview with Shadow & Act. In the same article, Ali was reported to have apologised for any offence caused by his portrayal of Shirley (who died in 2013), and was quoted as saying: \u201cI did the best I could with the material I had.\u201d",

        "content": "Also this week: what space aliens would make of Brexit and a Spurs supporter longs for home\nMonday\nI\u2019ve long since given up making any New Year resolutions. Partly because I\u2019ve already given up more things than it seems reasonable to ask of any person and my exercise habit has already resulted in one total knee replacement, but mainly because I can\u2019t bear the sense of inevitable despair that comes from having broken most of the promises I made to myself by the middle of January.\nPerhaps the best I can manage is an acceptance that I\u2019m never really going to be the person I would like to be. In this I have an ideal role model: Chris Grayling, our transport secretary, whose life goal appears to be to embrace his inner uselessness.\nIt is one thing to first waste \u00a350,000 on failing to organise a lorry jam in Kent on a Monday morning and then another \u00a313.8m by awarding a ferry contract to a company that has no ferries, the mission statement of a pizza delivery company and directors whose main talent is corporate insolvency.\nBut it takes a really special type of politician to make a virtue of all these failings in his responses to an urgent question in the House of Commons. Grayling\u2019s main line of defence was that no money had actually been wasted in proving to the EU we weren\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit because none of the \u00a313.8m would be spent if no ferries ran. He appeared to have no idea that the whole purpose of a contingency plan was for there to be a contingency. I\u2019m going to miss him when he\u2019s gone.\nTuesday\nIt\u2019s 20 years ago today that my father died. He was 77 years old. Scarcely a day goes by when I don\u2019t think of him. I miss his kindness, his humility, his gentleness and his love and my lasting regret is that he died younger than we would all have liked and that he never got to see my children grow up. He would have been so proud of the adults they have become. His death took us all by surprise \u2013 he went in to hospital for a heart bypass operation and never regained consciousness \u2013 though not perhaps him.\nI think he knew he was a lot more ill than he had let on and I vividly remember watching him at the last Christmas dinner we shared as a family 10 days or so before he went into hospital. He seemed to be both there and not there at the same time. Not so much because he was withdrawing from us all but more as if he wanted time and space for himself to take in every detail. An eternity of memories.\nI also wonder if I had some second sense he might not survive the operation. A month earlier I had driven down to see him and set the final record straight. Our relationship hadn\u2019t always been the easiest when I was growing up. He could be distant \u2013 the war had a lasting effect on him \u2013 and I was a difficult, disappointing and troubled child.\nBut over the previous five or six years, we had learned to forgive each other and come to respect and love each other deeply. In that conversation, we told each other that whatever differences we had in the past had long since been settled and all that remained was love. It\u2019s still the most important conversation I have ever had.\nWednesday\nThrilling news for space geeks like myself. Astronomers have detected Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) of energy from deep space. While some have gone for the more prosaic explanation that the FRBs emanate from natural phenomena such as black holes or super-dense neutron stars, I\u2019d much rather believe scientists, such as Prof Avi Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian centre for astrophysics, who reckon they could be evidence of advanced alien technology.\nImagine the excitement of discovering the existence of extraterrestrial life. Help might be at hand for Earth after all. My one misgiving is that I only wish the aliens had chosen a better time. Checking in with us in 2019 and finding a British government and opposition lurching from crisis to crisis as they fail to come up with a Brexit solution, and a United States that is in shutdown over the president\u2019s absurd plan to build a $5bn shower door along the Mexican border, might make any even vaguely intelligent forms of extraterrestrial life have second thoughts about making further contacts.\nIf only they could have come seven years earlier during the London Olympics, when Great Britain was winning three track and field gold medals in an hour and the crowds were booing George Osborne for his austerity economics.\nThursday\nTalk about wishful thinking. Despite losing two votes in as many days and being totally clueless about how to resolve the immediate Brexit crisis, the government has come up with a 10-year plan for the NHS.\nPredictably, its reception has been lukewarm as most health professionals have reservations about its funding and cost-saving models. What alarms me most is the move towards doctors having more interactions with their patients over Skype, as it seems to me there can only be two outcomes to these consultations that don\u2019t involve a face-to-face meeting. Either the doctor decides there is nothing wrong with you based on how you appear \u2013 unlikely in most cases, as Skype has the unfortunate effect of making most people look ill \u2013 or she tells you there is nothing more she can do for you and that you are best off getting your affairs in order.\nI\u2019m also less than convinced by the government\u2019s commitment to improving mental health services, which seem to mainly involve the establishment of a call centre. Press 1 if you are feeling suicidal. Press 2 if you think you are psychotic. Press 3 if you suffer from bipolar disorders. Press 4 if you are Chris Grayling. For all other mental health enquiries please Press 5 so you can be held in a queue for 45 minutes before someone gets round to answering your call.\nFriday\nOne of the least unexpected emails of the new year arrives. It is from Tottenham Hotspur informing me that there have been further delays and that the earliest the football club will be moving in to the new stadium will be the middle of March. The reaction of every fan I know has been: \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when it happens.\u201d\nI\u2019m no expert on large building projects, other than that they invariably seem to overrun, but I\u2019d put money on the PR for the Spurs stadium delays winning an award for the worst campaign of the year. Almost every announcement the club has made has been both late and invariably couched in half-truths.\nGiven that the stadium is now running eight months \u2013 and counting \u2013 late, you\u2019d have thought that Spurs would have had some inkling that they weren\u2019t going to be moving back to their north London home long before the season began in August. But the first supporters got to hear of any delay was about a month before the first home game was due to be played.\nThen we were told we would be definitely moving by the middle of September. Since then, several other promised deadlines have come and gone and now most fans don\u2019t expect to be in the ground before the start of the next season. Had we been told the truth right from the off many fans would have been more accepting of the situation, but the drip-drip of misinformation is taking its toll.\nAlthough the team has been performing well on the field, many season ticket holders have voted with their feet and stayed away. Part of the pleasure of going to home games is seeing familiar faces and having a collective moan about life. This year, I have felt like a stranger in my own seat. The atmosphere at the ground has often been terrible, as Tottenham at Wembley has become a tourist destination for people hoping to catch a Premier League game. I feel alienated and dissociated. I want to go home.\nDigested week digested: Disorder, Disorder!",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe trickiest dress code to get right isn\u2019t smart-casual, it\u2019s smart-cold. Smart-cold doesn\u2019t get printed in invitations, but it is an unspoken dress code with which you will almost certainly have to grapple over the next two months. One can\u2019t neglect standards just because the mercury dips. It\u2019s too bad for morale.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIt goes without saying that keeping warm is the most important issue here; smart-cold is never about shivering or wearing fewer clothes. But if you abandon all sartorial coordinates and dress only for warmth, piling on random layers and hats and scarves and gloves, you end up lumpy and bundled and chaotic. Snowman-who-got-dressed-in-the-dark is not a good look, and streamlining your outfit can help you feel more in control of your battle with the elements.\nSo, three points. First: underwear. Uniqlo\u2019s HeatTech under layerings do the heavy lifting invisibly, while John Lewis 150 denier fleece-lined tights get me out of bed on the coldest mornings. Second: polo necks. There is almost no outfit not improved by a sleek polo neck. This is an off-white wool one I bought from Marks & Sparks a couple of years ago. A jacket or coat that has a bulky collar looks messy worn with a scarf, and this is just as warm. White has a pleasing 1970s apr\u00e8s-ski vibe that I enjoy (I can\u2019t ski, but that\u2019s irrelevant) and for a smart daytime look works well under an open-necked white shirt and a dark blazer.\nThird: colour. There is plenty of gloom and darkness at this time of year. Black can be chic, but when dark scarves and coats and boots are layered together, the overall effect becomes unhelpfully apocalyptic. I refer you, here, to two historic globally televised masterclasses in smart-cold dressing: both inauguration ceremonies starring the Obama family. In 2009, seven-year-old Sasha in a flamingo pink coat with coral scarf and gloves nailed smart-cold from the off. Can you do it? Yes, you can.\n Jess wears jacket, \u00a3369, whistles.com.

But this show, devised by Rhum and Clay and written by Isley Lynn, offers a fresh take by seeing it as a harbinger of the hoaxes that have accelerated over the last 80 years. Even if I\u2019d quarrel with some of the conclusions, I enjoyed the piece\u2019s wit, pungency and physical skill.\nFour actors swiftly evoke the original broadcast: dance-band music is intercut with on-the-spot reports from New Jersey where the Martians have supposedly landed. Whole books have been written about the hysteria this induced, but the play really gets going when Meena, a British media studies graduate, visits Grover\u2019s Mill, where the radio drama was set, to explore the truth of a story that a 13-year-old girl was abandoned by her terrified family. Meena discovers the town is filled with tourist sites commemorating a fictional event. We realise that we live in a world where the line between lies and truth has become increasingly blurred.\nThe show, with its reference to Trump and Brexit, fails to make a crucial distinction. Welles was an artist giving a radio drama a reportorial urgency: politicians tells porkies for their own ends. But, directed by Hamish MacDougall and Julian Spooner, the show is deft and ingenious without the self-advertising quality you sometimes find in devised pieces. The four actors simply stick a pipe in their mouths to become Orson Welles.\nBenjamin Grant\u2019s sound design reminds us of radio\u2019s capacity to make invasion from outer space seem plausible. A remote control is used to evoke a Grover\u2019s Mill geek\u2019s delight in creating fake facts that spread like a virus through the internet. The cast, including Mona Goodwin as the podcasting visitor and Amalia Vitale, Matthew Wells and Spooner himself as the bizarre family she meets, all play with great verve. It\u2019s a fast and clever show, even if its argument that we can be made to believe anything was pre-empted by Welles himself in his magical final movie, F for Fake.\nAt the New Diorama, London, until 9 February.",

        "content": "Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd unveils package of changes to benefits system\nThe government will seek to make universal credit payments to women if they are the household\u2019s main carer, Amber Rudd has said, as part of a package of changes to the heavily criticised benefits system that have been unveiled by the work and pensions secretary.\nRudd, who also said she wanted the long freeze on working-age benefit levels to end next year, used a speech at a jobcentre in south London to further emphasise what she said is a more caring and thoughtful approach to the welfare system.\nA key element to this is the news that the planned mass \u201cmigration\u201d of claimants on existing benefits to universal credit, which replaces a series of payments, would instead be paused so a trial of 10,000 people could be held.\nWhat is universal credit?\nUniversal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work. With a huge influx due to the economic impact of the coronavirus, in September 2020 there were 5.6 million people claiming UC.\nHow long has it been around?\nThe project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u00a0management failures, expensive\u00a0IT blunders and design faults\u00a0mean it is now seven years behind schedule, and full rollout will not be complete until 2024. The government admitted that the delay was caused in part by claimants being too scared to sign up to the new benefit.\nWhat is the biggest problem?\nThe original design set out a\u00a0minimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u00a0to claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u00a0rent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u00a0notable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u00a0\nMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.\nAre there other problems?\nPlenty.\u00a0Multibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u00a0imposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than \u00a31,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. \nLandlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It's also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. \nAnd there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.\n\u201cWe will tread cautiously,\u201d on the change, pledged Rudd, who took the work and pensions job when Esther McVey quit in November.\nRudd also confirmed the partial scrapping of the controversial two-child limit on universal credit payments, but only for this benefit and for children born after April 2017, when the wider limit was first introduced.\nShe defended the cap, and the \u201crape clause\u201d, under which women can claim exemption from the policy if they can show they had conceived a third child via domestic abuse or rape. The charity Women\u2019s Aid called the policy \u201cobjectionable\u201d and likely to hamper some women trying to flee domestic abuse.\nIn the speech, Rudd said she wanted universal credit to particularly help women, and she understood the criticism over the way the benefit was paid into a single bank account, which could be a problem for some couples or families.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m committed to ensuring that household payments go directly to the main carer, which is usually but not always the woman,\u201d she said.\nFor couples and families, 60% of payments already go to women, she said, adding: \u201cHowever, I am looking at what more we can do to enable the main carer to receive the UC payment, and we\u2019ll begin to make those payments later this year.\u201d\nOther changes outlined by Rudd include a new online system for private landlords to request direct payments for tenants who have problems managing money, and changes to pay childcare costs in advance if needed.\nOn the benefits freeze, which was introduced in 2015 by the then chancellor George Osborne and is estimated to have cost some working families hundreds of pounds a year, Rudd confirmed she wanted it to end but had yet to discuss this with the chancellor, Philip Hammond.\nAsked about this after the speech, she said: \u201cThe benefits freeze is scheduled to come to an end next year. I haven\u2019t had any further conversations with the chancellor, so I\u2019d better not say anything too definitive at this stage, but it would certainly be my view that it should come to an end at that stage.\u201d\nBut Rudd defended the principle of the two-child limit: \u201cI think it is fair that those on welfare make the same considered decisions as other taxpayers who support themselves solely though work.\n\u201cSo I believe it was right to limit the number of children for whom support can be provided through universal credit funded by the taxpayer. However, I believe it is unfair to apply that limit retrospectively.\u201d\nThis prompted criticism from Sian Hawkins, Women\u2019s Aid\u2019s head of campaigns, who said children born after April 2017 \u201care still subject to this objectionable policy\u201d, while the rape clause exemption \u201cdoes not reflect survivors\u2019 lived experience of disclosing domestic abuse and rape\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cWe know from our work with survivors that many women do not have the confidence to speak out about their experience of domestic abuse or rape due to feelings of shame, worrying about the repercussions for their children and fears of the consequences of doing so.\u201d",

        "content": "Tesco fares well over festive period but John Lewis, M&S, Debenhams and Halfords all suffer\nThe 2018 festive shopping season in the UK got under way with low expectations for the retail sector. Investors were braced for bad news after a string of warnings in the run-up to Christmas, including a declaration from Mike Ashley, the chief executive of Sports Direct, that November was the worst on record for retailers. Against a backdrop of rising rents, business rates, a shift to online shopping and diminishing consumer confidence, retailers had to battle to win customers over the crucial trading period. Here are the winners and losers so far.\nTesco\nBritain\u2019s largest retailer was a clear winner, enjoying its best Christmas in nearly a decade. Like-for-like sales, stripping out shops open for less than a year, grew by 2.2% in the six weeks to 5 January, boosted by higher demand for its cheapest range, Exclusively at Tesco, while its more upmarket \u201cFinest\u201d range also fared well. Sales of the supermarket\u2019s \u201cFree from\u201d range of gluten-free and wheat-free products \u2013 the largest in the UK \u2013 rose by 11%.\nNext\nOne of the best-known names on the high street enjoyed a better-than-expected Christmas after a late surge in online sales. The retailer, considered a bellwether for the whole sector, reported overall sales growth of 1.5% for the last two months of 2018. As one of only a few retailers to resist pre-Christmas discounting, Next was expected to struggle as its rivals slashed prices to entice shoppers suffering Brexit jitters. As it turned out, it was saved by online sales, which rose 15.2% over the period. Sales in its shops, however, were down 9.2%.\nMorrisons\nThe UK\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket chain just about beat expectations after achieving growth in like-for-like sales for a fourth consecutive Christmas. Sales across its core supermarket business rose 0.6% in the nine weeks to 9 January, slightly above analysts\u2019 expectations of a 0.5% increase. Morrisons said customers were \u201cincreasingly savvy\u201d and that it had benefited from being competitive on price, with a basket of Christmas goods unchanged from last year.\nLidl/Aldi\nThe German discounters secured their biggest ever slice of the Christmas food spend in 2018 as two-thirds of UK households headed to their shops for festive fare. Sales at Lidl rose 8% in the six weeks to 30 December with demand for the premium Deluxe range up by a third. Aldi has only disclosed record sales in the week before Christmas, up 10% on 2017. Aldi also trumpeted strong demand for premium products, such as beef chateaubriand and 32-year-old French brandy. New store openings were also a major factor behind Aldi\u2019s near \u00a31bn sales\u2019 haul in December.\nJD Sports\nThe UK\u2019s biggest sports retailer had plenty to celebrate over Christmas as booming sales of \u201cathleisure\u201d \u2013 sportswear designed to be worn outside the gym \u2013 made it a firm winner. Total sales (including newly opened shops) surged 15% in the 48 weeks to 5 January. Like-for-like sales rose 5% and were consistently positive over the Black Friday and festive period, according to the Manchester-based retailer. The chain also credited its decision not to follow rivals into big price cuts, which kept gross profit margins at the previous year\u2019s levels. JD Sports has raised its profit guidance.\nBoohoo\nThe online fashion retailer aimed at the under-30s upgraded its full-year profit guidance after strong Christmas sales. Revenue rose 44% in the four months to 31 December, thanks to a 33% rise in UK sales and a 78% rise in the US. A strong performance from the retailer, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands, also eased fears that the struggles facing high street retailers were spreading online, after rival web-only retailer Asos issued a profits warning in December.\nGreggs\nBritain\u2019s biggest bakery chain had a stronger-than-expected finish to 2018, thanks to bumper sales in December of its festive bakes, mince pies, hot drinks and breakfast ranges. Trading was so strong that it prompted Gregg to raise its 2018 profits guidance for the second time in two months. In the fourth quarter overall, like-for-like sales were up 5.2%. The food retailer said trading in 2019 had got off to a strong start, with its new vegan sausage roll \u201cflying off the shelves\u201d.\nTed Baker\nIn festive trading terms at least, Ted Baker emerged unscathed by recent allegations of a culture of \u201cforced hugs\u201d under its founder, Ray Kelvin. Retail sales increased 12.2% in the five weeks to 5 January, boosted by more selling space and strong growth online. The fashion brand said men\u2019s and women\u2019s coats, jackets and knitwear were among the best sellers as the colder weather kicked in.\nDunelm\nDemand for unicorn-themed goods and a slicker online operation helped Dunelm to better-than-expected sales growth over Christmas. Sales in its core Dunelm brand increased by nearly 10% to \u00a3304m in the 13 weeks to 29 December, prompting the home furnishings group to upgrade its full-year profit expectations. Unicorn bedding and rocking horses were among the bestsellers, as were sheepskin rugs.\nJoules\nA strong online performance drove bumper sales at Joules in the seven weeks to 6 January. The clothing retailer, known for its bright floral prints and pink wellies, said sales increased by 11.7% over the period, with growth across all of its product ranges. Bestsellers included accessories such as purses, handbags and watches as well as knitwear and footwear. Orders placed online \u2013 both on its own website and through concession partners\u2019 websites \u2013 accounted for almost half of its sales.\nAO World\nThe white goods retailer was pleased with its performance during the Black Friday deals window, with less lumpy sales and improved profit margins contributing to its highest November sales ever. UK revenues rose by 4.4% year-on-year in the last quarter, while its European expansion continued, with revenues up by 31.3%. Steve Caunce, chief executive, said the company was \u201con track\u201d, despite the \u201cchallenging backdrop\u201d in retail.\nMarks & Spencer\nChristmas wasn\u2019t very merry at one of Britain\u2019s best-known retailers, with sales down across its food, clothing and homewares divisions. Chief executive Steve Rowe said a combination of mild weather, Black Friday, weaker consumer confidence and widespread discounting by competitors had weighed on sales, which were down 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell by 2.1% and clothing and home sales fell by 2.4%.\nJohn Lewis Partnership\nJohn Lewis Partnership is a mixed bag. Sales across the group rose by 1.4% in the seven weeks to 5 January, including a like-for-like rise of 1% at the John Lewis department stores and a 0.3% rise at Waitrose. However, a weaker consumer backdrop and heavy discounting among rivals \u2013 which it is forced to match under its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d policy \u2013 weighed on margins. As a result, the Partnership warned profits will be \u201csubstantially lower this year\u201d. In what would be a major blow to its workers, chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield also warned the retailer may be forced to suspend its staff bonus this year for the first time since the economic downturn of 1953.\nDebenhams\nThere was no improvement in fortunes at Debenhams, with the struggling department store chain\u2019s difficulties deepening after its trading update as major shareholder Mike Ashley dramatically ousted both its chairman and the chief executive from the board. Like-for-like sales fell 6.2% in the 18 weeks to 5 January, with Debenhams emphasising a \u201cvolatile\u201d trading backdrop and customers seeking out promotions. The company said it still expected to meet profit targets but only after \u00a330m of additional cost savings, including a hiring freeze at its head office and the earlier-than-planned closure of its Lodge Farm distribution centre in Northamptonshire.\nSainsbury\u2019s\nSales at the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain fell more than expected over the festive period, which the retailer blamed on consumer caution and fewer Black Friday discounts at its Argos chain. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 1.1%, dragged down by falling sales of toys, clothing, homewares and large electrical goods. Grocery sales actually rose over the period, by 0.4%. The chief executive, Mike Coupe, said competition in non-food was heightened this year: \u201cThere were a lot of retailers in distress and a lot of discounted stock out there.\u201d\nHMV\nA clear loser was HMV, which announced on 28 December it was calling in administrators for the second time in six years, putting more than 2,200 jobs at risk. The music and film retailer said firms across the sector were facing \u201ca tsunami of challenges\u201d and that festive trading at HMV had been \u201cextremely weak\u201d. The 97-year-old company has also lost out during a period of rapid change for the entertainment industry, with consumers increasingly ditching CDs and DVDs in favour of streaming sites such as Spotify and Netflix.\nQuiz\nThe problems for the womenswear retailer were clear well before Christmas, but poor holiday trading prompted the second profit warning in just over three months. Its profit outlook for the year ending in March was cut by almost 30% to \u00a38.2m, and shares suffered a similar fall after its announcement. Heavy discounting amid intense competition was a key reason for disappointing revenue. Analysts at City investment house Brewin Dolphin noted that higher costs will prompt doubts about its ability to generate enough cash.\nFootasylum\nThe struggling footwear and hoodie chain said tough trading conditions continued through Christmas, prompting it to slash prices more than expected. Revenues rose 14% over the 18 weeks to 29 December but Footasylum warned its decision to cut prices had hit margins, and full-year earnings are likely to be at the lower end of analysts\u2019 forecasts. Its shares, the worst performers in the retail sector last year when they plunged by 90%, slithered to a new all-time low after the warning.\nMothercare\nMothercare\u2019s problems continued over the key festive trading period as the retailer blamed a sharp fall in sales on a tough consumer backdrop and its decision to offer fewer discounts than a year earlier. The baby and maternity chain said sales at UK stores open for more than a year fell by 11.4% in the 13 weeks to 5 January, while online sales tumbled by 16.3%. The retailer is in the middle of a store closure plan, with with another 36 shops to close over the next three months. By the end of March, Mothercare will have only 79 shops in the UK, down from 137 in May last year.\nHalfords\nHalfords blamed a slump in sales on the mild weather and dwindling consumer confidence. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 2.2% in the 14 weeks to 4 January, mainly driven by a drop in sales of car accessories and maintenance products, which it blamed on the mild weather, meaning that drivers did not need de-icer or new windscreen wipers. But the weather couldn\u2019t be blamed for a 0.3% dip in cycle sales, with growth in children\u2019s bikes offset by a fall in more expensive adult bicycles.\nAsos\nThe online clothing retailer sent alarm bells ringing across the City in mid-December when it was forced to issue a profits warning after poor trading in November. The gloomy update surprised and alarmed investors, demonstrating that despite its online-only offering, Asos was not immune to the high street struggle. Asos blamed weak consumer confidence, increased discounting and unusually mild weather for a \u201csignificant deterioration\u201d in November trading, which it said would weigh on its full-year sales growth. Shares fell 38%.\nBonmarch\u00e9\nThe value womenswear chain was another retailer forced into a profits warning in December, citing \u201cunprecedented\u201d trading conditions on the high street, worse than the 2008-09 recession. Shares plunged 40% as the chain aimed at women over 50 said \u201cextremely poor\u201d Black Friday sales and the impact of Brexit uncertainty on consumer demand had wiped out any hopes of a profit in the full year to the end of March 2019.\nMoss Bros\nSuit retailer Moss Bros is expected to post a loss for the financial year, posting a like-for-like sales decline of 1% for the 23 weeks to 5 January. Physical stores suffered from lower footfall, with the company noting that its highest-profile locations fared worst. Margins were also eaten away as its resistance to heavy discounting eventually broke, although online sales rose by a more than quarter year-on-year, offering a bright spot. Brian Brick, the Moss Bros boss, warned 2019 will likely have more pain in store amid weak demand, rising costs and Brexit uncertainty.",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThere\u2019s a lot of noise right now about vegan wines, as if they\u2019re some huge new trend. In fact, these days a great many wines are already made in a way that makes them suitable, and have been for some time. The key requirement is that no animal-derived products are used in their production, ruling out isinglass (fish bladder), egg whites and milk protein during fining, a clarifying process.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nBut how can you tell? Well, almost all supermarket own-label wines make it clear, plus an increasing number of producers put the information on their labels, and organic sites such as Vintage Roots list wines that are vegan. Yet this doesn\u2019t guarantee that vegans will regard them favourably. Just as food can contain plenty of E numbers, it\u2019s perfectly possible for a commercial wine that\u2019s made in huge quantities to use additives in the winemaking process. If that concerns you, look out for natural or organic wines that are not fined or filtered.\nMy latest find, discovered in the last days of 2018 and definitely one of my wines of the year, is a glorious Australian cabernet franc called \u2013 would you believe \u2013 Gertie, which is made in the Clare Valley and named after the winemaker Ben Marx\u2019s great-aunt. It\u2019s the antithesis of how most people view Australian wine: unfined, unfiltered, with vibrantly fresh, scrunchy fruit, made with natural yeasts and the minimum of sulphur. Just lovely.\nThere\u2019s also the question of the style of wine you might be looking for. If you\u2019re eating a plant-based diet without vast hunks of protein, you don\u2019t actually need a blockbuster red to set it off. Obviously, many vegan dishes have big flavours, but they don\u2019t tend to have the effect that rare meat or dairy products, such as cream and cheese, have in taming tannin; though pulses such as lentils and beans will, to an extent, round off rough edges. Instead, it\u2019s better to look for slightly lighter wines, particularly if you\u2019re embarking on a post-Christmas retrenchment, eating more salads and vegetables, and cutting down on the carbs.\nLight red wines such as the Sicilian frappato, which is stocked by Ocado, and the same outlet\u2019s Forte Alto Pinot Grigio Vigneti delle Dolomiti 2014, which is \u00a39.79 and a modest 12% (it\u2019s also stocked at the same price by Waitrose), would both make a refreshing counterpoint to healthy new year food.\n\u00a38, 13%.\nThe name exaggerates, but this organic and vegan wine is a perfectly nice, fresh, Spanish white that would be great with raw veg and dips.\n\u00a35.99, Lidl, 13.5%.\nIncredibly well-priced, fragrant Rh\u00f4ne white made from muscat, but dry rather than sweet.

I received many in-depth descriptions, from men, of sexual encounters they\u2019d had, because they thought I\u2019d \u2018just like to know\u2019,\u201d she revealed.\nIn particular, the conflation of Margot\u2019s experience in the story \u2013 a 20-year old single woman who begins dating a man \u2013 and her own, as a 36-year-old who had begun her first relationship with a woman, was troubling: \u201cI felt intensely protective of Margot, and of the readers who identified with her and, at the same time, I felt like an impostor. I felt as though if I were truthful about who I was, I would let everyone down.\u201d\nAs thinkpieces, tweets and reviews began pulling the story and its surprise success apart, Roupenian was left dealing with \u201ca torrent of unvarnished, unpolished opinion \u2026 delivered directly to my eyes and my brain\u201d. Receiving such overwhelming volumes of feedback \u2013 good and bad \u2013 \u201cknowing, in that immediate and unmediated way, what people thought about my writing felt \u2026 the word I keep reaching for, even though it seems melodramatic, is annihilating. To be faced with all those people thinking and talking about me was like standing alone, at the centre of a stadium, while thousands of people screamed at me at the top of their lungs. Not for me, at me. I guess some people might find this exhilarating. I did not.\u201d\nRoupenian\u2019s debut book, a short-story collection called You Know You Want This, was published in the US this week and is due out in the UK in February. US critics have been divided about the collection\u2019s success, with Slate calling it \u201cweird and pervy\u201d, the Boston Globe praising it as \u201cscintillating\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d, and the New York Times deeming it \u201ca dull, needy book\u201d.",

His death was following a yellow fever vaccination.\nGore, who was widely respected for his work, was professor of cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research and a consultant at the Marsden.\nPrince William, who is patron of the Marsden, paid tribute. \u201cI\u2019ve found Martin a source of inspiration,\u201d he said, adding that Gore\u2019s \u201cpassion for his work, and his obvious compassion and kindness for his patients, their family and friends, reinforces my knowledge that the Royal Marsden is a truly special place\u201d.\nWilliam added: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the pioneers of 20th-century cancer care, and a friend, colleague and trusted doctor to many.\u201d\nSenior scientists expressed their sadness. Prof Peter Openshaw, a former president of the British Society for Immunology, said Gore \u201cwas a leader in the field of cancer biology and made a huge contribution to research in this area and the treatment of many thousands of patients. My thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues.\u201d\nYellow fever vaccination certificates are required by some countries as a condition of entry. Deaths from the vaccination were very rare, but there was a higher risk among older people, said Openshaw.\nHe said: \u201cYellow fever is a serious viral disease that is found in the tropics and spread by mosquito bite. The vaccine for yellow fever has been available for many years and multiple studies have been conducted into its safety and effectiveness.\n\u201cWhile overall risk of serious side-effects remains very low (at about one in 100,000 of vaccine recipients), it seems that people aged over 60 have a three to fourfold increased risk of experiencing these serious effects compared with younger people. However, this estimate is based on very few reported adverse events.\n\u201cThis risk has to be balanced against the risk of contracting yellow fever if you are travelling to an infected area \u2013 a nasty disease with a high mortality rate.\u201d\nOpenshaw added: \u201cThe NHS advises that all people over the age of 60 talk to their doctor before getting this vaccine, and that the best way to avoid the serious complications that may follow yellow fever infection is not to travel to parts of the world that put you at risk.\u201d\nYellow fever vaccine contained a live attenuated form of the virus, said Dr Louisa James, a lecturer in immunology at Queen Mary University of London.\nShe said: \u201cYellow fever vaccine works by activating an immune response against the virus and this response can protect against infection for life. Yellow fever vaccine is highly effective and mass vaccination campaigns in the early 20th century led to a disappearance of the disease in many African countries.\n\u201cMore than 600m doses of yellow fever vaccine have been given worldwide and it is safe for the majority of individuals. Yellow fever vaccine can very rarely cause severe side-effects, including life-threatening illness. People over 60 appear to have a slightly higher risk of experiencing side-effects from yellow fever vaccine but the risk remains extremely low.\n\u201cVaccination is an essential strategy to combat the devastating impact of yellow fever virus which killed tens of thousands of people during recent outbreaks in Africa.\u201d\n This article was amended on 14 January 2019. After publication, a correction to a quote provided to the Guardian was issued: the yellow fever vaccine has been shown to provide lifelong protection against infection, not \u201cfor up to 10 years\u201d. In addition, the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust did not say Prof Martin Gore died \u201cas a result of a yellow fever vaccination\u201d, as an earlier version said. Gore died following a yellow fever vaccination, and the trust released a statement confirming his death. This has been corrected.",

        "content": "The actor\u2019s distinctive acting style is the only reason to watch this silly C-grade pulp filled with stilted dialogue and bad CGI\nIf you\u2019re going to make a bad movie, the smartest thing you can do is hire Keanu Reeves to star in it. As of late, he\u2019s been doing a lot of fine work with vision-driven directors\u2019 understanding of his distinctive manner of performance \u2013 Ana Lily Amirpour, Nicolas Winding Refn, and the John Wick braintrust of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, to name only a few. But his bread and butter remains the C-grade sci-fi/action picture, a disreputable micro-genre defined by the mandate it places on its actors to deliver mounds of dialogue that might as well be in Esperanto with a straight face.\nReeves is made to say many silly things in the unstudied new film Replicas, and he says them all with the bone-deep conviction of a doctor informing someone that their loved one has died. When he growls, \u201cboot the mapping sequence,\u201d we believe that he needs the mapping sequence booted. No one knows what a mapping sequence is, or why it must be booted with such urgency, but his words have an underlying emotional truth that begins and ends with The Keanu Essence. His method is an emphatic nothingness, mesmerizing to watch flourish in a movie incompetent enough to count on him to carry it. Reeves should probably be above such fly-by-night gigs at this juncture of his career, but Replicas reaps the benefits of his generosity.\nHe\u2019s just the man to carry a diet-Asimov story about unnaturally reconstituted bodies that is itself hideously forged from equal parts stagnation, implausibility, tedium and internal contradiction. Reeves dons the furrowed brow of a biomedical engineer as Will Foster, the harried genius who\u2019s this close to cracking the secret to human-consciousness-to-robot-body transplantation, dammit! He\u2019s still got to work out some kinks, but the wonky process gets an unexpected test run when a car crash claims his wife, probably named Wife (Alice Eve), along with his children, Child 1 (Emily Alyn Lind), Child 2 (Emjay Anthony), and Child 3 (Aria Lyric Leabu).\nThe same technology used to put person-thoughts in an electric shell can apparently be used to put a dead person\u2019s brain in a clone of themselves, or maybe the clone comes pre-packaged with its old awareness, or maybe that Will and his sidekick Ed (Thomas Middleditch, riding the blockbuster wave past the neo-Godzilla franchise as far as it\u2019ll take him) have achieved cloning in the first place is supposed to be the big deal. Either way, the next half-hour-plus consists mostly of narrative back-and-forth pacing while the bodies gestate, a stasis as torturous as waiting for an Easy-Bake Oven to turn a chocolate poultice into brownies.\nNobody could reasonably expect even a native speaker of English to make sense of all the quarter-baked ideas dribbled on to the pages of the script. All the audience really needs to know is that man has succeeded in permeating the lines of mortality, which has made Will and Ed\u2019s boss (John Ortiz) mad for expectedly sketchy reasons, and so stakes have been established. Trust us, Reeves\u2019s eyes reassure the viewer, there are stakes now. It is because he makes us want to trust him that Reeves is a talented actor, and because he must do this that Replicas is a defective movie.\nThe metaphor potential of carbon copies coming out braindead makes itself un-ignorable as the director, Jeffrey Nachmanoff, rips off John Frankenheimer\u2019s seminal body-switch thriller Seconds, only for everything to go wrong. While I\u2019ve never helmed my own high-concept genre feature, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s in the best interest of the production to allow the CGI to finish rendering before sending the movie out to be shown in theaters. It\u2019s no more amateurish than the acting coming from all non-Keanu Reeves cast members, who deliver the stilted language as if it might bite them on the tongue. After what may be one hundred hours, the film does not so much end as it stops, the score\u2019s wrapping-up tone an evident substitute for closure or resolution. Even Tarsem Singh held himself to a slightly higher standard in his disastrous Frankenheimer duplicate, the inert Self/Less. In replicating a replication, Nachmanoff\u2019s test subject came out missing a few key cranial lobes.\nAn evolutionary marvel, Reeves has figured out how to adapt to the hostile environment of mediocrity, and here he takes to the gobbledygook and gaps in logic like a genetically altered fish to water. When the guy\u2019s good, he\u2019s great, and when he\u2019s bad, he\u2019s still serviceable. If only anyone else involved could muster a fraction of the consummate professionalism that Reeves brings to his dead-serious intonation of the word \u201calgorithm\u201d, this DOA science project might have had a pulse.\nReplicas is now out in the US with a UK date to be announced",

But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.\u201d\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, it\u2019s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others \u2013 be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian \u2013 endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month\u2019s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.\nWhat are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article \u2018It\u2019ll take a village to reform global education\u2019:\n  \u201cMore than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We\u2019re even further from ensuring the world\u2019s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.\u201d\nOne thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing \u2013 we know where we want to get to, but we don\u2019t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.\nWhat are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?\nNow we\u2019d like to hear from you. What ideas do you have for education? How do you think we can make it more inclusive? What can we learn from other societies? Or what questions would you like answered?

        "content": "In town once synonymous with tragedy, the affection for Murray the man \u2013 as much as the player \u2013 is evident\nThe Friday morning coaching sessions are in full swing at Dunblane Tennis Club, where Andy Murray and his elder brother, Jamie, began their sporting careers nearly three decades ago.\nJosh Thomson, 20, is punting a bucket of balls to his adult learners\u2019 class under a leaden sky, while the news of Andy Murray\u2019s emotional overnight announcement, that he plans to retire from tennis after Wimbledon, settles on the club and the town.\nThomson, who started playing tennis at the age of six, just as the gangly teenager from Dunblane began to raise interest on the international tennis circuit, puts it simply: \u201cHe represented Scotland the way we want to be represented.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating news that this has happened in what should have been his peak years,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up, Andy Murray was the player I wanted to be. But also look at what he\u2019s achieved, not just the wins but the way he goes about it, his humour, his support for equality, the way he shot down reporters for their comments.\u201d\nMurray\u2019s sense of humour, most vivid in his Instagram account, is notoriously dry and, at times, has been so understated as to be missed by commentators unfamiliar with this peculiarly Scottish seam of wit. But Murray\u2019s trademark understatement is also what endears him, especially so in Dunblane, a town too familiar with extremes. Both Murray brothers were pupils at Dunblane primary school and in class the day that Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 children and one teacher on 13 March 1996.\nLikewise, in a town that has come to expect some degree of misrepresentation, locals appreciate his authenticity: Murray\u2019s passion on the court is real, as are his tears and his mammoth sulks.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an idol,\u201d says Thomson. \u201cHe\u2019s left an amazing legacy and he\u2019s done everything he can to help younger players.\u201d\nNicola Wishart is playing practice doubles under Josh\u2019s instruction. Her two children, who attend Dunblane primary, also play at the club. \u201cThey found out this morning and they were really upset. It\u2019s so sad to see him having to stop before he wants to.\u201d\nFor Wishart, Murray\u2019s impact on the next generation is inestimable: \u201cThere\u2019s a really strong coaching programme at the club here and the kids all love it. But across the country now there\u2019s a whole generation thinking they can be great sportspeople, watching Andy and Jamie and feeling that anything is possible.\u201d\nAs the morning coaching sessions draw to a close, Brian Melville, a semi-professional coach who first encountered Murray as a four-year-old, describes the boy he trained regularly at the club from the age of seven: \u201cHe was just a winner. He didn\u2019t want to be second, he wanted to win, even at that age. I called it grit and determination.\u201d\nMurray\u2019s legacy is this: \u201cWhen you think about Dunblane, you think about Andy Murray.\u201d What is unsaid is the particular resonance of this achievement for a town that was previously synonymous with tragedy.\nAlong Dunblane high street, which curves down the hill from the golden postbox that commemorates Murray\u2019s London 2012 Olympic victory, the affection and appreciation for Murray the man \u2013 as much as the player \u2013 is evident. \u201cHe\u2019s got to look after his health,\u201d says Mairi Ross, serving behind the counter at Fresh As A Daisy laundry. \u201cHe\u2019s got to do it for himself and his family.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have other opportunities,\u201d says her colleague Lizanne Richards. \u201cHe can go into commentating, and there are all these other things he can do. He\u2019s got plenty of time ahead of him.\u201d She pauses: \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t imagine it happening to a local boy.\u201d\nVal Mutch, a volunteer at the Sue Ryder shop, is pragmatic: \u201cEnough is enough. He looked in so much pain and he\u2019s done everything he can. He\u2019ll be sadly missed but I don\u2019t see him disappearing. He still has so much to give.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been inspirational for the town,\u201d agrees Ellen Hughes, who is organising raffle tickets. \u201cThe excitement here when he won Wimbledon, got married, had children, was incredible. He brought so much to Dunblane.\u201d\n\u201cI also like how he\u2019s championed women in sport,\u201d adds Mutch. \u201cHe\u2019s such a fair, good person. He stands up for fairness because he knows he\u2019s got a voice now.\u201d\nEllen agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him develop from this wee shy person. He was so awkward at first, especially in front of the media. He\u2019s had to grow up in public.\u201d\nBBC Scotland\u2019s morning phone-in show posed one question on Friday: \u201cWhat is your message for Andy Murray?\u201d Callers from Elgin to Eyemouth filled the airwaves with voices choked with emotion, offering fond iterations of the same basic message: \u201cThank you.\u201d",

        "content": "Barbican, LondonIn an all-Nordic programme, the 2013 song cycle Let Me Tell You lost none of its ability to bewitch in a concert that also featured Sibelius and Nielsen\nWhen Hans Abrahamsen\u2019s song cycle Let Me Tell You received its British premiere in Birmingham in 2014, six months after its first performance in Munich, it seemed an almost impossibly beautiful work, conjuring orchestral textures of extraordinary delicacy and freshness to support its apparently weightless soprano lines. Further performances and a recording haven\u2019t dulled that shimmering originality. If any work of the first two decades of the 21st century seems destined to embed itself in the repertory, then it is surely these settings of Paul Griffiths\u2019s elusive, fragile texts.\nSung as seraphically as ever by Barbara Hannigan for whom the cycle was composed, Let Me Tell You was the centrepiece of Simon Rattle\u2019s latest London Symphony Orchestra programme. It seemed as bewitching as ever. Abrahamsen\u2019s textures sounded more sharp-edged than before in the Barbican acoustic, and an ideal balance between Hannigan\u2019s soaring, tremulous phrases and the orchestra\u2019s glinting, pulsing colours was harder to negotiate, but the sense of a work unlike any other was as strong as before.\nRattle framed this 21st-century Nordic masterpiece with two 20th-century ones: Sibelius\u2019s Seventh Symphony and Nielsen\u2019s Fourth (the \u201cInextinguishable\u201d). His approach to Sibelius has become more massive and deliberately moulded over the years, and this account of the final and formally most radical of the symphonies did not move with quite the certainty it should. The ending seemed almost perfunctory, despite the undeniable power and majesty of many passages leading towards it. But the energy of Nielsen\u2019s symphonic writing still suits Rattle well and he responded to the Inextinguishable\u2019s intensity and conflict with tremendous gusto, which the LSO conveyed with irresistible force.\n Available on BBC Sounds.",

        "content": "Anti-doping programmes in Britain will be the priority as two jockeys in Ireland are given five-year suspensions after returning positive tests \nThe British Horseracing Authority said on Friday that \u201can overall review of the anti-doping education program\u201d for jockeys will be \u201ca priority\u201d in 2019, and that a review of the penalty structure for riders testing positive for cocaine and recreational drugs could be included \u201cif appropriate\u201d. For the moment, however, the BHA has \u201cno immediate plans\u201d to follow the lead of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB), its Irish counterpart, which said this week that its new standard punishment for a cocaine positive will be a five-year ban.\nThere has been a slight rise in the number of jockeys returning positive tests for cocaine on British tracks in recent years, and while there was just one positive in 2018, there were three in 2015 and two in both 2016 and 2017, following a six-year period from 2009 to 2014 with just one cocaine positive in total.\nIn Ireland, though, there have been 13 positives in just four years, including a single afternoon at Galway in 2017 when eight jockeys were selected for random testing from around 30 at the track, and three tested positive. The IHRB took this as a clear sign that it faced a serious problem, and having initially raised its standard penalty for a first offence to a four-year ban, it has now gone further to five.\nThe relative size of the racing industries in Britain and Ireland also needs to be taken into account, as there are around 1,500 meetings per year in Britain and just 350 in Ireland. The BHA could certainly argue that the IHRB\u2019s stiff new penalty is an Irish response to what is, on the face of it, an Irish problem, but it intends to keep the issue under consideration all the same.\n\u201cDr Jerry Hill [the BHA\u2019s chief medical advisor] has made an overall review of the anti-doping education program a priority in 2019,\u201d Robin Mounsey, the BHA\u2019s head of media, said on Friday.\n\u201cThis will include an assessment of cocaine and recreational drugs and will include looking at how prevalent their use is, how much guidance, education and support is in place for participants and, if appropriate, our penalty structure. However, there are no immediate plans on the penalties aspect at present off the back of the Irish announcement.\u201d\nConor Murphy, an amateur with one winner from a dozen rides in the current season, was the first rider to receive a five-year ban after a hearing in Ireland on Thursday.\nDamien Melia, an apprentice, received a four-year ban the same afternoon, though they will be able to reapply for a jockeys\u2019 licence after 18 months and nine months respectively if they engage fully in the interim with the Irish regulator\u2019s medical team, led by the much-respected Dr Adrian McGoldrick. A third jockey is also rumoured to have tested positive, and can expect a similar penalty if the result is confirmed when the case is heard.\nOn both sides of the Irish Sea, a five-year ban has previously been reserved for the most serious offences, normally those involving deliberate cheating or corruption. The current penalty for a positive test for cocaine returned by a jockey in Britain is a six-month suspension, and only a third offence in the space of three years could attract anything close to a five-year ban.\nAnd for the moment, the British penalty seems appropriate to the apparent scale of the problem. The failure rate when testing for cocaine hit a peak of 1% \u2013 three positives from 295 tests \u2013 in 2015 and has dropped to 0.46%, 0.5% and 0.2% over the last three seasons. Cocaine takes three days to clear a user\u2019s system, meanwhile, and with so much more racing in Britain than Ireland, it is also more difficult for a jockey to take regular extended breaks from the saddle without arousing suspicion.\nThis is not a problem that will ever go away, however, and in addition to safety concerns for riders, cocaine in particular, by its very nature, brings users into close contact with criminals. Vigilance and education may be sufficient for now, but stricter regulation too must always be an option.\nThe Chatteris Fen Juvenile Hurdle at Huntingdon is the feature event on the British programme this afternoon and while Fret D\u2019Estruval (2.30) is a little weak in the market this morning \u2013 out to 9-2 from 11-4 overnight \u2013 he is still worth backing to step up from a very promising first run in Britain in a strong event at Cheltenham last time. In the end, he finished 40 lengths behind the winner Nelson River, but Alan King\u2019s gelding looked likely to take a hand in the finish for much of the way and could be suited by today\u2019s sharper test. Wood Pigeon (2.00) also has an obvious chance on the same card, while Whiteoak Fleur (2.20) and Instant Replay (2.50) both have solid claims up at Sedgefield. Dancing Jo (1.10) and Betancourt (6.45) look best on the cards at Lingfield and Wolverhampton respectively.\u00a0\nHuntingdon: 1.00 Twenty Twenty 1.30 Precious Bounty 2.00 Wood Pigeon (nb) 2.30 Fret D\u2019Estruval (nap) 3.00 Well Smitten 3.30 Etamine Du Cochet\u00a0\nLingfield: 1.10 Dancing Jo 1.40 Delicate Kiss 2.10 Swift Approval 2.40 Ventura Blues 3.10 Minuty 3.40 Mercers\u00a0\nSedgefield: 1.20 Best To Come 1.50 Ringaringarosie 2.20 Whiteoak Fleur 2.50 Instant Replay 3.20 Nortonthorpelegend 3.50 Dares To Dream\u00a0\nWolverhampton: 4.10 Big Bad Lol 4.45 Roman De Brut 5.15 Rock Bottom 5.45 Tabou Beach Boy 6.15 Flaming Marvel 6.45 Betancourt 7.15 Hanati 7.45 Sir Ottoman",

Like Nike, So We Flow\u2019s clothes favour earthy tones, such as \u201colive\u201d and \u201cgrit\u201d.\nBrogawear \u2013 as the yoga branch of sportswear is commonly known \u2013 is also creeping into fashion, designed to be worn on and off the mat. So We Flow combines \u201cthe understated aesthetic of British workwear with a purpose firmly committed to movement and utility\u201d.\nLululemon, the brand best known for its women\u2019s luxury yoga pants, plans to grow its men\u2019s category to a $1bn (\u00a3780bn) business by 2020, and last year revealed men made up 30% of new customers during the first quarter. In the US, men-only \u201cbroga\u201d classes and retreats have also been gaining in popularity.\nWill Wheeler, the founder of Level Six yoga studio in Peckham, south London, said: \u201cWe are definitely seeing an uptick in the number of men joining our classes. There\u2019s a rise in yoga as a stretchy complement to high-intensity workouts. A class can be just as sweaty as gym training.\u201d\nAccording to the founder of Triyoga, Jonathan Sattin, men accounted for 11%\u201327% of class attendees in 2015. By last year, that figure was 25%\u201350%. Yoga has also gained high-profile male advocates: the former footballer Ryan Giggs put the longevity of his career down to practising yoga, while the boxer Anthony Joshua hopes it will do the same for him.\nThe \u201cphysical and mental benefits\u201d of yoga have also been cited by the men\u2019s yoga clothing brand Ohmme. Its yoga vests and dharma pants (soft and loose but with slim-fit ankles) challenge \u201cpreconceived ideas of masculinity\u201d. It is perhaps this that is the driving force behind the male uptake in yoga; after all, a gendered New Year resolution hardly feels very 2019.",

Its vintage periods were in the 1930s, \u201950s and \u201970s when chess legends including almost all the world champions were eager to compete while Sir George Thomas and Hugh Alexander defeated top Russians in stunning upsets.\nTradition continues, with generous backing from Hastings Council and Tradewise Insurance, but the event is now a shadow of its old self. The elite have opted for the much higher prize funds of the London Classic, the World Blitz and Tata Steel Wijk.\nThe Wijk field is headed by the reigning world champion, Magnus Carlsen, who faces a tough round one pairing as Black against Ding Liren. China\u2019s world No 4 recently completed a record 100 games without defeat. Ding v Carlsen will be shown live online (12.30pm start).\nIndian and Chinese grandmasters have been winners at six of the past eight Hastings but in 2018 the large Indian group preferred Stockholm\u2019s Rilton Cup while the Chinese stayed at home. With no clear favourite it proved a low-scoring and open contest which ended with players from six different countries sharing first on 7/10.\nIt was a messy outcome, which should have been replaced by a sole English winner. Danny Gormally was half a point clear at the start of the final round and soon established what looked like a winning endgame. But then his chess demons got to him, he missed clear chances and at the end he had to settle for rook and knight against rook and the large chasing pack took advantage.\nGormally had the best performance rating of the sextet, 2576, so was awarded the Golombek Trophy although the cash prizes were shared. It was a welcome comeback for a player whose career was defined 12 years ago by a highly publicised dance floor incident at the 2006 Turin Olympiad.\nLevon Aronian was the victim, but for the Armenian it brought triumph then and later. He led his team to the gold medals, a small Caucasian nation defeating the big guns, and they were flown back to Erevan in the presidential jet. He is now married to Arianne Caoili, his dance partner in Turin.\nGormally was sent home early and has never played for England since, yet that disaster seemed to spark his talent as an original writer and commentator on the game. Play Chess Like The Pros is a fine instructional book while his personal opinions in articles, videos and interviews are always stimulating.\nThe other significant name in the sextet was Conor Murphy. Irish victories in major tournaments are rare, excepting the annual weekenders in Bunratty and Kilkenny, and it is more than 20 years since Alex Baburin won at Isle of Man 1997 with 8/9.

        "content": "To say French rugby is overdue a renaissance is easier than predicting precisely when it will occur. Last time out in November the national team were beaten at home by Fiji; it is now almost nine years since Les Bleus won a Six Nations title. Since the 2015 Rugby World Cup they have managed only 10 victories in 32 Tests, mostly against lower-ranked opposition, and won away from home twice.\nAside from the exceptional galactico-stuffed Toulon squad between 2013-15, only one other Top 14 side has secured the European Cup in more than two decades. That club is Toulouse, who have lifted it a record four times in their distinguished history. It used to be said that if rugby in the north of England was strong the national team would follow suit. The French barometer is Stade Toulousain which, given they are currently unbeaten in Pool One in Europe, suggests the Gallic mercury may just be rising again.\nWith seven Toulouse players in France\u2019s Six Nations squad this week, this weekend\u2019s game in Leinster will certainly showcase some of the shimmering young talent which could yet transform their country\u2019s fortunes over the next few years.\nBehind the scrum, in particular, there are distinct signs of life, with the alert, strong 22-year-old scrum-half Antoine Dupont and the in-form 23-year-old full-back Thomas Ramos helping to reinvigorate Yoann Huget and Maxime M\u00e9dard. Romain Ntamack, the teenage son of the former French international Emile, and Clermont\u2019s Damian Penaud, son of Alain, are also impressive chips off well-known blocks.\nThe list goes on and on. At 20, huge things are predicted for the precocious prop Demba Bamba, on loan at Brive from Lyon this season and now in the full French squad. Back-rowers Jordan Joseph and Cameron Woki, both members of France\u2019s U20 World Cup winning team last June, are similarly highly rated and the gifted 20-year-old Bordeaux fly-half Matthieu Jalibert is already a full international. The rangy Stade Francais flanker Sekou Macalou, 23, is another with massive athletic talent and a big engine.\nAmong those who reckon the French may just have a golden generation on their hands is Toby Flood, now back at Newcastle after an instructive spell at Toulouse. \u201cI do think there is a new generation coming,\u201d says Flood. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a wealth of talent now. The argument always used to be that foreigners in the Top 14 were stopping the talent coming through. Well, not if that talent\u2019s good enough. I think there\u2019s a good group now who have the chance to go out and play and that\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\nOne look at the highlight reels of Dupont, Penaud, Bamba and the rest is to reinforce Flood\u2019s message. Bamba is a tight-head prop with the mobility and stepping ability of a centre. Penaud, strong and quick, has been taken under the wing of Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie at Clermont and is being tipped to start on the wing for France in the Six Nations. No less a judge than the former All Black Jerome Kaino, meanwhile, reckons Dupont offers a different dimension to the slightly-built distributors latterly favoured by Les Bleus. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenon, he\u2019s as fit as a bull,\u201d suggested Kaino. \u201cHe needs to look around him a bit more, to take his time a bit more, but he\u2019s a super youngster.\u201d\nFlood is also interesting on the subject of Ramos, who wears the 10 jersey this weekend and is currently the tournament\u2019s leading scorer with 51 points from four games. \u201cWhen I was at Toulouse, Thomas was sent out on loan to Colomiers and was exceptional for them: scoring tries, kicking everything. That game time has done him a lot of favours and given him a huge amount of confidence. He\u2019s not big and he\u2019s only fairly strong in the gym but he\u2019s probably been the best player for Toulouse for the last 18 months in terms of what he\u2019s given the side: his kicking and how he understands and plays the game.\u201d\nWith the South African Cheslin Kolbe also in electric form and Ntamack adept at picking smart supporting lines, Flood suspects Leinster, minus their captain Johnny Sexton who has a slight calf strain, will have their hands full if Toulouse win some ball. \u201cI just think it\u2019s going to be really interesting. Leinster have their structures in place and possess talent within those structures but they\u2019ll be up against a team who are a bit off the cuff and will do some random stuff. In the last couple of years confidence was low and the ball wouldn\u2019t stick. Maybe there wasn\u2019t the old spring in the step of some of their more seasoned players.\u201d\nAmong the catalysts has been Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud, the club\u2019s legendary full-back now back as a mentor to its younger players following a stint in South Africa. \u201cSpeak to anybody there and they will tell you how important Cl\u00e9ment has been,\u201d reveals Flood. \u201cI think he has had a huge impact on how they play. He\u2019s just stripped it all back and done basic stuff with them: catch-pass, catch-pass. When I was there things were a bit hazy, no one was quite sure because we weren\u2019t quite getting the guidance.\u201d\nHistory would strongly advise against getting too excited. France\u2019s best days used to involve forwards whose programme mugshots resembled Interpol\u2019s most-wanted list; until they can exert proper set-piece dominance at the top level and maintain it for 80 minutes Les Bleus will not be hoisting much silverware. That said, they are perhaps the country with the capacity to improve most between now and the World Cup in Japan. And who happens to be sharing their RWC pool? Flood, for one, reckons England should be wary.\n\u201cEngland should beat France nine times out of 10 on current form but going into the World Cup there will be a few young French guys who have had not had those experiences before, who don\u2019t feel defeat is looming when they go a few points down. There should be a big fear factor there for other teams in the pool.\u201d\nIn Europe this season, certainly, no one has performed with more elan than Toulouse and Racing 92. Should the former score a double over Leinster, having already beaten them 28-27 in October, it will extend their unbeaten run to an eye-catching 10 games. Nothing is ever certain in French rugby but, not before time, the cockerel is starting to crow again.",

It also explains that music-making initiatives are often impossible to implement because of the cost.\nSome years ago, when I first had experience of family members in care, I realised that live music was a nice thing for dementia patients. As I am a professional pianist, I volunteered to go and play concerts of light and \u201cvintage\u201d piano music in care homes and hospitals. I did a supervised trial event in a long-stay unit, which seemed to show that residents would enjoy more of it.\nUltimately, \u201cmore\u201d never happened because I was told I\u2019d have to submit to background checks, agree never to be on my own on the premises with any resident, arrange to be escorted through the grounds each time I came, and so on. I know such rules are put in place for good reason, but they were sufficiently intrusive that my enthusiasm ebbed away, and in the end I withdrew my offer, feeling it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. There must, however, be many musicians like me who would be glad to offer their skills free of charge to dementia homes if there were a simple way of doing so.Susan TomesEdinburgh\n Your article on dementia care exposes the flawed model of social prescribing being adopted by parts of the NHS.

Who will these link workers be referring the 900,000 people to? The care homes charging \u00a330 per person? Creating a social prescribing industry will indeed come at a price \u2013 but it won\u2019t support the growth of health-creating communities that, at a lower cost, can sustain music, dance and a host of other healthy living activities that are truly person-centred and far more likely to achieve the goals set out in the NHS\u2019s long-term plan.

I am the former head of policy in the Prison Service, and was involved in the creation of the sentence.\nIPP was the invention of David Blunkett in 2001, against the advice of officials. He rejected the scheme for violent or sexual offenders proposed in a Home Office review of sentencing (Making Punishments Work), namely a determinate sentence with a review of the release date by the Parole Board, and a supervisory period that could be extended by the court.\nInstead he mandated the IPP and it was applied precisely as intended and as set down in statute, with all the consequences that officials pointed out at the time. Most importantly, its application was mandatory upon the courts on a second conviction for a sexual or violent offence, however minor the actual behaviour. One of its first uses was where a man had squeezed a woman\u2019s breast at a bus stop, and had a previous similar conviction: the court was obliged to impose an IPP. All the problems that have come to pass were glaringly apparent in that conviction.Nicolas SandersonLondon\n The mental anguish inflicted on nearly 2,600 people serving the discredited and now abolished IPP is indicated in the shocking self-harm rates for this group. IPP prisoners are more than twice as likely to self-harm as people serving determinate sentences, with 872 incidents of self-harm per 1,000 IPP prisoners \u2013 a rate that has more than doubled over the past five years. In advice to ministers published in 2016, the Parole Board set out policy options for expediting the release of the remaining IPP population, as well as dealing with the growing problem of IPP recalls.\nWithout further legislation the board estimated that more than 1,000 IPP prisoners will remain stuck in the system by 2020, eight years after the sentence was abolished. Proposals for reform include conversion of IPP sentences into their equivalent determinate sentence, which could start with those on the shortest tariffs who have experienced the greatest injustice, and improvements to the licence conditions and support available to IPP prisoners on release. The government should finish the job it started and eradicate a stain on our justice system once and for all.Mark DayHead of policy and communications, Prison Reform Trust\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Unless the basic structure of housing provision in the UK is changed to restore to local authorities powers of compulsory purchase, with taxation on the land-value enhancement, this will be the unintended consequence.\nThe result of right-to-buy has been the sell-off of 60,000 council homes with a \u00a33.5bn public subsidy, and 40% of that stock finding its way into the hands of private landlords, who rent it back, often to the same local authority at hugely inflated rates. A straight transfer of public wealth into private hands.\nHave the report\u2019s authors studied the 2016 research that showed unimplemented planning consents for nearly half a million homes in England and Wales? Or that in the same year, according to government data analysed by the online estate agent HouseSimple, the number of empty homes in England rose for the first time in a decade to 205,293, representing \u00a350bn worth of vacant property stock?\nResearch shows that there is little evidence of a shortfall in the housing stock. The crisis we suffer from is largely the result of acute maldistribution within an economic structure which encourages maximum consumption of a scarce resource by those with the means to command the market, at the expense of the many with little or no access to capital. Land value taxation is one mechanism which would very swiftly and relatively painlessly provide a counterbalance to this vicious cycle of ever increasing disparity of wealth distribution. The Housing And Planning Act should be rescinded, restoring security of tenure to existing tenants.\nThe equalisation of VAT on refurbishment with the current zero rate for new housebuilding would remove a 20% incentive to demolish and redevelop. With a level playing field, an objective cost comparison could be made between proper maintenance and redevelopment, with all the social cost the latter involves.Kate MacintoshWinchester, Hampshire\n Before we start spending a projected \u00a3225bn on concreting over huge tracts of increasingly precious green space, how about doing more with the existing housing stock? Rent control, much longer tenancies with, obviously, an end to no-fault evictions, penal taxation of property left empty, and the compulsory purchase and improvement \u2013 or redevelopment \u2013 of substandard rental accommodation, and thus its conversion to social housing, would collectively be quicker and cheaper. Sure, all of that would soften prices, but the issue is homes, not investments, and spending power released by lower housing costs \u2013 both personal discretionary and for government in housing benefit savings \u2013 would flow into the wider economy.John WorrallCromer, Norfolk\n This report is good news. But there is also an urgent need to overhaul the standard approach to the design and governance of low-cost housing so it accommodates home-based work. This is often restricted or even prohibited in social housing, which is generally currently designed to models developed in the early 20th century specifically to prevent this working practice. This is short-sighted and discriminatory \u2013 social tenants have as much right to work from home as anyone else.Frances HollissEmeritus reader in architecture, London Metropolitan University\n The current social housing crisis is an artificially created problem begun by the political dogma in the 1980 Housing Act and developed into a crisis by the political ineptitude and inertia of governments of every colour over the four decades since.\nFor almost the whole of that period house prices have gone up faster than wages. It takes a bear of very little brain to realise that sooner or later both house purchase and rental become unaffordable, which is, of course, exactly what has happened.\nThe good news is that because it is an artificially created problem, we have the ability to solve it. However, the cost has been estimated to be as much as four HS2s, while the net cost might be less than one. This sounds like a rather good deal to me, since failure to get to grips with it is going to tear at the heart of our society over the next decades.Robin HowellBridgwater, Somerset\n The shortage of social housing is yet another example of the failure of so-called \u201cfree market\u201d capitalism to provide even for our basic needs. The current housebuilding programme is fuelled by the needs of builders and developers to make a profit rather than by the needs of those trying to reach the bottom of the housing ladder. With larger family houses providing a bigger return on capital, developers are finding ways to bypass government legislation requiring them to provide \u201caffordable\u201d housing in any development.\nNot only do smaller \u201caffordable\u201d houses give those starting out a chance to own their own home but they could also usefully be occupied by older people who are finding their larger family home difficult and expensive to run and too big for their needs. A huge cause of the housing shortage \u2013 never mentioned \u2013 is the fact that as we are living longer we very often continue to occupy the family home even when it becomes too big for us. The suggestion isn\u2019t that older people should be forced into moving, of course, but with the availability of smaller accommodation in the same area, and with possible tax incentives, many a family house could become available for a family. If the housing needs of the population took priority over the return on capital for builders and developers, the housing problem would be solved.Eileen PeckBenfleet, Essex\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Parliament may have broken with tradition to sit on a Friday to debate the EU withdrawal bill but MPs weren\u2019t going to let that spoil their weekend. Brexit, what Brexit? The Commons chamber was more like an echo chamber. You get a bigger crowd for an adjournment debate on the illegal trade of seahorses.\nSajid Javid certainly didn\u2019t look best pleased to be called upon to resume the debate. The Sajid has his eyes on becoming prime minister one day in the not too distant future, and an early morning, end-of-the pier gig in front of a barely conscious audience of a few dozen had not been part of his planned career trajectory. He should have been doing stadium tours by now.\nThe home secretary languidly uncoiled himself to take his place at the despatch box. If no one else was going to make an effort, then why should he? So rather than deliver a new speech, making the case for accepting Theresa May\u2019s deal, he chose instead to go through the motions by making much the same one he had given when announcing the government\u2019s immigration policy several weeks previously. Only he managed to do it worse. An achievement of sorts. When he comes to look back on today, The Saj will be grateful so few MPs were there to witness his performance.\nMost people had voted to leave the EU because they wanted more control over immigration, he began, apparently unaware that many Conservatives who were backing the prime minister\u2019s deal had argued the exact opposite the previous day. Luckily they weren\u2019t in the chamber to correct him.\nThe country needed a policy that would simultaneously ban and welcome immigration, he declared. Not for the first time, Schrodinger\u2019s Brexit was being presented as credible government policy. The Saj was going to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands by not allowing anyone into the country who earned less than about \u00a330,000 but would still keep the NHS and the hospitality and agriculture sectors running by letting people in who earned considerably less. Suck on that.\nWhat made this still more depressing was that The Saj clearly knew he was talking bollocks but didn\u2019t much care one way or the other. And nor did anyone else. We have reached the point where no one really expects a minister to be coherent about Brexit any more. Minds have long since been made up and MPs are at liberty to construct their own alternative realities.\nDiane Abbott being a prime example. Her reply was a classic of the genre. First she appeared to have printed out her speech in the wrong order, frequently ignoring huge chunks of text by turning over several pages at a time. Perhaps the early start had also caught her on the hop. Or maybe she had decided that, on reflection, she too was a bit bored with talking about Brexit.\nThen she went full Ukip by citing an intelligence report by former MI6 and defence chiefs that had ended with the suggestion the UK would be better off leaving the EU with no deal. It was almost as if she had no idea of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. There again, few people do.\nThe most heartfelt speech was made by the Conservative Nicholas Soames, who has spent the past 35 years trying to channel the ghost of his grandfather, Winston Churchill. Only without ever achieving quite the passion or the plausibility. Soames insisted the public wouldn\u2019t forgive the Commons for any delay \u2013 one wonders what he imagines May has been doing all this time \u2013 and that a vote against the deal would be a vote for chaos. Because everything was going so smoothly now \u2026\nThereafter it was a matter of MPs using the time to wind down the clock with their favourite Brexit soundbites. The war. Maastricht. Vassal state. The war. Second referendum. Few people bothered to interrupt, mostly because no one was listening. This wasn\u2019t a debate so much as a procedural formality. The Commons had promised it would fill the time and that was one promise everyone would keep.\nNor did the closing speeches offer any enlightenment. Because there had been so few Labour MPs in the house, Emily Thornberry was able to name-check each and every one of them without ever giving any real indication she was entirely sure she knew why she was there. She could have sworn she was meant to have been at lunch. In reply, Jeremy Hunt kept things short and sweet. The bad deal was the best deal because it was the only deal. The government had been consistent on this. Consistently inconsistent. Would that do? Under the circumstances, it would.",

        "content": "Martin Fayulu\u2019s campaign team says he won 60% of vote, fuelling febrile atmosphere as police and soldiers deployed across country\nThe runner-up in Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s presidential election says he in fact won the vote by a landslide, as rising violence across the country fuels fears of a wider law and order breakdown.\nMartin Fayulu\u2019s campaign team claimed it had evidence its candidate had scored more than 60% of the votes in the much-delayed election on 30 December, 42 points more than F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, who was declared the winner by the electoral commission early on Thursday.\nIn a speech to hundreds of supporters who gathered in the capital, Kinshasa, on Friday, Fayulu denounced what he called the \u201cpeople\u2019s stolen victory\u201d and said he would file a challenge to the official results at the constitutional court on Saturday morning.\nFayulu\u2019s figures are understood to be close to those compiled by the influential Catholic church, which deployed 40,000 observers on the day of the election.\nThe church has refused to reveal who won according to its findings, but diplomats briefed on the church data say it indicated a clear victory for Fayulu, in line with pre-election polls that had put him at least 20 points ahead of Tshisekedi.\nThe Fayulu camp figures are also very similar to those cited in hundreds of pages of documents leaked by a whistleblower and passed to the Guardian overnight on Thursday. The documents, which the Guardian has been unable to verify independently, are purported to be the electoral commission\u2019s authentic count.\nAn electoral commission spokesperson denied that there was any difference between the officially published results \u2013 which gave Tshisekedi 38%, four points ahead of Fayulu \u2013 and any other figures compiled by the body. Experts said the results in the leaked documents were \u201cplausible in parts\u201d but expressed scepticism about the claimed margin of Fayulu\u2019s apparent win and the turnout figures cited.\nAt least nine people have been killed and many more injured since the announcement of the result on Thursday. Five police stations have been attacked and scores of protesters arrested in a series of clashes with security agencies. A prison breakout and a massacre by a militia have further intensified security concerns across the vast, strategically crucial central African state.\nMost of the demonstrations have involved supporters of Fayulu, a former business executive, who immediately rejected the official results on Thursday, accusing Tshisekedi of doing a deal with outgoing president Joseph Kabila and calling for a campaign to resist what he called \u201can electoral coup\u201d.\nIn comments to the UN security council via video link on Friday, the president of the electoral commission defended the vote\u2019s credibility and attacked the church. \u201cI\u2019d be very interested to know what party they work for,\u201d said Corneille Nangaa. \u201cI challenge anyone to say they have the pretension to have collected all the vote tallies.\u201d\nThe CENCO group of Catholic bishops told the security council it was independent and said the electoral commission should release its records to allow for verification and \u201cdispel doubt among the population\u201d.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo's sheer size, its political history and its myriad problems are all reasons why observers have followed its election so closely.\nThe vast, resource-rich country, with a population of 80 million spread over an area the size of western Europe, has never known a peaceful transition of power since its independence from Belgium in 1960.\nIt remains one of the poorest places in the world, racked by war and disease and with massive inequality. In the east, where scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines, an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. Countrywide an estimated 4.3 million people are displaced.\u00a0\nIt is still recovering from a civil war triggered by the fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, in which 4 million people died. Joseph Kabila has been in power as president since his father, Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.\nThe country\u2019s problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago, which is why December\u2019s much-delayed election was invested with so much hope and trepidation.\u00a0\u00a0\nChaos at polling stations on the day of the vote dampened hopes that the election would bring a measure of political stability.\u00a0 The announcement by the electoral commission on 10 January that Felix Tshisekedi had won confounded polling that had put another opposition figure well in front and raised fears of a backroom deal ultimately keeping Kabila in power.\nFayulu\u2019s claim of substantial victory will fuel a febrile atmosphere that threatens to tip DRC into a cycle of protest, violent repression and worsening insecurity \u2013 dashing hopes that the election would mark a turning point in the country\u2019s troubled history. Polls in 2006 and 2011 \u2013 both won by Kabila \u2013 saw significant bloodshed.\nReports compiled by international NGOs and embassies seen by the Guardian reveal the extent of growing violence. Thousands of police and soldiers from the regular army as well as the feared republican guard, an elite unit loyal to Kabila, were deployed across the country as protests broke out.\nIn Kikwit, the capital of Kwilu, between three and six civilians were killed and two police officers badly beaten as soldiers used live firing to clear unidentified youths who had erected barricades on Thursday evening. Aid workers described the situation on Friday as very tense, with shots heard in several locations. Several arrests were made by police, including a journalist who was later released.\nThere are also reports of a prison breakout in the town, during which 90 convicts escaped and five were shot dead. Much of the prison was reportedly destroyed.\nIn Mbandaka, a port town on the Congo river in the centre of the country, there were protests on Friday morning after the overnight deaths of two civilians, one a woman allegedly killed by a soldier. Soldiers were reported to have fired into the air to clear the crowds and a senior local leader of Fayulu\u2019s coalition was arrested after calling for protests on a radio station.\nIn the major town of Kisangani, police and soldiers stormed the campus of the university and makeshift road blocks in the Makiso neighbourhood to control a \u201cmassive and violent situation\u201d with sporadic shooting, according to aid workers. The local offices of the main ruling party were burned and a drinking club belonging to the town governor was looted. Local reports described calm on Friday but nervous inhabitants were said to be withdrawing money from banks.\nReinforcing fears of a more general breakdown of security, the bodies of seven civilians were discovered on Thursday morning in North Kivu, a restive eastern province. The find brings the death toll from a suspected militia attack earlier this week to 18, one of the most deadly for months, diplomatic sources told the Guardian.\nTshisekedi\u2019s apparent victory surprised some observers who believed authorities would ensure victory for the government candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who was handpicked by Kabila as his successor.\nKabila, has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the long-serving dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.",

It\u2019s lovely to be here.\u201d And with that, and a knowing smile to the camera, Fiona Bruce swept away 25 years of David Dimbleby\u2019s Question Time and claimed the nation\u2019s highest-profile political programme absolutely as her own.\nBruce had confessed to feeling uncharacteristically apprehensive before her debut on the BBC One programme on Thursday night, chairing a panel that comprised the Conservative deputy chairman, James Cleverly, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, columnist Melanie Phillips, comedian Nish Kumar and Jo Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats.\nBut she gave no hint of nerves during a performance that won widespread praise for her \u201cmillpond calm\u201d but \u201cfocused, thorough, journalistic approach\u201d (The Times) and \u201ccalmness, clarity and dry wit\u201d (Daily Telegraph).\nOn social media, too, there was widespread appreciation. \u201cOoh ... I like her. She\u2019s keeping them on track to answer,\u201d tweeted businesswoman Deborah Meaden. \u201cFiona Bruce is doing an amazing job on Question Time, bravo,\u201d said Jonathan Ross. And from the actor Sanjeev Kohli: \u201cFiona Bruce REALLY needs to bring this fire & sarcasm to the owners of antique forks. Outstanding performance.\u201d\nThere were sharp interventions (telling Thornberry the audience were laughing at her as she outlined Labour policy) and quotable quotes (to Cleverly: \u201cIf this is the government being in control, what does out of control look like?\u201d) and even a viral-worthy hashtag when Twitter users responded enthusiastically to a #ladyinyellow outlining why she did not feel sorry for Theresa May.\nA sigh of relief, then, for BBC bosses: the safe hands Bruce brings to the dusty relics featured on Antiques Roadshow had proved no less assured when handling this particular national treasure.\nThe view was shared by Caroline Lucas MP, who was a guest on Dimbleby\u2019s final episode in December and knows well the lurching feeling as the opening credits roll (\u201cIt\u2019s when you hear the music. It\u2019s the most terrifying thing you ever do, and many politicians will say the same thing\u201d).\n\u201cWhat I liked about Fiona Bruce was that she had a quiet authority,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cShe was able to keep order and assert herself as necessary, but she did it in quite a light-touch way. She wasn\u2019t letting anyone get away with anything, but it didn\u2019t feel obtrusive, it was just helpful. Politicians, when they go on that programme, need to be held to account, and I think she did it very well.\u201d\nWas it significant that Bruce is the first female presenter in 40 years? \u201cThese panel programmes where women in the past have been marginalised, it\u2019s so good to see a majority of women and a female chair. But I don\u2019t think there was anything gender specific about the way she was conducting it.\u201d\nAyesha Hazarika, a political commentator and former Labour advisor who has appeared on the programme twice, felt Bruce\u2019s quietly cool manner had brought a different tone to the show. \u201cShe was much more of an active chair than there has been in the past. I think there has been a tendency a little bit to let people scrap and shout over each other.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was because it was the first one, but I thought everybody just behaved a bit better; she didn\u2019t let people get away with the normal shenanigans where the strongest voice and the most confident person can trot out soundbite after soundbite.\u201d\nFor a programme that pulls in around 2 million viewers and finishes close to midnight, Question Time retains a curious place in the national consciousness \u2013 disliked by many as an angry bear pit, but still, even after almost 1,400 editions, appointment-to-view television for many. \u201cIt\u2019s a programme people love to hate, don\u2019t they?\u201d says Lucas. \u201cEven the people who hate it watch it so they can say they hate it.\u201d\nIt is also one of the few occasions where ordinary people can regularly challenge those in power on their performance, \u201cand surely our goal should be to make that normal again,\u201d notes Polly Mackenzie, the chief executive of the thinktank Demos, who has also appeared on the panel. \u201cI like Question Time. If it was the sum total of all political accountability in our national life, it would obviously be a disaster, but it\u2019s just a show.\u201d\nAs for having a woman in charge after four decades, \u201cit\u2019s great,\u201d says Mackenzie. \u201cBut what would be really brilliant would be for it to be unremarkable.\u201d",

        "content": "It is almost 14 years since Andy Murray\u2019s grand slam career began against George Bastl on Wimbledon\u2019s old No 2 Court, known as the graveyard of champions. Soon, following all the tears and tributes, the glorious career of Britain\u2019s greatest tennis player will also be laid to rest and he will have to work out what to do next. Pundit? Commentator? Tech investor? Perhaps even politician?\nMark Borkowski, a PR expert who has worked with Michael Jackson, Van Morrison and a host of other stars and brands, believes Murray\u2019s options are vast. \u201cThere is almost nothing he couldn\u2019t do next,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat we look for in PR these days is authenticity and raw emotion, and Murray has got that in droves. Sponsors will be salivating at having him because he is so open and honest and because he is an inspiration to so many people.\u201d\nFor more than a decade Murray had a preternatural desire to be the best player in the world. Then, after his hip injury in 2017, his drive switched to returning to the sport he loves. A big issue will be how he copes with losing his primary reason to get up in the morning.\nAndr\u00e9 Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School, says: \u201cDuring their successful years, sports stars invest heavily in their identity as high performers and often neglect other sides of themselves. That means when they quit they have no other identity to fall back on.\u201d\nThat cannot be said about Murray. There has long been the sense that he has been anticipating a second career, away from the courts and sweaty locker rooms.\nIn 2013 he set up his sports management consultancy 77 with his business advisers Matt Gentry and Gawain Davies. Among others, he represents and mentors the teenagers Aidan McHugh and Katie Swan who are tipped to be the next generation of British tennis talent.\nMurray also has a keen interest in technology and in 2015 partnered with crowdfunding platform Seedrs. Last year he told Forbes that he has stakes in more than 30 ventures, the latest of which is Deuce, a mobile app that helps tennis players find courts and coaching sessions around the UK, making it easier and more affordable to find a game.\nAn obvious next step would be to step in front of the camera, following in the footsteps of Tim Henman and Gary Lineker. Murray certainly looked a natural as a pundit during last year\u2019s Wimbledon, not only forthright and wise but witty with it. He also excelled as a co-commentator during Rafael Nadal\u2019s epic quarter-final with Juan Mart\u00edn del Petro, although few would have watched it given England were playing Croatia in a World Cup semi-final at the same time.\nThere is certainly scope for Murray to be tennis\u2019s answer to Gary Neville, although he has no great desire to be in front of the camera and is likely to dip in and out rather than make it a full-time job.\nWhatever happens next Murray\u2019s finances are rosy. According to Forbes magazine, he will finish his career with at least \u00a3128m in career earnings, including \u00a348m in prize money and nearly \u00a380m in earnings from appearance fees, bonuses and endorsements from blue-chip companies such as Under Armour, Head and Jaguar.\nWhile those numbers will obviously take a hit, retirement does not always mean a steep loss of earnings. The heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill, for instance, made \u00a34.2m in 2017 \u2013 a year after she retired \u2013 compared to \u00a33.5m in 2016 when she won an Olympic silver medal.\nIt would be no surprise to see Murray occasionally get involved in sports politics. Given his dedication to Team GB it is understood that the British Olympic Association is keen to formally harness his ambassadorial support since it has seen at first-hand his ability to inspire athletes and the public.\nBorkowski, meanwhile, believes that Murray would be a natural politician. The fact he is a three-times winner of the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year Award also shows he has plenty of support among the public.\n\u201cMurray is accessible, is a vigorous supporter of women\u2019s rights and has a dry sense of humour so I could certainly see him as politician,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe fact that he is a little unpolished \u2013 and he says things as they are \u2013 is no bad thing either.\u201d\nLong before then there is likely to be a trip to Buckingham Palace to have his OBE formally upgraded to the knighthood that was bestowed on him two years ago. And in the coming years it would be no surprise if he replaced Leon Smith as Great Britain\u2019s Davis Cup captain. But whatever happens next, Murray will remain a compelling, and vital, figure in the British sporting landscape.",

Ford refused to confirm the figures and said it was consulting with unions.\nBritain\u2019s largest trade union, Unite, vowed to fight against any compulsory redundancies. \u201cIt is a devastating blow for our members and their families, as well as having grave implications for the Welsh economy and the supply chain,\u201d said Des Quinn, Unite\u2019s national officer for the automotive industry.\n\u201cThere are a number of factors behind this grim news \u2013 the main ones being challenging market conditions for carmakers generally, a lack of a coherent industrial strategy from the UK government and the uncertainty created by Brexit.\n\u201cOver the last two decades the UK car industry has experienced a renaissance of which we can all be proud of.\n\u201cThe challenge for government, the carmakers and the unions in the near future is to fight very hard to maintain the environment that made that success possible,\u201d Quinn said.\nJo Stevens, the Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said Ford\u2019s decision was \u201cawful news for Bridgend and the whole of south Wales\u201d.\nFord is overhauling its European operations in an attempt to increase profit margins, including the shutting down of loss-making vehicle lines.\nIt is to abandon the multivan market \u2013 vehicles with more than five seats \u2013 stop manufacturing automatic transmissions in Bordeaux from August, review its operations in Russia and combine the headquarters of Ford UK and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex.\n\u201cWe are taking decisive action to transform the Ford business in Europe,\u201d said Steven Armstrong, Ford\u2019s group vice-president and president of its Europe, Middle East and Africa region.\n\u201cWe will invest in the vehicles, services, segments and markets that best support a long-term sustainably profitable business, creating value for all our stakeholders and delivering emotive vehicles to our customers.\u201d\nDetails of large-scale job cuts at Ford follow hard on the heels of Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s announcement that it plans to reduce its workforce by 4,500, the majority via voluntary redundancies in UK management roles at sites including Coventry and Gaydon in Warwickshire.\nJLR has suffered because of falling Chinese demand and a fall-off in diesel sales after the Dieselgate emissions-testing scandal, which has led several cities and countries to impose punitive taxes on cars powered by the fuel.\nFord and JLR have also warned that the longer-term future for the British car industry remains uncertain because of Brexit. The Japanese carmaker Honda said on Thursday that it would shut down its Swindon factory for six days in April, following the planned Brexit departure date on 29 March.",

        "content": "Widely loved and politically progressive, the Scot will retire as arguably the greatest individual British sports person of the modern age\nStop all the green and yellow Timex clocks. Put away that union jack tea towel. Stow the Pimms-sodden crash barriers at the foot of the Aorangi Terrace.\nAndy Murray may yet play another Wimbledon this summer, depending on the state of his chronic, career-capping hip injury. But in the wake of a raw and tearful press conference on Friday morning it seems highly likely that next week\u2019s Australian Open will be the final appearance of a stellar, transformative, broadly-sketched tennis career.\nAt the end of which Murray will retire as arguably the greatest individual British sports person of the modern age. Not to mention, in a surprising twist given his awkward, un-fluffy adolescence, perhaps the most widely loved, most uplifting and, in men\u2019s sport at least, most politically progressive too.\nAs Murray is universally garlanded over the coming days there will no doubt be a wry smile or two among hardened tennis hacks who were there at the start of the Murray Supremacy, as an 18-year-old Wimbledon wild card back in 2005. The embryonic Murray was all talent, all potential; but somehow not quite cut from the same physical stuff as your average steamrollering alpha athlete.\nFor one thing Murray was rake-thin and slouchy, a gangly kid next to the slabbed and ripped power-players of the modern men\u2019s game. For another he was funny and acerbic, with the kind of prickly, questing intelligence that doesn\u2019t often go hand in hand with a tennis childhood spent racking up a million drive-volley practice repetitions.\nPlus, of course he was British. And ever since the first great Summer of Tim, start of that annual emotional incontinence around the the inevitable collapse of Tim Henman in the late stages of Wimbledon, British tennis had wallowed in its status as an oddly comforting vale of summer tears, a lucrative tableau of almost-but-not-quite home county heroism.\nOne of the best things about Murray is that he ripped all that up. The 2013 men\u2019s Wimbledon singles title will remain his defining achievement. Forget the surrounding noise. Forget about being a nice guy, or the perfect example of how to wring every final drop of sweetness from whatever talent your genes have given you. Winning that title, 77 years on from the last British champion and at a time when three of the greatest tennis players ever were also operating, remains a genuinely vertiginous sporting achievement.\nIn the moment of victory Murray dropped his racket and yelled, mouth agape, into the nearest face in the crowd before crumpling on to the sun-bleached grass. If he was overcome, briefly, then this was understandable given the many layers of skin shed along the way, the ascetic, violently punishing nature of his journey to that moment, the end point of which sees him needing surgery on his hip just to regain the ability to walk without serious pain.\nAlso fitting was the grimly fascinating collection of VIPs there, among them David Cameron, Ed Miliband and, of course, Alex Salmond, waving a vast Scottish saltire just behind the royal party. Even this seems decidedly Murray. If there is a defining note to his elite career it is the constant battle to find his own way through the disorientating gravity around him, remaining throughout decisively and productively himself.\nThe single-mindedness is there even in his quietly unyielding advocacy for equality of the sexes in sport. Murray didn\u2019t appoint Amelie Mauresmo, the first high-profile female coach in any major global male sport, to garner approval points. He did it because she was the best person available. He didn\u2019t publicly defend Mauresmo\u2019s appointment out of a desire to make her gender an issue: he defended her because lazy thinking, prejudice, and judging on anything other than merit is something he finds entirely illegal and counterproductive.\nEven in the moments after he\u2019d lost to Sam Querrey at Wimbledon in 2017, a significant staging post in his own grand slam career, he couldn\u2019t help coming back to this. As an American journalist gushingly congratulated Querrey on his status as \u201cthe first American player\u201d to reach a Wimbledon semi-final in eight years, Murray could be heard interjecting, deadpan, not once but twice with the words \u201cmale player\u201d.\nThis isn\u2019t virtue signalling: it\u2019s accuracy signalling, human merit-signalling. Murray loves and venerates the great players of his time, from Roger to Serena to Novak to Venus, sees only talent and character and human meritocracy. So often during his years at the top his deeds and words have made feminism in sport look less like an ideological choice, more like the only logical position of anyone with half a brain and a shot of basic integrity.\nMurray applied this same emotional honesty to the single biggest challenge of his sporting life. To win Wimbledon as a Brit, and beyond that a Scot, is not simply to win a prestigious tennis tournament. It is to slay an entire circling chorus of invisible dragons. Winning Wimbledon required Murray to meet the weight of those swirling expectations, but also to present himself to that green and yellow arena in a way that retained his own equilibrium, to find just the right emotional pitch.\nThere has always been an echo of the Jane Austen hero about this, about smouldering Mr Murray\u2019s need to balance a tension around his own desire for victory, and Wimbledon\u2019s own needy emotional hauteur. Something of the Wimbledon atmosphere still speaks to class and privilege and sex too, a sport whose rhythms and texture were born out of flannel-trousered country house filtration, something that perhaps explains why so many members of the crowd spend most of their time there tittering and giggling.\nFor a while there was talk of Murray\u2019s emotional frigidity, the need to shed his Celtic chill and embrace a more unbound engagement with that flushed and draining centre court crowd.\nBut forbidding Mr Murray did seduce the crowd, turning its strange, distracting energy to his own ends. His Mr Darcy in the duckpond moment came the year before he finally won it. There was some surprise when Murray burst into tears at the end of his 2012 defeat to Roger Federer. But Murray came back the next year leaner and more shark-like and looking utterly relaxed. Oddly enough, as he lifted the trophy in 2013 it was not Murray but members of the crowd in front of him who burst into tears.\nHe may or may not be back at Wimbledon this summer. No doubt he would love to return. But those who know will tell you he probably preferred New York. What happens in the post-Murray void will be fascinating to see. Wimbledon\u2019s own surging profits have been been built on a recent lineage of A-list British tennis stars, from Tim to Andy.\nBut this is far from the most significant hole Murray leaves, as he will most likely next week. He would depart a three-time Grand Slam winner, 14th on the all-time tournament list, perhaps the greatest British athlete of his time; above all a startlingly fond, likeable presence; and that rare thing, a genuine sporting grownup.",

It might take three months for things to settle down [after Brexit]. The second biggest time for buying toys is Easter.\u201d\nGrant said The Entertainer had not had to take on extra warehouse space to store the toys as it had spare capacity after Christmas.\nHe said The Entertainer had shipped own-label items early but expected toy-makers with European distribution centres such as Lego or Playmobil to present their own plans to ensure supply.\nSimilar tactics have been adopted by a number of British manufacturers, food processors and retailers including Tesco and Marks & Spencer \u2013 which said they were stockpiling tinned and packaged foods \u2013 folding bike-maker Brompton, carmaker Bentley, pharmaceutical firms such as Sanofi and off-licence Majestic Wine.\nCompanies are concerned that lorries will face major delays at ports by even minor changes in bureaucracy related to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, where there is currently a free flow of goods across UK borders with minimal checks.\nWhile goods coming from the far east will not face changes to paperwork, the fear is they will get stuck behind European goods on the last leg of their journey.\nThe Metropolitan police has been suggesting retailers hire additional security to cope with queues of shoppers trying to stockpile goods if concerns about shortages ramp up ahead of March.\nThe challenges around Brexit are piling pressure on retailers during an already difficult period as they try to adapt to a shift to online shopping, rising costs and low consumer confidence.\nEarlier this week, Sainsbury\u2019s, the owner of the UK\u2019s biggest toy retailer Argos, said its toy sales had fallen as the market had shrunk by more than 10%.\nBut Grant said The Entertainer had enjoyed a strong Christmas, with sales up by more than 10% as it had benefited from the demise of Toys R Us last February. \u201cDuring 2018, we opened 16 new stores and we traded better than double digits up,\u201d Grant said.\nHe said sales had risen in established stores and online thanks to the popularity of trends including L.O.L dolls and slime. \u201cWe have had a shiningly good year. We believe in the high street and the high street is nowhere near dead. Our market share is growing and going into 2019 we are as optimistic as we can be with Brexit looming.\u201d",

The England youth international is understood to be determined to leave Stamford Bridge, with a decision expected to be taken following Saturday\u2019s game with Newcastle.\nBut Sarri, who also admitted the \u00a358m \u00c1lvaro Morata could leave on loan this month, could not hide his anger after Bayern\u2019s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, said on Wednesday that Hudson-Odoi \u201cis a very interesting player whom we really want to sign\u201d.\nSarri said: \u201cI think it\u2019s not professional, because they are talking about a player under contract with Chelsea. So they didn\u2019t respect our club.\u201d\nHudson-Odoi has started the last two matches in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup and is expected to be involved against Newcastle despite the uncertainty over his future. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho, who played with him at England under-17 level and remains a close friend, revealed on Thursday he had spoken to Hudson-Odoi and \u201ctold him the Bundesliga is a nice league. I just told him to do whatever is best for him and whatever makes him feel comfortable\u201d.\nIn line with several players and the assistant, Ginafranco Zola, all of whom have urged Hudson-Odoi to stay at Chelsea, Sarri was full of praise for the player\u2019s progression. \u201cWe are very happy with the player because he is improving. He is improving a lot I think in the defensive phase. Now, he needs to improve in some movements without the ball. He is working very well and I\u2019d like to have him in the future.\u201d\nChelsea are under investigation by Fifa over possible violations of rules on the signing of foreign players under the age of 18 but have looked into whether they have grounds to report Bayern for approaching Hudson-Odoi illegally.\nWith Morata potentially in line for a move to Sevilla and Cesc F\u00e1bregas completing his switch to Monaco, Sarri said he has identified his targets in this window following the signing of Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund, who will arrive in the summer.\n\u201cI spoke with the club and the club knows very well my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion we need two players. Then it depends on the club decision.\u201d\nAn offer from Barcelona for Willian, who like Hudson-Odoi and Eden Hazard is out of contract in 2020, that involved a swap deal with Malcom, has been rejected.\n\u201cHe is really very important,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cI think he can do better. He can do better because the potential is higher but he is really very important for us and it is impossible to lose him in January.\n\u201cUsually he wants the ball always on the feet and so he can improve in his movements without the ball and he has the potential to score more.\u201d",

We have the option of doing detailed individual advertisement through Facebook, [we can] build networks of fake news websites: aggregating articles and spinning meaning.\u201d\nThe four-day project, which ends on Sunday and takes its name from an astroturfing campaign run by the US government, is run by Lund and his team of 12 volunteers or \u201cemployees\u201d, who applied to take part in the work and include former Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama campaign photographer Alan Mozes.\nThey have taken over a whole floor of the gallery and the general public are encouraged to engage and learn about how technology and politics work together to influence them. The installation looks every bit the modern political campaign headquarters, with bold logo, open-plan office and sessions including \u201cmindfulness\u201d breaks for the staff.\n\u201cWith this piece you either program or you are programmed,\u201d says Lund. \u201cYou need to learn how different algorithms can get your attention, or how Instagram is deeply manipulative in its reward system by triggering dopamine.\u201d\nLund believes that in the current climate, with the UK poised to leave the EU after a referendum dominated by misinformation and falsehoods, we have a stark choice: either \u201cinform yourself or become a slave to the systems that control us\u201d.\n\u201cThe level of profiling and modelling that Facebook and other data-gathering operations enable I find deeply problematic,\u201d says Lund. \u201cIt would make George Orwell turn in his grave because it\u2019s far more dystopian than 1984. How much data have we been tricked to give up? Facebook is the greatest surveillance apparatus ever made.\u201d\nBut can a work like this be relevant when it\u2019s based in a pro-remain area of the country and run by what pro-Brexit voices might call \u201cliberal elites\u201d? \u201cThe physical aspect of the campaign is here [in central London] but the tools can be used anywhere,\u201d says Lund. \u201cLike we see with the Russian influence in decisions made in the EU and America. So location is slightly irrelevant.\u201d\nWhat about the idea that this is the cultural elite trying to spread its leftist views? \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s not that,\u201d he counters. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to unmask the mechanisms that are being used and abused by both sides \u2013 left and right. Also, if you had a problem with that, wouldn\u2019t you have a problem with the Leave campaign using actual illegal strategies to win a campaign?\u201d\nThe somewhat tongue-in-cheek conceit masks the true aim of Lund\u2019s work, which is to provoke questions about and interrogate the ways the British public was manipulated during the campaign and in the two years since the referendum.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of coming off as arrogant, as the person who is going to fix it all. The defence is, it\u2019s not necessarily about Brexit, it\u2019s about the tools and mechanisms. And these are available to everybody.\u201d\nAs the vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal approaches next week and the repercussions of the UK\u2019s divorce from the EU start to be realised, perhaps there\u2019s no better time to get to grips with the technology that made it possible.",

The alleged victim, who gave evidence, said she believed he was Clarke, Hepburn\u2019s flatmate, whom she had returned with following a night out.\nNeither Clarke, who moved to Nottinghamshire at the end of last season, or Kohler-Cadmore, who joined Yorkshire in 2017, was accused of wrongdoing on the night in question \u2013 the latter was not present in the flat \u2013 and they faced no criminal charges themselves.\nBut some of the evidence heard in court \u2013 chiefly that referencing a WhatsApp group recording sexual conquests \u2013 is understood to have prompted the England and Wales Cricket Board to stand Clarke and Kohler-Cadmore down from the upcoming Lions tour pending an investigation by the governing body.\nClarke, who was present on the night in question but said in court that he had fallen asleep in a toilet at the time of the alleged incident because of alcohol consumption, gave evidence while Kohler-Cadmore did not. Kohler-Cadmore was not specifically named as a contributor to the WhatsApp group other than the name \u201cTom\u201d being referenced.\nNevertheless, the ECB believes the 24-year-old batsman was part of the online chat group. The governing body\u2019s investigation will now continue but any possible cricketing disciplinary action against the three players would not take place until after Hepburn\u2019s legal case has been concluded.\nRepresentatives for Clarke and Kohler-Cadmore have been approached for comment.\nEngland Lions are due to face India A in a five-match 50-over series in Thiruvananthapuram from 23 January, before two unofficial \u2018Tests\u2019 against the same opposition in early February.

The group urgently needs to find a new way to raise cash after halting the planned sale of its Danish Magasin du Nord chain when it failed to receive strong enough offers.\nDebenhams said it had not ruled out any options, including an insolvency process that could speed up a plan to close up to 50 of its 165 UK stores over the next five years.\nHowever, the company turned down the \u00a340m loan from Sports Direct because it came with a demand for security over some Debenhams\u2019 assets that would have given Ashley\u2019s company a preferential position over other shareholders.\nSports Direct also demanded the right to add another 10% to its shareholding without making a formal takeover bid for the whole company. Under Takeover Panel rules anyone with more more than 29.9% must make a bid for the whole company. Debenhams feared such an agreement would give Ashley control of the company on the cheap.\nOn Friday Debenhams said: \u201cAs stated in December, we welcomed Sports Direct\u2019s stated intention to demonstrate their willingness to support Debenhams. Because the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, the board felt it could not accept the proposal.\u201d\nBecoming a major lender to Debenhams could be helpful in the Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley\u2019s aim to build a closer relationship between it and his struggling House of Fraser department store chain \u2013 which Sports Direct bought out of administration in August.\nDebenhams has already been weakened by the ousting of its chairman and chief executive from the boardroom on Thursday after major shareholders Sports Direct and Dubai-based retail billionaire Micky Jagtiani\u2019s Milestone Resources voted against them at the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\nThe chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire, stepped down immediately while the chief executive, Sergio Bucher, will stay on but not as a director.\nThe Guardian has learned that the Debenhams\u2019 interim chairman, Terry Duddy, met Sports Direct\u2019s Ashley soon after the meeting and held \u201cconstructive\u201d talks on how to move forward.\nCheshire, who is understood to have had a difficult relationship with Ashley, did not announce his resignation at the meeting as advisers attempted to persuade Jagtiani to change his mind right up until the final vote was held.\nSports Direct has not commented on its reasons for voting against Cheshire and Bucher.\nHowever, the letter to the parliamentary committee published on Friday made its frustrations clear, pointing out that Sports Direct had already written off in excess of \u00a3100m over its investment in Debenhams.",

They said the finding was upsetting and that toxic air must be cut to protect the health of the next generation.\nAir pollution is already known to harm foetuses by increasing the risk of premature birth and low birth weight. Recent research has also found pollution particles in placentas.\nThe effect of long-term exposure to dirty air on the risk of miscarriage has been analysed previously. Studies from Brazil to Italy to Mongolia found a link, but others failed to do so.\nHowever, the latest study is the first to assess the impact of short-term exposure to air pollution. It found that raised levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution that are commonplace around the world increased the risk of losing a pregnancy by 16%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty profound,\u201d said Dr Matthew Fuller, at the University of Utah\u2019s department of emergency medicine and one of the research team. \u201cIf you compare that increase in risk to other studies on environmental effects on the foetus, it\u2019s akin to tobacco smoke in first trimester pregnancy loss.\u201d NO2 is produced by fuel burning, particularly in diesel vehicles.\nThe research, published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, was conducted in Salt Lake City in the US, and surrounding urban areas. But Fuller said the results were applicable elsewhere: \u201cThere are many places in the world that suffer from pollution that is far greater, so this is not a problem unique to Utah. This is a problem we are all facing.\u201d NO2 levels in Salt Lake City are similar to those in cities such as London and Paris.\nFuller was initially alerted to the issue when a family member miscarried during a particularly poor period of air quality in 2016. He said: \u201cThat triggered the question in my mind and then I started noticing anecdotally that I was seeing spikes in miscarriage numbers in the emergency department during and after [pollution spikes].\u201d\nFuller teamed up with the population health scientist Claire Leiser and others to see if the effect was real. They analysed the records of more than 1,300 women who attended the emergency department after miscarriages from 2007 and 2015.\nA woman\u2019s exposure to air pollution at the time of the miscarriage was compared with similar times when she did not miscarry, meaning that age, weight, income and other personal factors were accounted for. The strongest link with a lost pregnancy was the level of NO2 in the seven days before the miscarriage.\nThe average seven-day NO2 level across the whole period was 34 micrograms per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3), but peaked at 145\u03bcg/m3. The researchers found an increase in NO2 pollution of 20\u03bcg/m3 was associated with a 16% rise in the risk of miscarriage. \u201cMany of us think there is an effect [of air pollution] on our health, but to find out there are actual effects on unborn children is very upsetting,\u201d said Fuller.\nHigher levels of particle pollution were also linked to a greater risk of miscarriage, as found in a previous study, but the association in the new work was not statistically significant. However, other recent studies on long-term exposure to particle pollution in Iran, Italy, Mongolia and the US found significant links. Other air pollutants, including ozone and sulphur dioxide have also been implicated in these analyses.\nThe mechanism by which air pollution could harm a foetus has not yet been established but a likely hypothesis is that the pollutants cause oxidative stress and inflammation.\nDr Sarah Stock, at the University of Edinburgh and not part of the research team, said: \u201cAir pollution is clearly detrimental to the health of millions of mothers, babies and children worldwide. Measures to reduce the impact of air pollution are crucial to ensure the health of future generations.\u201d\nBut she noted that the risk of miscarriage varied substantially with the number of weeks of pregnancy and that the study had not been able to record this information, potentially introducing a bias into the result.\nLeiser said: \u201cIf we were able to get the gestation stage that would be a real benefit, to get a sense of when the woman is most at risk. There really needs to be more studies done on this specific issue. But we know enough about air pollution and birth outcomes to say, if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor.\u201d\nThe best action is to cut overall levels of pollution in urban areas, said Fuller. However he said women could choose to time their pregnancies to avoid the most polluted times of year. This is winter in Utah and many other places, but will vary depending on local conditions.\nFuller also said pregnant women could avoid exertion on polluted days and consider buying indoor air filters. \u201cBut in the developing world these are luxuries many people can\u2019t afford,\u201d he said.",

I am responsible\u2019 Lampard hits out after Derby\u2019s preparations were \u2018disrupted\u2019\nMarcelo Bielsa has accepted responsibility for the spy row involving Leeds before their Championship match with Derby on Friday.\nThe FA is to investigate the incident after a member of Leeds\u2019 staff was seen acting suspiciously outside Derby\u2019s training ground on Thursday.\nThe Leeds manager told Sky Sports: \u201cIt\u2019s true there was someone from Leeds. The responsibility for this is me.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if this is legal, illegal, right or wrong. It\u2019s enough Frank Lampard and Derby felt it was not the right thing to do. I didn\u2019t behave well. I talked to Lampard and he told me I didn\u2019t respect fair play. I have a different point of view on it but the important thing is what Frank and Derby think. I am responsible for it because I didn\u2019t ask for permission to do it.\n\u201cWithout trying to find a justification, I have been using this kind of practice since the qualifications for the World Cup with Argentina. This is not illegal, we have been doing it publicly, we talk about it in the press. For some people it is the wrong thing, for others it\u2019s not.\u201d\nLampard was irritated by what he called a disruption but acknowledged Bielsa\u2019s contrition.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. He said the same to me, so I\u2019m pleased,\u201d said the Derby manager. \u201cOn a sporting level, it\u2019s bad, in my opinion. Talking about \u2018I did it somewhere else, it\u2019s fine\u2019 \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work for me. It\u2019s disrupted our preparations. Police had to come to the training ground, so that was disruptive. We were training on team tactics, shape, personnel and the fact that Harry Wilson wasn\u2019t training.\n\u201cHe\u2019s admitted it, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any further action but we had a guy in the bushes before we played Leeds earlier this season and we lost 4-1.\u201d\nPolice confirmed officers were called to the training ground and a man was spoken to at the perimeter fence. No arrest was made. A statement read: \u201cOfficers conducted routine checks which were all above board. Despite media reports, no damage to the fence was found and the man was stopped outside the grounds. No arrests were made and the man was sent on his way.\u201d\nMauricio Pochettino said the episode was not a surprise. The Tottenham manager played under Bielsa at Newell\u2019s Old Boys, Espanyol and Argentina. \u201cThere is nothing wrong to try to find information and know a bit more about what the opponents are doing. That happened 30 years ago in Argentina. Not only Marcelo, all the managers were like this,\u201d he said. \u201cHere maybe it is a little bit weird but in Argentina it happened. It is not a big issue or a big deal.\u201d",

She fled her family while visiting Kuwait and flew to Bangkok, where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel to avoid deportation and grabbed global attention by mounting a social media campaign for asylum.\nShe had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia, and in interviews over the past few days spoke of physical and psychological abuse she had suffered at the hands of her brother and father.\nHer case highlighted the cause of women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia, where several women fleeing abuse by their families have been caught trying to seek asylum abroad in recent years and returned home. Human rights activists say many similar cases go unreported.\nQunun is flying to Toronto via Seoul, South Korea, according to Thai immigration police chief, Surachate Hakparn. This was confirmed by Qunun who tweeted an image of her on board a plane, with the caption \u201cthird country \u2013 I did it\u201d.\n\u201cI would like to thank you people for supporting me and saving my life,\u201d Qunun wrote. \u201cTruly I have never dreamed of this love and support. You are the spark that would motivate me to be a better person.\u201d\nSpeaking at a press conference on Friday night, Surachate said Qunun was \u201clively, she\u2019s smiling and healthy,\u201d and intended on bettering her English when she arrived in Canada. Surachate confirmed her had met with Qunun\u2019s father, who denied abusing his daughter but said she might have felt \u201cneglected\u201d as one of ten children.\n#3rd country \u2708\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf77 #ididit \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc pic.twitter.com/rFsqZpM02O\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was pleased to offer her asylum because \u201cCanada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights and to stand up for women\u2019s rights around the world and I can confirm that we have accepted the UN\u2019s request.\u201d\nSeveral other countries, including Australia, had been in talks with the UN\u2019s refugee agency to accept Qunun, Surachate said earlier in the day. \u201cShe chose Canada. It\u2019s her personal decision,\u201d he said.\nThe decision is likely to exacerbate Canada\u2019s already poor relations with Saudi Arabia, which last year barred the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh after Ottawa criticised Saudi authorities for detaining women\u2019s activists.\nThe office of the UN high commissioner for refugees welcomed Canada\u2019s decision. \u201cThe quick actions over the past week of the government of Thailand in providing temporary refuge and facilitating refugee status determination by UNHCR, and of the government of Canada in offering emergency resettlement to Qunun and arranging her travel were key to the successful resolution of this case,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\nPhil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, cited Qunun\u2019s \u201ccourage and perseverance,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is so much a victory for everyone who cares about respecting and promoting women\u2019s rights, valuing the independence of youth to forge their own way, and demanding governments operate in the light and not darkness.\u201d\nQunun was stopped on 5 January at Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport by immigration police who denied her entry and seized her passport. After barricading herself in an airport hotel room, her social media campaign attracted enough public and diplomatic support to encourage Thai officials to admit her temporarily under the protection of UN officials, who granted her refugee status Wednesday.\nQunun\u2019s father arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday, but his daughter refused to meet him. Surachate said the father, whose name has not been released, denied physically abusing Qunun or trying to force her into an arranged marriage, which were among the reasons she gave for her flight.\nSurachate said Qunun\u2019s father wanted his daughter back but respected her decision. \u201cHe has 10 children. He said the daughter might feel neglected sometimes,\u201d he said.\nCanadian officials were reluctant to comment further until she landed safely in Canada.\nQunun\u2019s plight has emerged at a time when Riyadh is facing intense scrutiny from western allies over the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen.\nQunun had previously said on Twitter that she wanted to seek refuge in Australia.\nThe Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, met senior Thai officials in Bangkok on Thursday and later said Australia was assessing Qunun\u2019s resettlement request.",

We are survivors ... and we will lead this country towards the glory it deserves,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 added, calling on the people, the international community and, crucially, Venezuela\u2019s armed forces to support him.\nGuaid\u00f3, who became president of Venezuela\u2019s national assembly last week, admitted there were no \u201cmagic solutions\u201d to an economic crisis fuelling what the UN calls one of the greatest exoduses in Latin American history.\nBut he called a day of nationwide demonstrations for 23 January to intensify pressure on Maduro before concluding by shouting the rallying cry: \u201cPeople of Venezuela: can we, or can\u2019t we?\u201d \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed, se puede!\u201d the crowd roared back. \u201cYes we can!\u201d\nThe opposition took control of the national assembly in 2015 although it was effectively neutered by Maduro\u2019s controversial creation of a constituent assembly in 2017 that sparked deadly protests.\nYesiret M\u00e9ndez, a 20-year-old student who was in the crowd, said she had come to hear Guaid\u00f3\u2019s plan for the future: \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready to take to the streets again if necessary.\u201d\nCarmen de Jes\u00fas, 70, said she hoped Guaid\u00f3 would be able to take control. \u201cMaduro is usurping the power and the president of the national assembly should take over as an interim president.\u201d\nThere was international support for the move too, with the head of the Organisation of American States tweeting: \u201cWe welcome the assumption of @jguaido as interim President of \n #Venezuela in accordance with Article 233 of the Political Constitution. You have our support, that of the international community and of the people of Venezuela \n #OEAconVzla.\u201d\nBut there was also apprehension Guaid\u00f3\u2019s audacious move might backfire, triggering a renewed crackdown on regime opponents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly going to generate some sort of response from the government,\u201d said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group.\n\u201cThey could dissolve [the national assembly] \u2026 or they could try and arrest opposition leaders or Guaid\u00f3.\u201d\nAddressing a sympathetic audience of Latin American leftists on Friday afternoon, Maduro mocked his challenger, claiming most Venezuelans did not even know who he was. \u201cIt is a show \u2026 a Hollywood-esque show,\u201d Maduro said, adding: \u201cThe Venezuelan right is hopeless.\u201d\nVenezuela\u2019s chavista prison minister, Mar\u00eda Iris Varela Rangel, tweeted a more sinister message: \u201cGuaid\u00f3, I\u2019ve already prepared your cell and your uniform, I hope you name your cabinet quickly so I know who is going down with you.\u201d\nSmilde said Guaid\u00f3\u2019s unexpectedly bold challenge to Maduro was a tactic the most radical members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition had been pushing for. \u201cBut the problem with that is that they have no actual real power: they don\u2019t control the institutions, they don\u2019t control the guns and they don\u2019t control the money.\u201d\nOne Guaid\u00f3 ally told the energy news agency Argus Media he was aware of the \u201clife-threatening\u201d risks of his statement: \u201c[But] keeping silent and not invoking the constitution\u2019s authority to strip Maduro of his executive powers would have been a surrender to the dictatorial status quo and would have buried any chance of restoring democracy for years to come.\u201d",

Bielsa has led Leeds to the top of the Championship where they stand five points clear of second-placed Norwich and 11 ahead of sixth-placed Derby County.\nTo say Frank Lampard\u2019s side were well beaten would be an understatement as goals from Kemar Roofe and Jack Harrison erased memories of a mid-winter blip featuring two successive league defeats.\n\u201cWe lost to the better team,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that but\u2026\u201d It was a big but too. This will forever be a fixture haunted by memories of the bitter rivalry between Don Revie and Brian Clough and revived some of the dirty tricks detailed in David Peace\u2019s The Damned United.\nEarlier in the day Derby announced that police had been called to their training ground on Thursday following reports of a man equipped with binoculars, wire cutters and camouflage clothing hovering suspiciously on its boundaries.\nBielsa admitted he had sent a member of his backroom staff to spy on Lampard\u2019s preparations, revealing it was a ploy he had deployed ever since his days in charge of Argentina and Chile.\nUnimpressed, Lampard indicated that he believed it was no coincidence that, shortly before his side lost 4-1 to Leeds at home earlier in the season, a man was spotted lurking in the bushes beside their training complex.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that, at any level of sport, it\u2019s right to send men to break into private property,\u201d said Derby\u2019s manager afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing but I was very surprised by it \u2013 and by the frank admission he\u2019s done it before. Cheating is a big word but this is over the line. I spent 15 hours watching tapes of Leeds game this week and that\u2019s what the best managers do. I was a fan of Bielsa\u2019s from afar but I\u2019d rather not coach than send people undercover on their hands and knees in the undergrowth.\u201d\nIf MI6 are unlikely to be poaching the \u201cagent\u201d Bielsa dispatched to Derby any time soon, it rather begs the question as to how many other Championship rivals have been spied on since August?\nNot that Lampard\u2019s defence could use such dubious tactics as an excuse. That quartet should have conceded a penalty following Andre Wisdom\u2019s foul on Ezgjan Alioski but, although the referee pointed to the spot, a linesman had already flagged \u2013 controversially \u2013 for an offside against Alioski.\nIt was, though, merely a stay of execution. When Scott Carson could only punch Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s corner towards Jack Clarke, the latter proceeded to sweep beyond Craig Bryson and deliver a superb right-wing cross. It found Roofe in the right place at the right time to lash a first-time volley home.\nLampard stared at the ground. His players could barely get out of their own half and frequently seemed overwhelmed by the relentless tempo of Leeds\u2019 high pressing game. At times it was easy to imagine that Bielsa\u2019s team had a couple of extra players on the pitch.\nDerby were failing to work out the home side\u2019s highly fluid formation \u2013 one minute 4-1-4-1 and 3-3-3-1 the next \u2013 and kaleidoscopic, opponent perplexing, positional rotation. Alioski not only alternated between left-back and midfield but occasionally centre forward too.\nHis side doubled their advantage at the outset of the second half. Once again Clarke provoked panic on the right and, once again, Carson made less than perfect contact as he misread his looping cross. The goalkeeper\u2019s weak punch travelled only as far as Alioski who played it back in for Harrison to score from close range.\nSpy-gate may be boiling up but Leeds show few signs of burning out. \u201cI would accept any sanction the club or federation make against me,\u201d said an unrepentant Bielsa. \u201cI respect the morals of the country where I work but I won\u2019t say I won\u2019t do it again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a person that cheats. I have done this practice for many years. It\u2019s legal in South America \u2013 and England, too, but it doesn\u2019t provoke indignation in South America.\u201d",

        "content": "Gloucester did not so much bow out of Europe last night as sink without trace on another bruising evening for English self-esteem. Munster may not be quite the force of old but they were still comfortably too strong for the Cherry and Whites, this bonus-point victory all but ensuring the Irish province a place in the tournament\u2019s last eight.\nLong before the end the hosts had been chewed up and spat out by their visiting tormentors in spearmint green, whose outstanding fly-half Joey Carbery contributed 26 points including two of his side\u2019s five tries. If Johnny Sexton\u2019s sore calf does not clear up swiftly, Ireland have a ready-made pedigree alternative; as if his all-round game was not impressive enough, the 23-year-old has now landed every one of his last 17 kicks at goal.\nDanny Cipriani, sent off in the reverse fixture at Thomond Park and just back after a month out with a pectoral muscle injury, could only look on wistfully behind a retreating pack. Gloucester could conceivably have lost by even more, with Conor Murray enjoying an armchair ride at scrum-half. Tadhg Beirne had another influential game in the Munster second row and, in the back row too, this developed into another Irish masterclass around the tackle area.\nThe wing Andrew Conway scored one try, this time from a deft left-footed Carbery chip, and almost collected another before his outside-half rounded off a classy night with a 60-metre interception try. In terms of close-quarters physicality and killer instinct, Munster were a cut above as they registered the most points Gloucester have ever conceded at home in Europe. The home side were slightly weakened by injury and their coach, Johan Ackermann, with his available players looking increasingly battered, would love to have had the same freedom to rest players as Munster did last weekend. The message to Eddie Jones\u2019s England, heading to Dublin for the opening round of the Six Nations in three weeks\u2019 time, was clear enough.\nDespite the atmospheric buzz around the stadium for a game the hosts simply could not afford to lose, Gloucester were forced to play catch-up from an early stage. Three psychologically important scrum penalties to Munster plus a glaring dropped high ball by Charlie Sharples did little to boost morale and gradually Munster\u2019s pack began to exert more consistent pressure. A prolonged spell of possession ended with Murray throwing a lovely pass to allow Carbery to skip over unopposed after 23 minutes and worse soon followed.\nThe visiting loosehead Dave Kilcoyne, already enjoying himself opposite Fraser Balmain, put in a fine tackle to down his opposite number Josh Hohneck and, when Gloucester were subsequently pinged on the floor, Carbery\u2019s long penalty put his side 13-3 up after 27 minutes.\nThe odd neat touch from Cipriani was never going to be enough. Before half-time Munster strung together another brutal 26 phases before Rory Scannell, cutting back against the grain and spinning out of Sharples\u2019s tackle split the home defence with ominous ease. The interval scoreline of 20-3 did not entirely reflect Gloucester\u2019s efforts but Munster\u2019s ceaseless commitment deserved its reward.\nThis was their sixth successive win over Gloucester and on each occasion the margin has been at least 12 points. Even when the Cherry and Whites did finally score their first try of the evening, after 52 minutes through Ollie Thorley, the wing\u2019s sharp finish was rather less memorable than the 35 phases it took to construct the score, Munster\u2019s defence close to their own line bordering on the extraordinary.\nTypically Munster, despite losing their captain, Peter O\u2019Mahony, with a popped rib which might threaten his availability against England, went straight back up the other end to create a score for the ever-reliable Keith Earls. A consolation try for Balmain was nowhere near enough to save Gloucester from the European scrapheap along with their compatriots Bath, Wasps, Leicester and, potentially, Exeter and Newcastle as well. Saracens could well be the only Premiership survivors in the last eight, food for thought for all connected with the English club game.",

And when Solskj\u00e6r did what he did, to win the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich, Pochettino found himself celebrating as crazily as any United fan.\nThe way the Tottenham manager tells it, he was simply carried along by the emotion of the moment. Pochettino was an Espanyol player at the time and, together with his teammate, Toni Jim\u00e9nez \u2013 who is now the goalkeeper coach at Spurs \u2013 he had watched the first half from seats that were not so great. And so he and his partner-in-crime decided to upgrade.\nThey were on the same level as the VIP area and they hopped from block to block until they got there. Remarkably, they spied two padded seats that were empty, jumped into them and, even more remarkably, they were not moved on.\n\u201cWe sat, like this,\u201d Pochettino says, making like the meekest of boys. \u201cThen, the second half started and we watched it from there \u2013 the presidents\u2019 [area]. When Sheringham scored for 1-1 in the last minute, we said: 'Wow, amazing game, now injury-time.' And then when Solskj\u00e6r scored, we were celebrating. How I shouted for a Manchester United goal was incredible! I don\u2019t know why because in that moment, we were neutral. But the atmosphere was amazing.\u201d\nIt is a story that resonates particularly loudly because on Sunday at Wembley, Pochettino\u2019s Spurs take on a United team that has been re-energised under the caretaker management of Solskj\u00e6r. And, of course, there is the small matter of who may be given the United job on a permanent basis in the summer.\nCould it yet be Solskj\u00e6r, who has won his first five matches \u2013 albeit against low-ranking opposition \u2013 but, perhaps more importantly, has reacquainted United with a sense of adventure and fun? The Spurs game is his first major test. Were he to triumph, it would certainly help his case.\nOr could it be Pochettino, whom United and Sir Alex Ferguson have in their sights? Ferguson, now back to health and influence, had advanced Pochettino\u2019s candidacy in 2016, post Louis van Gaal, only for the Glazers to prefer the surer thing of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\nPochettino wears his vanity more appealingly than Mourinho these days and since the Old Trafford sacking of a man that he counts as a friend, he has been cute, playful and frankly mischievous at various times with regard to the stories linking him with United at the end of the season.\nIt is a soap opera that promises to run and run, although Pochettino played it straight for a change on Friday at his pre-match press conference when he stressed that Premier League points were the only thing on his mind. He looked positively flabbergasted when asked whether his players had joked with him about the United job. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are too respectful.\u201d\nThere has been the temptation to bill the game as Pochettino versus Solskj\u00e6r, with the winner taking all, but that is not only glib, it is incorrect. It is so for several reasons and the biggest one is a man called Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman who, if United come calling for Pochettino, will make it unbelievably difficult for them to take him.\nThere was a time when United would have who they wanted from Spurs \u2013 Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov, even if the latter\u2019s move came after tortuous negotiations. Ferguson infamously described the business of dealing with Levy as \u201cmore painful than my hip replacement\u201d.\nThere has since been a shift in the relationship between the clubs and not only because Spurs finished above United in 2014, 2016 and 2017. As Pochettino noted, the economic landscape of the Premier League has shifted, making all of the clubs more financially powerful and able to resist unwanted overtures from the bigger ones.\nLevy has long been a nightmare to deal with but now it can be close to impossible. United, for example, wanted to take Eric Dier from Spurs in 2017. There was never any possibility of Levy sanctioning the departure of a player he wanted to keep. \u201cDaniel is, as you know very well, so tough to negotiate with,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cFor different clubs in England to do business with him, it\u2019s so difficult.\u201d\nPochettino, unusually, does not have an agent and he negotiated the new five-year contract he signed last May directly with Levy. Not unusually, he thought that he did a good job.\n\u201cFor me, if there was one person that was easy to do business with, it was Daniel,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think it was more difficult for him than me because I am the manager and he cannot upset me.\u201d\nIf United or Real Madrid were to try to take Pochettino in the summer, it is likely that the dynamics of any negotiation between him and Levy would be different. In Levy\u2019s favour would be the length of Pochettino\u2019s contract and, crucially, the absence of a buyout clause in it.\nAs recent history has shown, Tottenham talent does not get away from Levy without a fight or, in some instances, by playing an ugly game of brinkmanship. Just ask Berbatov. Or Luka Modric and Gareth Bale.\nIf Pochettino does want a new challenge, he may have to ask himself just how hard he is prepared to push for it. Levy has been here before with some of his players and, although it would be a new experience with a manager, he would approach it with trademark iron fists.\nFerguson knows this better than anyone. He did not try to sign Modric, even though he liked him, because he could not face dealing with Levy again. Pochettino versus Solskj\u00e6r? There is a third player in the game.",

A lot of players want to follow his path\u2019\nDominic Solanke believes young English players are increasingly unwilling to wait for their chance to prove themselves at the biggest clubs in the country and will follow his example, as well as that of Jadon Sancho, by leaving in order to find first-team football.\nSolanke completed a \u00a317m move from Liverpool to Bournemouth last week, a fee that is somewhat remarkable given the 21-year-old\u2019s playing record \u2013 one 17-minute substitute appearance for Chelsea in October 2014 followed by 21 appearances, 16 of which came off the bench, and only one goal scored for Liverpool having moved there in May 2017.\nHe did score seven goals in 25 Eredivisie appearances during a loan spell at Vitesse Arnhem, while at Chelsea, and was also a key part of the England Under-20 squad who won the World Cup in 2017. As such, he backs himself to be a success at Bournemouth and views his decision to join Eddie Howe\u2019s side as part of a wider trend that began when Sancho moved from Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund two summers ago. The winger was deemed by some to have taken a risk but he has thrived at the Bundesliga leaders and has gone on to become part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior setup.\n\u201cThat [Sancho\u2019s success at Dortmund] has affected everyone,\u201d said Solanke, who has one England cap. \u201cWhen one young player sees another young player doing that they think they can do it as well, especially when everyone is playing at international level together. Sancho is doing well in Germany and a lot of players would like to follow his path. What he\u2019s done, getting into the England team at such a young age, it will influence a lot of young players.\u201d\nCallum Hudson-Odoi could become the next young domestic talent to leave one of England\u2019s biggest clubs in order to gain first-team football, with the 18-year-old Chelsea winger the subject of a \u00a335m bid from Bayern Munich and supposedly keen to make the switch given he has yet to start a Premier League game for Maurizio Sarri\u2019s side.\n\u201cI think every footballer just wants to play,\u201d said Solanke when commenting on his own lack of opportunities at Stamford Bridge, as well as at Anfield. \u201cYou want to show what you can do and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to playing here.\u201d Solanke will have to wait for that opportunity given he is still recovering from the muscle injury that meant a move to Crystal Palace fell through at the start of the month.\nIn contrast, Nathaniel Clyne is already up and running for Bournemouth having also joined the club from Liverpool on a loan deal that runs until the end of the season. The right-back started last week\u2019s FA Cup third-round defeat to Brighton and is in line to do the same against Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday.\nLike Solanke, Clyne is enthused by the prospect of regular first-team football at Bournemouth having struggled for that at Anfield.\nSpeaking alongside the striker on Friday, the 27-year-old also dismissed claims from Neil Warnock that he had already agreed to join Cardiff before moving to the south coast. Warnock last week accused Liverpool of \u201clacking class\u201d over Clyne\u2019s situation before going on to describe himself as \u201cdisappointed\u201d, having given the player his first taste of first-team football while manager of Crystal Palace in 2008.\n\u201cNothing was agreed,\u201d insisted Clyne. \u201cIt was just talks, really, between my agent and the clubs, and ultimately I made the decision to come to Bournemouth. I\u2019m just fully focused now on training and playing for Bournemouth.\u201d",

        "content": "Murray expects to have surgery after his last match \u2018I was in too much pain, I wasn\u2019t enjoying it any more\u2019\nAndy Murray, a complex man in search of simple pleasures, is resigned to hobbling away in pain from the sport that has been his life for more than two decades. But, as he contemplates what may be his last appearance on a tennis court \u2013 against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday \u2013 the manner of his leaving still consumes him.\nHe has two stark choices: replace the hip that has turned him into a walking target and dream about another improbable comeback in the distant future, or have what is known as re-surfacing, a midway solution that would rescue at least some of his athleticism, if not enough for him to play professional tennis.\nFor months Murray fought against the notion that soon the modest inscription on his Twitter biography \u2013 \u201cI play tennis\u201d \u2013 would be as redundant as his rackets.\n\u201cMy hip needs to be replaced at some stage,\u201d he admitted on Friday in Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s badly damaged. But I\u2019ve dealt with the feeling for a very long time. I\u2019d say: \u2018If I can reduce the pain, it\u2019s something I\u2019ll be able to compete with.\u2019\n\u201cBut it got to a point where it wouldn\u2019t improve. I can\u2019t damage my hip more by playing. Obviously it will get worse [with age] but there are operations that will fix that. If I stop playing tennis today, I would seriously consider having an operation because, day to day, life is not fun if I can\u2019t do stuff I would want to do \u2013 even if I wasn\u2019t a professional athlete.\n\u201cI would want to go and play football with my friends or go and play 18 holes of golf \u2013 whereas now I can\u2019t think of anything worse than going and playing five-a-side football because I can\u2019t kick a football.\n\u201cThere is a possibility it [a hip replacement] could prolong my career. Hip resurfacing is something that has been around for 15 years and has been successful for a younger generation of people that have had issues with hips. It allows them to live a very active lifestyle and that is why, I understand from speaking to experts, it is a better option for somebody of my age.\n\u201cIf I was to stop playing today, that is something I would consider because it would allow me to run around a little bit more freely than with a hip replacement. I\u2019m sure there are some doctors and surgeons who would dispute that and say a hip replacement is better. But there are quite a few athletes out there who have gone back to competing after having [resurfacing] done. As somebody who wants to live an active lifestyle, it\u2019s a better option for me.\u201d\nHe pretty much made his mind up that his career was over after a wretched third practice session with Fernando Verdasco in Miami in early December. The pain shooting through his right hip went straight to his heart and he told his team: \u201cThis is it. I need to know when this is over. My hip is killing me.\u201d Murray recalled: \u201cI had tears in my eyes. I said to them: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be continuing to go through that for nothing any more.\u2019\u201d\nMurray needed a result or an end-point, as he calls it, a scoreline. \u201cThere have been points through the last year [since hip surgery in Melbourne] where I had spoken about stopping. I was in too much pain, wasn\u2019t enjoying it. It didn\u2019t feel like the surgery had worked. I had been advised after having the operation that things could improve after up to a year to 18 months. I was advised to see how that goes. Then I went off to Philadelphia and did different rehab, which helped and improved things to a point.\n\u201cBut my hip doesn\u2019t recover from matches or training any more. In Brisbane [last week, when he lost in straight sets in the second round to the world No 16 Daniil Medvedev], I felt OK in the first match \u2013 not amazing, just OK. But next day I felt quite a bit worse. As a tournament goes on, the pain gets worse, so my performance drops. There\u2019s no possibility for me to do well.\u201d\nHe has consulted his wife, Kim, and spoken to his mother, Judy, and brother, Jamie, who were on their way to Melbourne, he said, where they would more fully take on board what he is going through.\n\u201cI\u2019d imagine they are pretty gutted for me. They know everything I have gone through \u2013 well, to a certain extent they do. I have spoken to them a lot, probably my mum more than my brother. They know this isn\u2019t a decision I want to take but one I feel I have to. You guys all have loved ones as well, you know what it is like.\n\u201cLook, at the end of the day, it is only tennis. It\u2019s just a game, whatever. There is more to life than that. But for many reasons it\u2019s been more than that for me. Stopping the way it\u2019s happened doesn\u2019t sit particularly well with me. It\u2019s not how I would want to finish playing. I don\u2019t think any athlete wants that. They want to go out when they decide, not have their body telling them that is the case. That\u2019s the hardest part of it.\u201d\nMurray doubts he can ever replace the excitement that engaged him on court. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Well, maybe you can by taking certain substances, but you cannot recreate the high of winning Wimbledon or winning a Davis Cup. As much as the lows of losing here for a fifth time hurt, I always had that as a motivation. It was something that gave me drive, to get up and work hard. I don\u2019t anticipate being able to replace that. That\u2019s something that maybe when I finish I will be happy about, living a more stable life.\u201d\nAnd what have been the biggest highs?\n\u201cTwo things stand out to me: the second Wimbledon and carrying the flag at the Olympics. That was an off-court thing. There are not loads of things off the court that relate to my tennis. They don\u2019t for me come anywhere close to that.\u201d\nThe man who did more than any of his coaches to transform Murray into the fully fledged champion he became was Ivan Lendl.\nLendl said on Friday: \u201cAs Andy looks to wind down over the coming months the world of tennis will lose a great competitor but he will leave a measure of true grit that we all can learn from. Andy always left it all out on the court and I will look back with great feelings about the years we worked together. They were a lot of fun times filled with excitement. I am honoured to have been part of his team and to have been able to help him achieve as many of his lofty goals as possible.\u201d",

The 13-year-old was taken into police custody after the woman stopped at a nearby home to call police. She was reunited with her family on Friday after talking to investigators.\nInvestigators named the suspect as Jake Thomas Patterson, 21, and announced kidnapping and murder charges on Friday. Police said Patterson planned his actions and took steps to keep himself from being seen.\nPatterson was found down the road from the house from which Jayme escaped and was arrested based on a description of his vehicle the teenager was able to provide, police said. Authorities believe he was out looking for the girl when he was taken into custody.\nThe Barron county sheriff, Chris Fitzgerald, said investigators were still trying to determine what Jayme had experienced and establish why Patterson appeared to have been determined to abduct her.\n\u201cThe will of a kid to survive \u2013 it\u2019s unthinkable,\u201d said Fitzgerald, who was emotional after spending 88 days trying to find the teenager.\nFitzgerald said that as of Friday morning, there was no indication Patterson had a relationship with the family, nor was there evidence he had social media contact with Jayme. He said Patterson did have a tie to Jayme\u2019s hometown, Barron, but would not elaborate on the connection. He also said Patterson had changed his appearance before the attack and abduction in October and had shaved his head so that he wouldn\u2019t leave hair behind.\n\u201cThis case remains very active as we stand before you today,\u201d said Fitzgerald.\nDespite receiving thousands of tips concerning Jayme\u2019s disappearance, police said the search was made more difficult by steps the suspect took to keep himself from being seen by police and the public.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a remote area, there isn\u2019t a lot of houses in that area,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe not only concealed his identity from us, it appears he concealed her from other people, also his friends.\u201d\nInvestigators questioned Patterson, who is unemployed and has no criminal history locally or in the state of Wisconsin, on Friday morning. The house in which Jayme had most recently been held was searched.\nInvestigators said it was not yet clear if Jayme had been in the same house for the entire three months of her disappearance or if she was abused by her captor.\nThe local district attorney\u2019s office said it planned to issue a criminal complaint next week.\nSue Allard, Jayme\u2019s aunt, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune she could barely express her joy after hearing the news on Thursday night.\n\u201cPraise the Lord,\u201d Allard said, between sobs. \u201cIt\u2019s the news we\u2019ve been waiting on for three months.

He could not keep tabs on Milansbar on soft ground a year ago but may have the legs of that rival, now 12 years old, this time.\nTrained by Nigel Twiston-Davies, Cogry has already put up a couple of game efforts this season and refitted cheekpieces helped him to score at Cheltenham last month. He can again go well from the front here.\nCrosspark is a possible source of each-way value at 20-1, having won twice from three runs since November. He is still 1lb below the mark from which he was fourth in this race a year ago, when his petrol gauge was on empty from two-out. His stamina should take him further on this surface.\n1.50 Warwick Since Rocky\u2019s Treasure went over fences he has been beaten by only Santini. Still, he has to give weight to some talented rivals here, including White Moon, a chaser on looks whose record over fences so far is better than appears from his form figures.\n2.05 Kempton The eight-year-old Charbel is in the form of his life this season and looks one to stick with, bearing in mind how he ran away with the Peterborough a month ago. Top Notch is a real threat after a respectable return over hurdles.\n2.25 Warwick Birchdale having become a non-runner, this looks a good opportunity for Tidal Flow, who gave 6lb and a beating to a Nicky Henderson hotpot at Newbury just before Christmas. Stoney Mountain can make him work.\n2.40 Kempton The Lanzarote Handicap Hurdle can fall to Paul Nicholls for a third time in six runnings, thanks to Darling Maltaix, to be partnered by the yard\u2019s promising claimer, Lorcan Williams. Teaching this one to settle has been hard work but he finally did so behind a strong pace at Ascot last time and it may be a similar story here. He could have run at Kempton on Boxing Day without a penalty for that success but Nicholls preferred to come here off a much higher rating, suggesting this one has potential to do better again.\n3.15 Kempton Most of these need a few excuses to be made for their recent efforts but Glen Rocco, the youngest in the field, is a point-to-point winner who now seems to be going the right way in his first year over fences.

        "content": "Exclusion is \u2018correlated with layers of disadvantage,\u2019 says founder of education charity\nThe proportion of students in schools for excluded pupils in inner London is almost double the national rate, according to new analysis which raises concerns over the increasing exclusion rates from schools in England.\nResearch found that one in 116 pupils in the 13 inner city boroughs of the capital are in schools for excluded students \u2013 rising to one in 54 in one London borough, compared with the national figure of one in 196 pupils.\nThe rate was calculated by looking at headcount of students in pupil referral units as a proportion of all secondary school pupils.\nThis latest research was carried out by a new education charity called The Difference, set up to train a new generation of specialist teachers to help stem the flow of excluded pupils out of mainstream schools, first in London and then across England.\nKiran Gill, charity founder and fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said: \u201cI think we need to ask seriously whether the London story of school improvement has left some of the most vulnerable behind.\u201d\nLondon\u2019s schools are among the highest performing in the country, having undergone a radical transformation as a result of the London Challenge programme which saw huge improvements in the capital\u2019s schools between 2003 and 2011.\nHowever experts in the sector are concerned about the proportion of pupils who end up leaving high-achieving mainstream schools in inner London and moving into pupil referral units (PRUs) or other alternative provision (AP) for excluded students.\nSchool exclusion rates in England are coming under increasing scrutiny from government and the schools watchdog Ofsted. Last year saw the third successive annual increase, which ministers acknowledge is a concern, though they point out the numbers are still far fewer than the peak 10 years ago.\nAccording to official government data, Blackpool has the highest proportion of students in schools for excluded children with one in every 30 secondary school pupils in a PRU \u2013 or 3.3% \u2013 which is six and half times the national average.\nBut many of the inner London boroughs are among those with the highest proportions in England \u2013 in Kensington & Chelsea it is one in 54 pupils in a PRU (1.8%), in Islington, it is one in 65 (1.5%), in Camden one in 76 (1.3%) and in Haringey one in 84 (1.2%). The national average proportion of children in PRUs is 0.51%.\nEducation secretary Damian Hinds is due to appear before the education select committee next week when he is expected to be quizzed about rising exclusion rates, ahead of the publication of the government\u2019s review into school exclusion, chaired by Edward Timpson, which is expected in the next few weeks.\nAccording to Gill, the most vulnerable children with the most complex needs are disproportionately affected by exclusion, and London has large numbers of them.\n\u201cExclusion is correlated with multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage,\u201d she said. \u201cGrowing up in a low-income household, but also having other strains on a child outside of the school gates, like criminal exploitation, grooming and gangs. We know that\u2019s a particular problem in London at the moment.\u201d\nWith mounting concern about the increase in knife crime in the capital, there have been reports that some gangs are giving knives to pupils in order to get them excluded, thereby making those children more vulnerable to gang pressures.\n\u201cIn London we\u2019ve got some really exceptional PRUs where mainstream teachers know that if they do refer there, then their students will receive a good quality education,\u201d said Gill. However, the overall picture is bleak. Nationally pupils in PRUs underachieve on a spectacular scale \u2013 while 59.1% of pupils will manage a 9-4 pass in English and maths GCSEs, in PRUs and AP it\u2019s just 4.3%.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that London has some of the least inclusive schools, but I do think in some local authorities where PRU and AP populations are high but quality is low, we need to seriously prioritise both improving AP quality and reducing school exclusion.\u201d\nGill\u2019s new charity will launch a Teach First-style fast-track career programme on Saturday, inviting applications from top quality teachers to train for leadership roles in the sector serving excluded pupils. Successful candidates will spend two years in some of the capital\u2019s best schools for excluded pupils, returning to mainstream with new skills to support vulnerable pupils and reduce exclusions.\nSir Tim Brighouse, architect of the London Challenge, will be among those speaking at the launch. \u201cThe greatest challenge facing schools is the pandemic in mental ill health among young people,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe Difference leaders\u2019 programme will create a new generation of school leaders with skills to support the city\u2019s most vulnerable learners, and to reduce school exclusion.\u201d\nThe Department for Education said since 2010 it had taken decisive action to empower teachers to tackle poor behaviour in schools. \u201cPermanently excluding a child from school should only ever be a last resort, but it is wrong to assume that all children in pupil referral units and alternative provision have been excluded from other schools,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\u201cThe department firmly believes that all children, regardless of the setting, should receive a good education and that is why we have committed to reforming alternative provision. We have already made progress and have launched a \u00a34m AP innovation fund which is delivering projects to improve outcomes for children in alternative provision.\u201d\nDr\u00e9 Clinton-Barnes, 15, was just 23 minutes into his introductory day at Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney when he fell out with a teacher and was asked to leave. It was an inauspicious start.\nHe and his mother met with staff the following day and Dr\u00e9 returned to classes, but his school career at the celebrated London academy was beset by detentions and isolations. \u201cI talk a lot. I like to have the last word all the time.\u201d\nHis home life was complex, with periods in foster care. He kept running away and ended up being placed in a care home in Ashford in Kent where he cried himself to sleep every night for two weeks. \u201cAfter that it was calm.\u201d\nDr\u00e9 was home-schooled, then got a place at a local secondary school which lost patience with him when he got into a fight. After he was robbed at knife-point, his mother brought him back to London where he struggled to find a school that would accept him.\nHe is now a student at Wac Arts college in Camden, north London \u2013 an alternative provision free school for 14- to 19-year-olds, specialising in creative arts and media \u2013 and is thriving.\n\u201cThe schools I\u2019ve been to don\u2019t really have patience,\u201d said Dr\u00e9. \u201cThey have a thousand other kids to deal with.\u201d He doesn\u2019t blame them. \u201cI was distracting the class,\u201d he said. In any case things have ended up well.\n\u201cI live by a philosophy \u2013 everything happens for a reason. Here it\u2019s nice. They have more time for students because there\u2019s less students here and teachers explain the work more.\u201d\nGiulianna Barbosa, 15, has had a similarly disrupted education. She comes from a complex background and has dyslexia. She went to four different primary schools and her time in mainstream secondary school was spent mainly in isolation.\n\u201cMy family says that trouble finds me. I come out of class and there\u2019s a fight. I\u2019m the one that gets isolation for it and I\u2019ve got nothing to do with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI had big arguments with teachers. I kept on being accused of stuff that was nothing to do with me.\u201d\nLike Dr\u00e9, Giulianna was never permanently excluded but was the subject of a managed move to Wac Arts college, which suits her interest in creative arts and provides a more flexible approach than mainstream.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have patience,\u201d she says of mainstream schools. \u201cThey never understand. They are very straight. They will not bend for anything. Here [at Wac], they are the ones that adapt to your needs, rather than you adapt to them.\u201d\nCollege principal James Fornara says the rise in exclusions is directly linked to the way schools are now measured through school league tables, which means teachers are under pressure to focus on tests and getting pupils through qualifications. \u201cYoung people like Dr\u00e9 and Giulianna who have complicated and challenging lives can\u2019t fit into those boxes.\u201d",

        "content": "Thousands of older people could be forced to cut back on heating or food, Age UK warns\nScrapping the free TV licence for over-75s could push 50,000 older people into relative poverty, according to research by the charity Age UK, which is urging the government to pick up the bill of providing BBC services to elderly people.\nThe broadcaster opened a consultation last year on whether to start charging older people the \u00a3150.50-a-year fee, but the charity said such a move could distress many older people, \u201cpotentially forcing them to cut back on other essentials such as heating and food in order to remain informed, entertained, stimulated and connected to the world beyond their doorstep\u201d.\nAge UK calculated that forcing over-75s to start paying for BBC services could hit disposable incomes and leave tens of thousands of households facing a choice between being able to watch television or being pushed into relative poverty, which is defined as households with less 60% of median household income.\n\u201cContrary to the stereotype suggesting that everyone in later life is well-heeled, the reality is that most are living on quite modest incomes, particularly as you go higher up the age range,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK.\nFree TV licences for the over-75s were introduced by the last Labour government in 2000 in an attempt to reduce pensioner poverty, under an arrangement that saw the government directly compensate the BBC for lost revenue from public funds.\nHowever, under a deal struck by the Conservatives in 2015, the BBC agreed to pick up the bill, a move that saved the government money but left the broadcaster facing a substantial extra cost burden of about \u00a3750m a year.\nAlthough the BBC has publicly insisted it was keeping an open mind pending the results of the consultation, the corporation made it clear it would have to make enormous cuts to its programming budget and possibly close channels if it continued to provide services free to over-75s.\nIn June 2019 the BBC confirmed that it plans to make most over-75s pay the TV licence fee from 2020. The change will affect around three million households.\u00a0\nThe BBC says the annual cost of the free licences is \u00a3745m. They argue that maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies.\u00a0\nThe corporation has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people. It estimates this proposal will cost it \u00a3250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures.\nThe policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government. However, in 2015 the Conservatives, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to\u00a0shoulder the cost.\nThe government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers.\nJim Waterson,\u00a0Media editor\nThe corporation also commissioned research pointing out many older people are wealthier than in previous generations, although its consultation admits some may be put at higher risk of social isolation if they lose access to free television.\nThe former prime minister Gordon Brown, who introduced the benefit while chancellor, has strongly opposed any change and pointed out the 2017 Conservative manifesto included a pledge to maintain the free TV licence.\nReintroducing the TV licence for over-75s could also result in people in their 80s and 90s being prosecuted for failure to pay the licence fee, with potential prison sentences for those unable to pay.\nOne proposal is to introduce a discount rate for over-75s or take income into account, but Age UK also warned against means-testing the benefit amid fears vulnerable pensioners could fail to apply for such a discount.\nThe average BBC One viewer is now in their 60s, while the ageing audience for many BBC services means an increasingly large proportion of consumers will receive the corporation\u2019s services free unless a change is made.\nThe BBC is also facing the need to redirect funding to attract younger audiences, who are less likely to consume the broadcaster\u2019s content, especially in the face of competition from deep-pocketed rivals such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.\nA BBC spokesman said: \u201cFree TV licences for people over 75 are expected to cost \u00a3745m a year by 2021-22, and government funding for the scheme ends in June 2020. This is a really important issue. We\u2019re conscious that pensioner poverty is still an issue for some older people.\n\u201cWe have set out a range of options in our consultation \u2013 each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people. We need to hear everyone\u2019s views to help the BBC make the best and fairest decision.\u201d",

Its basket of goods cost \u00a3156.46, which was \u00a31.53 less than second-placed Asda and \u00a314.33 less than Waitrose, which ranked sixth. Which? said switching a monthly shop from Waitrose to Morrisons would save shoppers around \u00a3170 a year, based on buying the same basket of goods each time.\nWhich? editor Harry Rose said: \u201cMany of us will be looking to save money following the festive season, so shoppers will be pleased to know that they don\u2019t have to pay over the odds for their favourite brands.\u201d\nHe said shoppers could also save money by \u201cshopping smarter\u201d and swapping from branded to supermarket own-label products.\nThe traditional supermarket groups are fighting a rearguard action against the discounters Aldi and Lidl as more shoppers defect to the no-frills German chains to save money as food prices rise.\nAccording to food market analysts Kantar Worldpanel, two-thirds of UK households visited a discounter over Christmas, handing Aldi and Lidl their biggest ever slice of spending as political uncertainty prompted shoppers to keep a tight hold on their wallets.\nAldi sold nearly \u00a31bn of goods in the UK last month and in the week before Christmas its sales were up 10% on the same week the previous year. Lidl said on Friday its sales in the final six weeks of 2018 were up 8%.\nThe UK grocery market is worth around \u00a3190bn a year, but while there has been a shopping revolution in non-food goods \u2013 with 31% of sales moving on to the internet \u2013 online sales for food are still around 6% of the total, with Britons seemingly reluctant to make the switch.\nAmazon, however, is growing fast. The Kantar data shows its grocery sales surged 16% in the last three months of 2018.\n\u201cUnlike its high street counterpart, the grocery market has been less affected by the move to online,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel. \nOnline grocery shopping is up only 3.9% compared to this time last year.

We often use the ornate leaves as a garnish at Poco, our restaurant in Bristol. The tops have a slightly bitter flavour, so combine them with other herbs and a squeeze of lemon or vinegar as a counterbalance.\nWhile bitter greens add a depth of flavour and complexity, they also aid digestion. There has been little research on the health benefits of carrot tops, but they are rich in nutrients, containing around six times more vitamin C than the root, as well as lots of potassium, calcium and phytonutrients.\nCarrots are often grown in loose soil so they grow straight, which can make the leaves particularly sandy. Separate the tops from the roots when you get home, soak them in plenty of water, remove, drain and rinse again (this will also help prolong the life of the roots).\nLeafy greens tend to contain more pesticides, due to their surface area being mainly above the ground. For this reason, and other environmental and health benefits, I recommend buying organic.\nThis Argentinian-style green sauce, or salsa, is a thrifty way to use up carrot tops, converting them into a savoury condiment that can be used to dress pasta, vegetables or meat. One of my first jobs was at an Argentinian grill house in Honduras, Central America, where I watched the head chef like a sponge, soaking up all his tricks and mastery of food and fire. This is a variation on the salsa we served there.\n1 bunch organic carrots with tops20g parsley, finely chopped, including stalks2 tsp dried or chopped fresh oregano\n  2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed1 pinch dried chilli flakes\n  8 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil\n  3 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n  Salt and pepper\nRemove the carrot stalks and tops, soak them in water to remove any soil, and rinse.

        "content": "Visitor locked in compensation battle as handing over valuables for safekeeping goes awry\nThe Saw rollercoaster at Thorpe Park is claimed to be the scariest ride in the world \u2013 and it has become the stuff of nightmares for one customer because while she was on it the amusement resort managed to lose her handbag, allowing someone to steal her car.\nBobby Barrett, 28, is set to be more than \u00a32,000 out of pocket as a result of the incident. She says she has been left shocked by Thorpe Park\u2019s claim that it cannot be held liable for her losses.\nLike thousands of other visitors, Barrett was told to hand over her bag containing her valuables prior to boarding the Saw rollercoaster. Then she was given a wristband to return later in exchange for the bag.\nHowever, having enjoyed the ride, which starts with a \u201cbeyond-vertical\u201d, 30-metre drop, she handed back the wristband to retrieve her bag, only to be told it was not there. When it became clear that it had not simply been misplaced, things went from bad to worse.\nOnly later did staff agree to call the security team. By the time they arrived, 40 minutes later, her mobile phone had been switched off, so it could not be tracked, and her \u00a33,500 Ford Ka had been stolen from the car park.\n\u201cThe whole thing was a nightmare as my bag had my phone, wallet, medicine, car keys and other personal items in it. Staff initially said I would be compensated for my belongings \u2013 but that was before we realised that my car had been stolen,\u201d says Barrett, who works in compliance testing and plays for Henley Hawks rugby club.\n\u201cSince October I have been locked in a battle to get Thorpe Park to compensate me, but they won\u2019t do it.\u201d\nHer car was found abandoned three days later but it had been completely trashed by the thief and was declared a write-off. Also gone were three pairs of boots and all her other possessions from the car.\nThorpe Park has told the police it has no CCTV footage of the vehicle leaving the car park or of the baggage area showing her belongings being handed over or taken, she says.\nIt also refused to provide her with a replacement hire car. She says that after another battle, her insurer paid out \u00a3300 less than she owed on the car\u2019s finance deal \u2013 and she had to pay the \u00a3150 excess. Living in the countryside without access to public transport has meant she has had to rely on lifts and expensive taxis for almost two months.\n\u201cYou\u2019d think they would have been doing their best to help me but it\u2019s been the opposite,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe person dealing with it left and didn\u2019t pass the matter on, and I am left to constantly chase them. They even told me that my car being stolen is the same as it being stolen from a Tesco car park and that they cannot be held accountable for the actions of thieves. It is ridiculous; they gave the keys to someone. I will now see my car insurance rise hugely through no fault of my own and I have had to take a loan to buy a new car.\u201d\nAfter the Guardian\u2019s intervention, Thorpe Park, which is part of the Merlin Entertainments group that made a \u00a3323m profit in 2017, offered her \u00a3500. It said it has been working closely with the police to assist them, and Barrett, in trying to resolve the problem.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, our terms and conditions, which are visible throughout the park, state that guests leave belongings at their own risk,\u201d it says.\n\u201cHowever, on this occasion, we offered Ms Barrett compensation as a gesture of goodwill. With no further contact, we were unaware that she was dissatisfied with this offer. Should she be willing to engage directly, we would be happy to investigate the matter further.\u201d\nJonathan Silverman, a senior consultant with the London law firm Laytons, says unfair contract terms legislation means firms cannot claim that they accept no liability, as Thorpe Park has argued. He also described the \u00a3500 offer as\u201cderisory\u201d.\n\u201cIn the face of the evidence I have seen, I would say that this is a clear case of negligence\u201d he says. \u201cThorpe Park is required to perform its service with \u2018reasonable care and skill\u2019 \u2013 and that certainly doesn\u2019t look to be the case here.\u201d\nHe advises Barrett to tot up her reasonable losses and to bring a claim in the small claims court. He says he would be surprised if Thorpe Park still refused to pay once she sent a \u201cletter before action\u201d.",

        "content": "More people will die this week than at any other time of the year, official figures show\nProbate: the best way to deal with the will and estate\nJanuary is a cruel month. More people will die this week than any other week of the year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales. On average, there are 30% more deaths recorded in the second week of January than during the rest of the year.\nFor the loved ones left behind, the days after a death can be devastating and overwhelming in equal measure. Hundreds of decisions have to be taken: the funeral director, the service, the timing, cremation or burial, the wake, the catering and so on \u2013 and that\u2019s just the immediate stuff. Then there\u2019s the bureaucracy of death: registering the death, certificates, finding the will and beginning to sort out the estate, if there is one. Then add to that the time and effort of sorting out the deceased\u2019s possessions, going through all their paperwork and selling their property.\nSo where do you start? And how do you avoid being exploited at such a tough time?\nThe golden rules\nFran Hall at the Good Funeral Guide sets out her golden rules:\n Set your budget and shop around. You can save hundreds of pounds\n Ask a friend to help keep you on track.\n Take charge; don\u2019t pay others to do what you can do yourself.\n A good funeral is what you say and do, not what you spend.\n Do it your way; there are no rules, so follow your heart.\nHow much you should pay\nBut what is the right budget to set? Funeral prices have escalated rapidly in recent years, which has prompted an ongoing Competition and Markets Authority probe. The average cost is now about \u00a34,271, it found, yet by shopping around it\u2019s easy to knock \u00a31,000 off that.\nThere are a number of comparison websites that promise to obtain quotes from local undertakers. These include beyond.life and yourfuneralchoice.com, while Sun Life launched its Funeral Planning Mapper this week. They are useful as a guide to what\u2019s available locally, but don\u2019t rely too heavily on the specific price quoted. For example, Yourfuneralchoice gave us a quote for \u00a31,720 for a funeral director in Hastings, but said it could not guarantee the price. The same funeral director was priced at \u00a32,086 on beyond.life\u2019s site, which at least gave much more information about the quote. What it was showing was a basic price for funeral director services only, plus another \u00a3750 for the crematorium. A full burial was priced at \u00a33,364.\nNote that lots of funeral directors with what appears to be a long local history may be part of national chains, such as Dignity. We found in our price test on beyond.life that the Dignity-owned operations charged \u00a33,000 more for a full burial service that the cheapest operator.\nHall is scathing about the two big chains, Co-operative Funeralcare and Dignity. \u201cThey are more expensive than we think they ought to be, despite the fact they operate on an industrial scale. Avoid them.\u201d\nBut she adds: \u201cMore funeral directors than you might think are brilliant; some of course are awful. Mostly, the best funeral directors are good independents. They are likely to be less expensive and offer a higher level of personal service.\u201d\nThere are heaps of extra costs\nA funeral director fee is likely to cover just the mortuary, chapel of rest, coffin, pallbearers and hearse. You will be separately charged \u201cthird party\u201d costs for the minister of officiant conducting the funeral service, the burial plot (if required), church fees, and memorial masonry. If being cremated, there can be fees for interment or scattering of ashes.\nOther costs can easily add up to a further \u00a32,000, says Dignity on its website. It suggests the following average costs:\n Memorial: \u00a3824\n Catering: \u00a3362\n Limo hire: \u00a3264\n Flowers: \u00a3171\n Venue hire: \u00a3210\n Death notice: \u00a373\n Order sheets/service cards: \u00a382\nYou don\u2019t have to use a funeral director. And other myths\nThere is no law requiring you to use a funeral director or undertaker. Neither is there a legal requirement to hold a funeral. You do not have to accept responsibility for disposing of someone who has died. If no one accepts responsibility for disposing of a dead person, it becomes the job of the state. You may bury a dead person on your own land. And you don\u2019t even have to bury or cremate someone who has died. You can preserve them, should you wish.\nBut if you are going to use a funeral director, here are some tips\nEmma Freud wrote a deeply personal account in the Guardian in 2014 about organising funerals after she became \u201csomething of an expert treading this strange dark path\u201d.\nThe relationship with the funeral director is important, though brief. If you don\u2019t like them, get rid of them, as she did once. \u201cNo one shouted at me for changing my mind.\u201d\nShe recommends you ask the funeral director to come to your home. \u201cYou can drink your own tea. Sit in your own chair. It helps a bit.\u201d\nDon\u2019t give in to the \u201ctyranny by flowers\u201d \u2013 you can end up with an urn of \u201cugly chrysanthemums that have taken your entire budget and given you no joy.\u201d Neither did she opt for the black-car procession. \u201cYou\u2019ll save hundreds from the funeral bill and you won\u2019t start in an alien environment.\u201d\nYou can do it all for under \u00a31,000\n\u201cDirect cremation\u201d is a low-cost, no-frills option where there is no funeral service and mourners aren\u2019t present. In its most basic form it is \u2013 to put it bluntly \u2013 a disposal service. The funeral director arranges the cremation at a time that suits them, with the ashes returned later.\nSimplicity, the new direct cremation arm of Dignity, offers \u201cunattended funerals\u201d from \u00a3995, while the Co-op charges \u00a31,395 for cremation without ceremony, or \u00a31,250 in Scotland.\nBeware pre-paid funeral plans\nPeople taking these out often think it means everything will be taken care of. But at best, pre-paid funeral plans will pay a contribution towards the cost of the cremation or burial, but still leave the bereaved to pick up the rest of the bill.\nWhen Which? examined funeral plans, it found that many do not fully cover costs such as doctors\u2019 fees, and fees for church, minister, organists, choir, grave digging and burial plots. Neither do they cover the venue or catering for a wake, family flowers or a memorial.\nWhich? points out that \u201cFuneral costs can be paid from your estate after you die. Banks will normally release funds if they\u2019re presented with an itemised bill from a funeral director and a copy of the death certificate.\u201d\nWhere to go for help if you have no money to pay for a funeral\nDown to Earth, a project of the charity Quaker Social Action, runs a helpline for people on low incomes who are worried abut the cost of a funeral. Call 020 8983 5055 or go to quakersocialaction.org.\nIf you are on benefits, such as universal credit, pension credit or housing benefit, you may qualify for a government payment, called the Funeral Expenses Payment (information atgov.uk/funeral-payments).\nThe payment won\u2019t cover all the cost of the funeral, but will help pay burial and cremation fees, travel to the funeral and death certificates. You can also get up to \u00a3700 for any other expenses, such as funeral director\u2019s fees, flowers or the coffin.\n This article was amended on 15 January 2019. An earlier version referred to a report, which found on average there were 40% more deaths recorded in the second week of January than during the rest of the year. That was based on incomplete data. The Office for National Statistics puts that figure at closer to 30%.",

        "content": "From where to seek legal guidance through to the self-help or expert options\nHow to organise a funeral without paying unnecessary costs\nWhen a family member or friend dies, first comes the shock, then the grief \u2013 and finally an awful lot of paperwork. Getting a medical certificate, registering the death and arranging a funeral is only the start of it; the next step is to go through probate \u2013 the process of unlocking all the assets in the deceased\u2019s estate and sharing them out among the beneficiaries.\nProbate can be a lengthy and sometimes fraught process but it doesn\u2019t have to be so. Crucially, do not make the common mistake of simply handing over the job to the bereaved\u2019s bank or family solicitor because you will likely pay huge fees.\nThere are a host of specialists who will do it for less, plus lots of advice on how to do it yourself. Many recently bereaved people report finding doing the paperwork a welcome distraction. Note, if the deceased used a bank to draw up their will and appointed them as a co-executor, ask the bank to step down as executor. If you don\u2019t it will cost thousands of pounds. If the bank refuses to renounce its role, you can apply to the court to remove them.\nYou are under no obligation to use a solicitor but if you do decide to use one, don\u2019t just sign up with the family firm, or the bank, as the charges can be astronomical \u2013 in excess of \u00a340,000 even for a simple estate. It is because most firms operate hourly rates/percentage charging systems.\nA much better bet is to use a probate brokerage, such as Final Duties, that will find you a solicitor from its approved panel that will undertake probate for a fixed fee. You can phone Final Duties or do an online inquiry. It will charge an upfront fee of \u00a3295 and it earns commission from the one of five or so experienced solicitors it will put you in touch with. It does not get paid any commission if you later pull out, so has a big incentive to find you a good firm.\nFor a very basic estate with a few bank accounts, and no inheritance tax to pay, the cost can be \u00a32,500-\u00a33,000. For a more complex estate, which used multiple accounts and with some IHT to pay, you are looking at around \u00a36,000. Every extra layer of complication means extra probate fees. Note after 1 April the government-applied fees structure all changes.\nYour cheapest guided route is possibly the \u00a3299 self-help option using the probate service from Which? \u2013 England and Wales only. Users get a 64-page pack and email or phone support for six months from a trained probate specialist. There are timelines to help you keep on track and you will get all the forms necessary to apply for a grant of probate, including examples of complete forms and letter templates.\nIf you have been named as an executor in a will, then you should use Which? legal probate for executors. If there is no will and you are responsible for administering the estate, choose Which? legal probate for administrators.\nYes, and increasing numbers of people are opting to do so. The only thing that might stop you would be a lot of stocks, complex investments, buy-to-lets or inheritance tax problems.\nYou will need a copy of the death certificate for each of the deceased\u2019s assets (eg each bank account, credit card, mortgage etc) and before you can start probate, you will need to register the death.\nIf there is no will, the next of kin should apply to the court for \u201cletters of administration\u201d, also known as a \u201cgrant of administration\u201d.\nIf you cannot find the deceased\u2019s bank, building society or savings accounts, the website My Lost Account can find out where they held an account, although it can take up to three months to trace. You should also claim on any outstanding life or other insurance policies.\nFill in the probate application form PA1P yourself, or call the helpline for assistance in filling in the form. Provided there are no complications, it usually takes between four and eight weeks to get a grant of probate after you have submitted the application.\nOnce you totted up the assets, you will need to complete an inheritance tax form to HMRC to see if the estate is liable. If it is below the \u00a3325,000 IHT threshold, use form IHT205, or IHT400 if it is above. To do this you will need to work out how much the estate is worth. You will have to attend a probate interview and swear on oath.\nThere is a mountain of advice online on how to do it yourself \u2013 particularly on the government websites. There is nothing to stop you starting the process, before calling in an expert if it all becomes too much.",

        "content": "The outcome of the 2016 referendum horrified me. Despite my doubts about the European Union as an institution (its remoteness, lack of democracy, and inflexibility in dealing with crises such as the eurozone debt), I was, and remain, convinced that it\u2019s better for nations to work together to deal with problems than apart.\nSince then, the chaotic fallout of the vote has made Brexit seem even more scary: we have witnessed an unstable government, inept negotiations, early signs of the economic damage to come, and a looming no-deal outcome.\nSo why is it that, almost by the day, I grow more and more sympathetic to the people who voted leave? Not to the Boris Johnsons and Jacob Rees-Moggs, of course, nor to the middle-class little-Englanders across the Tory shires \u2013 nor either to the thuggish nationalist bigots of the far right: but to the millions of ordinary working-class voters who saw leaving the EU as a way to improve their lives and finally have their voices heard.\nRemember that brief moment after the referendum, when commentators started acknowledging the \u201cleft behind\u201d, admitting that they\u2019d been ignored for far too long? The swaths of the country beyond the M25 where industries had been lost, where communities had been torn apart, and where the idea of prosperity was a long-forgotten dream.\nWhat happened? Before long the Westminster village reverted to type, and began obsessing about political plots, obscure article wording, and parliamentary procedures. All the talk switched to meaningful votes \u2013 yet in vast stretches of the UK, what they want is meaningful lives.\nAnd amid the panic to stop Brexit, their stories have been forgotten. It often seems the message to them from remainers can be boiled down to two words: \u201cStupid northerners.\u201d\nThere\u2019s been little attempt to acknowledge the widespread poverty, deprivation, insecurity and marginalisation of so many towns and cities that led them to seek such a drastic solution to their problems. Yes, of course it\u2019s clear that all the predictions are for the economy to take a hit and the poorer, northern regions to take the biggest hit of all: \u201cWhat on earth were you thinking,\u201d the liberal commentariat say (it\u2019s a statement, not a question). Yet they fail to realise that these parts of the country have mostly been untouched by economic growth, even in the so-called boom years.\nI was born and raised in Hull, a medium-sized, solidly working-class city in east Yorkshire. I remember the Thatcher recession of the 1980s, and the hit the city took, along with the collapse of its fishing industry. I also remember feeling incredulous when the media, over the following years, reported the economic boom: the yuppies, the \u201cbig bang\u201d in the City of London, the \u201cshare-owning democracy\u201d. None of that was felt anywhere near us.\nAnd little has changed. The only two regions of the UK that have recovered after the 2008 crash are London and the south-east. So, during the referendum campaign, to raise the economy as a reason for staying in Europe was always likely to fall on deaf ears \u2013 and it did. Yet since 2016, remarkably, most remainers seem to feel that if they keep repeating this message, somehow people will change their minds. It won\u2019t work. Nor will that other continuously repeated phrase: \u201cYou were lied to.\u201d As if leave voters are so gullible they\u2019d believe anything politicians tell them: in fact, they voted Brexit because they totally distrusted politicians. All these remainer arguments do is make people feel their protest vote is being ignored, and that establishment voices just want things to carry on as before.\nThere\u2019s a great scene in James Graham\u2019s 2017 play Labour of Love, which centres on a Nottingham Labour MP and his constituency agent, played in its original production by Tamsin Greig. At the end of another long day pounding the streets, trying to show voters how her party can improve their lives, she says wistfully: \u201cWhat a glorious peace, it must be, to be on the Right. To wake up every morning and look around and think \u2013 yeah, this is pretty much how it should be.\u201d The same is true over the EU vote: working-class Brexiters could equally think, \u201cIt must be glorious being a remainer ...\u201d\nCertainly, few of them are likely to be persuaded by the leading voices in the people\u2019s vote campaign \u2013 almost all wealthy and middle class, and most of them southerners. The same is true of almost all remainer commentators in the media. The notion of the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d used to seem like a ridiculous putdown; yet, more and more, it seems to be becoming a truth. \u201cThe people have spoken. The people must be wrong,\u201d seems to be their mantra.\nAnd in the face of their impotence over changing hearts and minds, and as Theresa May drives on towards the cliff edge, they turn to the one person they know they can damage: Jeremy Corbyn.\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t Labour\u2019s leader help us and make all this nightmare end?\u201d they say. It is of little importance to them that Labour, as a national political party, has to listen to the voices of its northern voters; nor that Corbyn has, so far, played a tactically astute game.\nThey forget that in the general election of 2017, less than two years after becoming leader, he gained 3.5 million extra Labour votes (and 1.5 million more than David Cameron had for his majority government in 2015). Corbyn did this backing a soft Brexit. And he did this when there was a clear remain option on the ballot paper \u2013 in the form of the Lib Dems, whose vote bombed. Much as the Labour membership is clearly pro-EU, Corbyn\u2019s stance helped Labour in large parts of the country beyond the south-east \u2013 it held on to all three seats in Hull, a city that voted 68% leave. He correctly judged that, above all, people wanted to be listened to, and for the misery of austerity to end.\nOf course, this mattered little in the media world \u2013 dominated as it is by Oxbridge graduates, especially at its most senior levels. These are the people who have least to fear from austerity, and the most to lose from leaving Europe; nor do they have to worry about migrants moving in next door or changing their neighbourhoods, taking their jobs or undercutting their wages. To them, the concerns of poorer or working-class areas are irrational, merely evidence of their simple-mindedness. So the commentators demand Labour ditch all connection with its heartlands.\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be about tactics,\u201d they insist, \u201cit\u2019s about putting the country first.\u201d Yet, conveniently, they forget that Tony Blair used exactly the same strategy for humiliating and discrediting the John Major government during the 1990s. Blair stayed \u201cconstructively ambiguous\u201d over the big European questions of the day \u2013 Maastricht, and joining the euro \u2013 while the Tory prime minister was skewered by his eurosceptic \u201cbastards\u201d. The only significant difference to today is that the media establishment loved Blair (private school, Oxbridge, centrist \u2013 \u201cone of us\u201d), so they saw his manoeuvrings as the work of a genius. When, in an interview just before Christmas, Corbyn repeated the carefully crafted thinking behind his party\u2019s Brexit policy adopted just three months earlier, he was accused of \u201cdefying\u201d his membership. He\u2019s accused of secretly voting in favour of Brexit in 2016 (which goes to prove that you don\u2019t have to be a Trump supporter to believe fake news). And party members are urged to revolt against him.\nThey claim Corbyn is a hopeless leader. But if that was true, the whole Brexit issue would be playing out completely differently. Given May has shown herself to be totally out of her depth, any ambitious Tory leader-in-waiting (and there are several) would have taken her on by now, ousted her, and called a new general election to gain a solid majority and the chance to put through their own kind of Brexit deal.\nYet they haven\u2019t. Why not? Because they know Corbyn\u2019s message of ending austerity and taxing the rich still resonates. In fact it\u2019s Corbyn who\u2019s calling for an election, confident he can take his party to victory. And if he did, who knows what might happen over Brexit?\nCorbyn, unlike his liberal critics, understands that Brexit is a matter of timing. If you oppose it too soon, you\u2019ll be labelled as someone who never accepted the referendum result, showing contempt for the 17.4 million leave voters. When thousands took to the streets demanding a people\u2019s vote last summer, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that, up north, many leave voters would be digging their heels in even further.\nSomething dramatic has to happen before Labour changes the stance which proved so popular at the last election. The past few weeks have felt like the start of that drama: a dud deal; cabinet resignations; the withdrawal vote pulled at the last minute; a Tory leadership challenge; a parliament asserting itself over the government. In the following days there will be more such moments.\nIf May\u2019s deal is voted on and then defeated, everything will change.\nParadoxically, even if May gets her deal through, she will automatically lose the support of the DUP and therefore provide the very real prospect of the government losing a no-confidence motion. (So if Corbyn really was putting his party\u2019s interests above the country\u2019s, he\u2019d back May\u2019s deal and create this very scenario.)\nAssuming her deal is defeated, this would indeed be a moment for Corbyn to push for an election.\nAnd given the calamity of no-deal, which was certainly not on the side of any bus in 2016, it would also be a valid moment to call for a second referendum.\nEither of these options would provide the potential to alter Britain\u2019s current catastrophic trajectory. I\u2019d back them both. But if I had to choose between an election or a second referendum, I think that ultimately it would have to be for the option that could transform Britain \u2013 rather than the one under which things would remain just the same.\n Joseph Harker is a Guardian deputy opinion editor",

I didn\u2019t know anyone that had much money. I didn\u2019t go to college or university; no one around me did. Instead I found a junior office job and worked my way up.\nWhen I was 28 I decided that perhaps I was clever enough to do a degree and so I studied for a law degree through distance learning. I was awarded a high 2.2. It made me realise I could achieve more.\nI moved into investment banking but when my twin boys were born, I realised that although I was earning a lot of money, I wasn\u2019t very free \u2013 I was trapped working 80-hour weeks.\nHaving the twins made me realise that I would have to change the way I worked. I found a 9-5 job as a PA and started a wedding business on the side. I didn\u2019t have a huge passion for weddings; I just thought it sounded fun and something I\u2019d be good at. I liked organising and parties.\nBut I got into a lot of debt. I didn\u2019t know anything about business.

I started teaching them about online marketing and I suddenly thought, \u201cmaybe there\u2019s money in this\u201d. That was 22 months ago. I set myself up as a business coach and within six months I had made six figures by coaching others. I realised this was my passion.\nNow the revenue is about \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3500,000 a year but I spend most of it investing in myself and my company. I learn everything I can \u2013 I take Instagram and marketing courses, I have coaches \u2013 some costing as much as \u00a330,000, and the rest goes on marketing. This year I spent \u00a380,000 on coaching and self-improvement. From the business, I pay myself and my husband a salary of about \u00a380,000.\nIt has allowed my husband to retire from his 9-5 job and focus on our wedding business, and look after the kids, who are now seven. As for me, it means I can just work 9am-3pm four days a week, with 80% of the money I earn being passive income from courses and memberships.\nAs a result I spend more time travelling. During the summer, we took eight weeks off to travel around Europe with the kids. We visited Portugal, Malta, France and Italy. We probably spend at least \u00a32,000 a month on travel, sometimes more. In the summer we took a holiday on the biggest cruise ship in the world, and that set us back \u00a310,000. We\u2019ve visited 70 hotels across nine countries in the past 12 months.\nSome stays are gifted because of my social media following but most of the time we pay for it ourselves. We\u2019ve just booked to go to Disneyland Florida. We don\u2019t have expensive things \u2013 we have cars, but they\u2019re not flashy. I just care about experiences.\nSix months ago we sold our house in Surrey and moved to Hertfordshire. We pay about \u00a31,500 to rent a four-bedroom property in a tiny village. We have a big office and are able to work from home. We don\u2019t plan to buy a place for ourselves. I want to be a free spirit \u2013 I like to move a lot. Instead, we\u2019ll find a buy-to-let and invest in that.\nMy husband organises all the food shopping and spends about \u00a380 a week for the four of us. He\u2019ll look at the best deals \u2013 I\u2019m not like that at all. Our bills, which include Sky, come to about \u00a3800 a month.\nWhat we don\u2019t do is save. Because I come from a humble background and never had any money, I am a real believer in living in the moment. But this year I realise I need to start saving. I don\u2019t have a pension either, so I need to sort out some investing.\nThis year I\u2019d like to hit seven figures, but not if it means more time working. This year is about balance. But I\u2019ll definitely start saving more.",

        "content": "Give up the rat race, accept reality and have the courage to be disliked \u2013 the latest self-help trend is not about self-reinvention but finding contentment in the life you have\nBy tradition, this is the season for personal reinvention, but these days it\u2019s hard not to feel cynical about the idea of a triumphant liberation from the past. In the news, Brexit provides an hourly reminder that merely wishing to bring about a glorious fresh start is no guarantee that calamity won\u2019t be the result. Meanwhile, other dark developments \u2013 from the erosion of American democracy and the resurgence of the European far right, all the way to climate change \u2013 fuel a sense of foreboding that isn\u2019t exactly motivational when it comes to self-improvement: the creeping fear that you might be living in the end times is a poor basis for making a new beginning. In any case, the never-ending debate on nature versus nurture seems to be drifting toward a gloomy acceptance that there\u2019s much about ourselves we\u2019ll never change. \u201cDNA isn\u2019t all that matters,\u201d writes the geneticist Robert Plomin, whose book Blueprint epitomised this mood last year, \u201cbut it matters more than everything else put together in terms of the stable psychological traits that make us who we are.\u201d\nThen again, the self-reinvention narrative was always a bit suspect to begin with. For one thing, it\u2019s by no means clear that it\u2019s possible to transform yourself through the simple application of individual willpower: wherever you come down on nature and nurture, it\u2019s undeniable that we owe much of our success or failure in life to our circumstances, and to luck. Then there is the infuriating psychological quirk of \u201chedonic adaptation\u201d, otherwise known as the happiness treadmill. Succeed in improving your life, and the improvement will soon become part of the backdrop of your days, and thus cease delivering pleasure; to recover that sense of vitality and zest, you\u2019ll have to reinvent yourself again, ad infinitum.\nFinally, there\u2019s the conundrum that the self being reinvented is the same one that\u2019s doing the reinventing \u2013 so your existing flaws invariably get baked into your vision of the future. If you yearn to become, say, more productive or empathetic or physically fit in 2019, how do you know that very yearning isn\u2019t just another expression of your tendency to beat yourself up, which you\u2019d be better off addressing than indulging? Or suppose you plan to conquer your perfectionism: how will you avoid getting all perfectionistic about that? There are no completely fresh starts, there is no year zero. You\u2019re already hopelessly ensnared in the only life you\u2019ll ever get.\nIn response to the prevailing mood, there has been a noticeable change of tone in the world of self-help, a publishing genre historically dedicated to promising massive, near-effortless transformation overnight, or in a couple of weeks at most. For a while now, that hyperbole has been losing ground to a spirit of anti-utopianism \u2013 of accepting yourself as you are, building a good-enough life, or just protecting yourself from the worst of the world outside. Adult colouring books are the most easily mockable manifestation of this urge. But it\u2019s detectible, too, in the unceasing stream of Scandinavian lifestyle concepts \u2013 hygge, lagom, and the rest \u2013 with their focus on hunkering down and getting cosy; and in the ongoing rediscovery of Stoic philosophy and the championing of \u201cresilience\u201d as techniques for enduring life\u2019s blows.\nAnd it\u2019s everywhere present, this time around, in the phase of the publishing calendar irritatingly known as \u201cNew Year, New You\u201d. One thought-provoking example is a new edition of Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdat, formerly a senior executive with Google X, the search giant\u2019s secretive research and development arm. Generally speaking, the notion that \u201chappiness is an engineering problem\u201d is one to distrust. But Gawdat, far from championing the tech multimillionaire lifestyle as the only one worth aiming for, writes movingly of having achieved it, only to discover its emptiness. And he has endured far worse, losing his 21-year-old son Ali as a result of complications during routine surgery.\nAt the core of Gawdat\u2019s \u201cformula for happiness\u201d is the venerable observation that happiness equals reality minus expectations: in order to feel distress because your life is lacking something, you must first have had some expectation of attaining that thing. (My life lacks a 70ft yacht, but this causes me no suffering, because I never imagined I\u2019d have one.) The argument is not, as progressive critics of self-help sometimes imagine, that disadvantaged people need only stop expecting anything better in order to be content. Some expectations \u2013 a reasonable standard of living, healthcare, fulfilling work, social connection \u2013 may be entirely rational. But seeing the truth of the formula acts as a kind of sieve, allowing you to separate the handful of things you genuinely want from life from those you\u2019ve been socialised into believing you should want. The latter aren\u2019t worth the pursuit \u2013 and if they are the reason you\u2019re trying to invent a \u201cnew you\u201d, you\u2019re better off sticking with the old one.\n\u00b6\nOne of the most rigorous articulations of the new mood of acceptance is Happy Ever After: Escaping the Myth of the Perfect Life by Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the LSE and, the publicity material explains, \u201can internationally renowned expert in human behaviour and happiness\u201d. His book is a persuasive demolition of many of our cultural stories about how we ought to live, including the idea that there\u2019s anything particularly desirable about being a senior academic or a renowned expert. In fact, his data suggests, pursuing education beyond the age of 18 is unlikely to make much positive difference to the pleasure or sense of purpose you experience in life: on average, after secondary school, \u201chappiness decreases as education increases\u201d.\nAs Dolan concedes, it can be notoriously hard to pin down the direction of causation in wellbeing research: it could be that gloomier people are more prone to doing university degrees, rather than that degrees make people gloomy. Yet either way, the belief that more education equals more fulfilment is a clear example of what he calls a \u201cnarrative trap\u201d \u2013 a socially imposed message about the ideal life that doesn\u2019t match real experience. This ideal often ends up doing more harm than good, either by propelling people into lives they don\u2019t enjoy, or by wrongly convincing those who don\u2019t make the grade that they are missing out on a more satisfying existence. Another trap is the belief that higher-status jobs reliably bring more satisfaction (in fact, florists are generally much happier than lawyers), or that a larger income necessarily buys more happiness (it does, but only up to about \u00a350,000 a year; beyond that, tasks related to earning more money squeeze out more enjoyable ones).\nThese sorts of findings are increasingly well known, but where Dolan excels is in drawing attention to how stubbornly we resist their implications. If happiness and a sense of purpose are your goals in life, then a \u201cgood job\u201d or education or salary that fails to deliver them isn\u2019t really \u201cgood\u201d in any meaningful sense of the word \u2013 which makes it a strange thing to strive for, or to encourage your children to strive for. Oh, and speaking of children, the evidence is that parenthood won\u2019t make you happier, either. (It does boost people\u2019s sense of purpose, although apparently not more than various other things.) Likewise the dedicated pursuit of physical fitness, which turns out to lead to less happiness than you\u2019d think. And marriage: it\u2019s true that married people tell researchers they are happier than when they were single, but only if their husband or wife is present in the room during the interview.\nWhat makes Happy Ever After somewhat radical, at least by the standards of popular psychology, is its recognition that these narrative traps aren\u2019t simply inexplicable mistakes we happen to make, but the products of ideology. They may not serve us, but they certainly serve the system in which we find ourselves embedded. The pursuit of wealth or social mobility might not bring happiness, but it does fuel economic growth \u2013 while marriage, parenthood, fitness and the rest keep the whole operation running smoothly into the next generation. Dolan focuses on how uniquely detrimental such messages can be for children from working-class families. Stereotypes about appropriate accents and lifestyles may deter them from going to university at all; those who make it into middle-class professions then face self-consciousness and insecurity about fitting in. Dolan, raised \u201clower working class\u201d in east London, writes that he still struggles with the cultural codes of academia: \u201cI weight train with bodybuilders. Seeing a blazer or a pair of loafers at a bodybuilding competition is as rare as rocking-horse shit.\u201d\nThe new crop of anti-perfectionist self-help books are an important counterweight to the conventional message of self-reinvention, which is that there\u2019s no point at which it makes sense to be satisfied with your situation and finally relax, since you could always benefit from acquiring more money, status, education, and so on. What\u2019s less clear is whether this humbler kind of advice is any easier to implement, on a practical level, than the old sort. Apart from anything else, our narratives about the perfect life aren\u2019t just beliefs we can choose to jettison by a mere act of will, after reading about research that refutes them. They are deeply entrenched in the culture, reinforced by the media, inculcated in us as small children, not to mention in our genes. (There are some obvious evolutionary advantages to constantly craving more resources, and never feeling as if what you\u2019ve got is sufficient.) Moreover, no research finding about the average happiness of the general population can decisively prove that a given lifestyle choice is the right or wrong one for you, with all your idiosyncrasies. One chapter in Happy Ever After gamely makes the case for polyamorous relationships as a path to increased happiness, but whatever your reaction to that prospect \u2013 thrilling erotic adventure, or indescribable hassle? \u2013 it\u2019s not clear that you should try to override it based on the results of academic studies.\nThere\u2019s another, more mind-bending problem with using this kind of research to direct personal change, which is that many such transitions are what the philosopher LA Paul calls \u201ctransformative experiences\u201d: they turn you into a person so different that you\u2019re unable, from the vantage point of the present, to imagine what that future person will make of them. To pick the most obvious example, becoming a parent might transform you into the kind of person who adores having children, even if beforehand you weren\u2019t. But it might just as easily work the other way, turning someone enthusiastic about the prospect into the kind who\u2019d never have chosen to do so.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s psychologically freeing to be reminded that there is no single path to satisfaction \u2013 and that if circumstances or personal preferences disbar you from following the herd, you still have a good shot at fulfilment. \u201cQuite a lot of what passes itself off as dialogue about our society,\u201d the essayist Tim Kreider has written, \u201cconsists of people trying to justify their choices as the only right or natural ones by denouncing others\u2019 as selfish or pathological or wrong. So it\u2019s easy to overlook that hidden behind all this smug certainty is a poignant insecurity, and the naked 3am terror of regret.\u201d Much of the time, when it comes to building a meaningful life, you\u2019re flying blind. But the comforting truth is that so is everyone else.\n\u00b6\nThen again, judging by its continued dominance of the self-help shelves, you\u2019d be forgiven for concluding that the key to a perfect life was indisputable: lots and lots of Buddhist (or at least Buddhist-inspired) meditation. This is ironic, since Buddhism embodies one of the earliest confrontations with the truth about the perfectionist standards by which we judge the world and ourselves \u2013 that this is a recipe for permanent dissatisfaction. The basic situation, Buddha famously said, is that life is suffering. Everything is impermanent; old age, sickness and death are our inescapable human fate. And your philosophy of happiness had better acknowledge these realities, otherwise the only possible result is even more suffering, for you and everyone around you.\nWhile he probably wouldn\u2019t put it so bluntly, this is the spirit that imbues a new work by the South Korean Zen writer and former monk Haemin Sunim, Love for Imperfect Things: How to Be Kind and Forgiving Toward Yourself and Others. In these snark-saturated times, it\u2019s cheering that a voice as quietly friendly as Haemin\u2019s can make you a mega-celebrity: he has a combined social media following of around 2 million people, plus a previous global bestseller, The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down. (In Seoul, where he lives, he presides over a Zen-infused therapy centre, the School for Broken Hearts, but the primary vehicle for his teaching is Twitter.)\nHaemin is especially eloquent on life\u2019s smaller dissatisfactions, and how they can sometimes be trickier to deal with than the bigger, more dramatic ones. For example, though it\u2019s a good thing that we talk so much more openly today about mental illness, one perverse consequence is that it can actually be easier to admit to a serious depression than to a milder, pervasive sense of disappointment in life. \u201cUnlike other emotions, disappointment is very tricky to express: it comes out as petty and small-minded,\u201d Haemin writes; it also tends to sound like you\u2019re blaming other people for failing to measure up. Yet of course it\u2019s a far more widespread problem than severe suffering. It has been argued that Buddha\u2019s observation that \u201clife is suffering\u201d might be more accurately translated as something like \u201clife is bothersome\u201d. (With luck, extreme agony will be very infrequent in your life, but a background sense of things being not quite right may be truly close to universal.) The first step towards relieving this kind of discontent, Haemin suggests, is to recognise the untenability of the demand that you, or anyone you encounter, should demonstrate perfection to begin with. Much of the bothersomeness of daily life arises not from circumstances themselves, but from the insistence that they ought to be other than they are.\nHaving not yet attained Haemin\u2019s tolerance for other people\u2019s flaws, I can\u2019t resist observing that his wisdom all too often comes across as platitudinous. The book\u2019s prose passages are interspersed with sections laid out as blank verse, inadvertently demonstrating that mundane reflections aren\u2019t transformed into profundities merely by centring them on the page and inserting a few line breaks. (A typical example: \u201cIf someone did not ask for your help, / do not try to solve her problem for her. / Though your intentions may be good, / You risk taking control away from her / and injuring her self-esteem.\u201d) Still, he\u2019s not wrong. And behind the sporadic banality lurks a bracingly hard-headed world view: reality is what it is, and a lot of unnecessary misery arises from demanding that things shouldn\u2019t be the way that \u2013 as a matter of stubborn fact \u2013 they are. This is not a counsel of resignation; having accepted the reality of your situation, it may well be appropriate to try to change it. But not denying how things stand is the essential first step. Or, as the psychotherapist Carl Rogers put it: \u201cThe curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.\u201d\nIronically, if not very surprisingly, the wellbeing industry has proved adept at turning this new spirit of modesty and acceptance into another expensive consumerist pursuit. Those Scandinavian \u201csecrets of happiness\u201d are a case in point: \u201chygge\u201d may evoke contented relaxation around a familiar fireplace with old friends, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t spend almost \u00a3200 on a specially hygge-appropriate plant-dyed pillow, or \u00a380 on a set of candle holders, at the website hyggelife.com. (And while \u201clagom\u201d may mean \u201cjust the right amount\u201d in Swedish, there are at least six recent books in English on the subject, which isn\u2019t just the right amount, but too many.) Your effort to become the sort of person who finds happiness in what they already have can easily become its own interminable quest, in which success \u2013 and therefore happiness \u2013 always lies in some fantasy of the future, rather than in the here and now.\nAs always, this is capitalism\u2019s fault. But most of us are complicit: we chase unattainable fantasies of self\u2011reinvention, rather than confronting reality, at least in part because life is easier that way. This is one of the lessons of an absorbing recent addition to the anti-perfectionist self-help subgenre, The Courage to Be Disliked, by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, published in English last year. (By then, it had reportedly already sold more than 3.5m copies in the original Japanese and other translations.) Despite all the \u201cnew Japanese phenomenon\u201d marketing \u2013 the book was described by one critic as \u201cMarie Kondo, but for your brain\u201d \u2013 it is primarily an accessible exploration of the work of the Austrian psychotherapist Alfred Adler. He held that we frequently cling to our problems, no matter how much we complain about them and claim we want to eradicate them, because overcoming them necessitates an encounter with fear. It can be easier to locate fulfilment \u2013 and fulfilment in intimate relationships above all \u2013 in the future, where we never quite have to do what it takes to attain it, rather than run the interpersonal risks involved in trying to achieve it now.\nThe problem, as Kishimi and Koga make clear, is that this only makes for more suffering in the present, by systematically biasing you towards taking the kind of actions that postpone, rather than build, a meaningful life. In this way, fantasies of total self-transformation don\u2019t simply fail, they also block change of the more modest \u2013 but real \u2013 kind. And in any case, the future never seems to arrive: the truth is that the present is the only time it\u2019ll ever be possible to make a change. Transformative self-reinvention may be an overoptimistic dream, but defeatism about change is its own kind of false comfort, too: both are forms of absolutism that serve to justify passivity. We will fail to reinvent ourselves this January, or next month, or next January, or ever. But once we finally get that fact into our heads, we might at last be able to start making a few improvements.",

        "content": "The Guardian\u2019s restaurant critic explains how a hot date nearly ruined naan for her, how she balances her career with veganism, and what she would choose as her desert island dish\nHow did you start writing about food?\nMy first review was in about 1998 for Marie Claire magazine. The restaurant is still there and I loved it. I wanted to write about food and have a column from that point but they\u2019re not the kind of jobs you come across easily. You have to pretty much wait for someone to die or give up because they\u2019ve got gout. People carry on as long as they can because it\u2019s the greatest job in the world. Before I started reviewing for the London Evening Standard in 2012, I spent years wanting to be a critic so that I could purge all the things in my head about bad restaurants and good restaurants, but mainly bad ones.\nDo you eat out every night?\nNo. I tend to hit restaurants in batches over two to three days, and eat and take notes. Last night, I was at a place in north London. Today, I\u2019m going to write my column about a restaurant in Edinburgh, then go to one in Covent Garden and a brasserie in the West End. I have a space where I really eat and then I try to counteract it by living really cleanly for, say, 48 hours, 72 hours. It\u2019s the only way that works for me. During the down period, I exercise a lot and I live, try to be as good as I can.\nIn London alone, there are about 230 openings a year and I am invited to all of them. If I wanted to go and eat the food there for free, I could although that\u2019s an ethical problem. I book anonymously everywhere I go, which is hard because they find out the names all the time, I pay for the meal myself then claim it back from the Guardian. I spend as much as an average person would at dinner - I don\u2019t go mad. It\u2019s a normal experience, so far as it can be. You have to be really strategic in eating as a critic because your body doesn\u2019t really belong to you any more: it belongs to the newspaper. You\u2019ve got to get the food into you at some time to write the column but if you were to eat everything that came your way, it would be the end of you.\nIs it impossible to eat without mentally reviewing the food?\nYes. It\u2019s impossible even when I\u2019m really trying. My mind is always subconsciously trying to work out why this food isn\u2019t up to standard. Is it stale? Has it been made without love and without the right seasoning? And why is a restaurant not staffed properly? It takes over your life so I enjoy eating at home because there\u2019s a calmness about that.\nI took my mother for afternoon tea at a hotel in the Lake District the other day and I just wanted to treat her to a lovely experience but I was writing a furious column in my head from the moment we walked in. The greeting, the lack of greeting, the general atmosphere from the staff, that they\u2019re bored to see me and so on.\nIt\u2019s difficult to go out eating with me socially because once I\u2019ve noticed things, my antennae are on. My friends never cook for me. When they\u2019re tipsy, they invite me to dinner then, in the cold light of day, they panic and always book a restaurant. I\u2019m rarely ever invited to people\u2019s houses to eat. It\u2019s a lovely idea until they wake up then they wriggle out of it.\nWhat have been your best dinners?\nI always remember the bad experiences because I have hundreds of great dinners. I once went on a hot date with a hot actor to what was one of London\u2019s hottest restaurants and once we\u2019d ordered he announced that he was actually seeing someone else but of course then I couldn\u2019t stand up and leave. I had to eat about seven courses of incredible world-class Indian food through absolute gritted teeth. And I remember thinking there are thousands of people across London who would kill for this bespoke naan and I am bloody going to eat it.\nYou\u2019re pretty much vegan. How does that affect your reviewing?\nWhen I was a little girl I always enjoyed the roast potatoes and the vegetables at Sunday dinner more than the meat. I was always incredibly aware what meat is. I\u2019m a massive animal lover so the glorification of meat doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I don\u2019t get upset if people eat it around me. When I\u2019m reviewing, I always have someone with me who eats meat. I don\u2019t generally ever order meat; they always do. I will have a bit of theirs and I can tell straightaway if it\u2019s good or rubbish. I don\u2019t have to force myself \u2013 I\u2019m not gagging when I eat it - because I don\u2019t think meat tastes horrible. One of the cruellest tricks is how absolutely delicious lamb is. In my own time, I eat vegan or vegetarian. I really abhor factory farming and its byproducts so I live a vegan lifestyle as much as I can. If you come to my house you are getting oat milk, vegan cheeses and things like that. I am always walking into restaurants and making them paranoid that they are not catering to people of different appetites and I think that I am a force for good in that way.\nWhat would be your desert island dish?\nIt would be something carb-laden and full of calories because I\u2019m going to finally put on as much weight as I\u2019d like to if I wasn\u2019t on HDTV in people\u2019s living rooms. It would be chef Romy Gill\u2019s samosa chaat \u2013 fried, chopped-up samosas with chickpeas, sweet chutneys and yoghurt. It\u2019s a big, crunchy, chunky bowl. It\u2019s delicious. She would just keep bringing me that.\nWhat\u2019s the most important thing you try to convey in reviews?\nIs the restaurant worth going to? That\u2019s it for me. I\u2019m not writing for a small number of London food-scene tastemakers. I write my Guardian column for people all over Britain who may go out two or three times a year because they have families and a limited budget, and I want that experience to be amazing for them and not a rip-off. I write for people who are looking for places to take their spouse for an anniversary or somewhere to propose or somewhere to save their relationship. I also want to convey what restaurants are like for people who may never get to go to them. I think those people want to know what it feels like to be in there. The food world is very funny \u2013 unintentionally often \u2013 and I want to make people laugh or cheer them up every Saturday morning.\nWhat\u2019s the best thing about your job?\nWhen I review a rural pub, say, outside London for Feast, then I hear that they have been booked out for months ahead and they\u2019ve had to take on more staff from the local area. You realise that you\u2019ve really made an impact on that community and you can change people\u2019s lives. It feels amazing but you\u2019ve got a massive responsibility sometimes.\nAre you ever wrong?\nLooking back at reviews I sometimes know that I was in an incredibly bad mood and taking my horrible day with me, so the fact that the service and the food were terrible meant that I was probably harsher than I could have been. However, was I wrong? No, you\u2019re never wrong. I don\u2019t make up that things are bad. When I\u2019ve given a stinking review, it\u2019s because those things happened. I don\u2019t look back at any place that I have annihilated and go, actually now I think about it, that was a wonderful meal.\nHow do you think of the restaurants around Britain?\nBefore Feast, when I wrote about restaurants at the London Evening Standard for five years, I definitely became convinced that the only good food in Britain was in the capital. When I came to the Guardian, I was determined to spend half my time going right through Britain, to prove myself wrong and to take up the advice of readers and of people that I met along the way. After my first year, I admit I was a complete idiot to think there wasn\u2019t great food outside London. It does new and trend-setting but there are incredible places across the country. My greatest meals in 2018 have been in places like Moseley, Edinburgh and the Lake District. One of my favourite places to be at the moment is Bristol and I love Manchester - it\u2019s really exciting.\nWhat do you think of food crazes?\nFood fads are the bane of the critic\u2019s life because you\u2019re served the same thing again and again. Food predictions are arbitrary things that people have decided will be cool next year, like some super seed is in and another one is out. They\u2019re just ridiculous. But as a writer who likes to make people laugh, they\u2019re an absolute gift.\nA food trend I\u2019d like to see the back of is the never-ending tasting menu. I looked at the menu of a restaurant near Brighton recently and they do a 19-course tasting menu for \u00a3180 or something. I think there may be a 14-course one if you beg for clemency. It said that to enjoy the full experience please allow three to four hours for dinner, we seat everyone at 7 but meet us at 6 o\u2019clock at the bar for a drink. I\u2019ve had relationships that haven\u2019t lasted as long as that. You\u2019re literally moving in with all your fellow diners and the staff for an entire evening. No.",

        "content": "Creator and star says he will never forget reception of musical in parents\u2019 homeland\nLin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s return to the stage in his musical, Hamilton, was brought to a dramatic standstill on Friday night \u2013 not by protests in his parents\u2019 homeland of Puerto Rico, as some had feared, but by a spontaneous eruption of cheers, whoops and applause.\nThe brightest spotlight shone on Miranda as, reprising the title role for the first time since Broadway in July 2016, he sang his introductory line: \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d. He got no further. The audience of nearly 2,000 rose to its feet and generated a wall of joyous noise for half a minute. The music stopped and Miranda remained motionless, keeping his eyes fixed straight ahead, then finally allowing them to dart about the stage.\n\u201cI have never felt anything like that,\u201d he said at a post-show press conference in which he toggled rapidly between English and Spanish. \u201cIt\u2019s like performing to outer space. \u2018Alexander Hamilton\u2019 \u2013 pwhaaaaaah! I didn\u2019t see anyone standing; I just felt it. It was the first time I felt a cheer. I felt my hair move because of a cheer and I will never forget it.\u201d\nThe show resumed and continued to thrill the audience, who again delivered a standing ovation at the curtain call. Wiping away tears, Miranda told the audience: \u201cMiracles happened to make this night happen.\u201d He was joined on stage by his father, Luis Miranda, who was 18 when he moved from Puerto Rico to New York, where Miranda was born and raised. Luis praised his \u201cgenius son\u201d and the pair embraced.\nMiranda then produced a Puerto Rican flag, waved it above his head and wrapped himself in it as he left the stage, earning more whistles and cheers. He told reporters: \u201cI just love this island so much and I just want it to be proud of me.\u201d\nHamilton was starting a two-week run expected to raise thousands of dollars for artists and cultural groups struggling in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, killing nearly 3,000 people, knocking out power for months and causing widespread devastation.\nAlexander Hamilton \u2013 whose 262nd birthday fell on Friday \u2013 himself fled a Caribbean island after a hurricane and went on to become one of America\u2019s founding fathers and first treasury secretary. The musical includes a song, Hurricane, which contains the lyrics: \u201cWhen I was 17 a hurricane/ Destroyed my town/ I didn\u2019t drown/ I couldn\u2019t seem to die.\u201d\nMiranda told reporters: \u201cIt was very hard to sing that here in Puerto Rico because you know better than I what it is to survive a hurricane. I feel like I\u2019m going back to Maria a little bit every time I sing it. I\u2019ve never felt that doing the show before. That\u2019s unexpectedly emotional. I didn\u2019t get through it the first time I did it on stage.\u201d\nThe composer and lyricist was also asked about reports that Donald Trump is exploring the possibility of diverting money from disaster funds, including that assigned to Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery, to border wall construction. \u201cI think that\u2019s absolutely monstrous,\u201d Miranda replied.\nHamilton was initially going to be staged at the University of Puerto Rico but producers announced in December that it was moving to the Luis A Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center after university staff and students threatened to hold protests over budget cuts to coincide with the show. Miranda explained that his conscience would not allow \u201cthe slightest chance that anything would go wrong\u201d. Audience members went through airport-style metal detectors on a night that went smoothly except for long toilet queues.\nTicket-holders ranged from VIPs and those who had forked out $5,000 to winners of a lottery that offers 275 tickets for every performance at $10 each.\nLiz Mari, 30, an optician, had wanted a Hamilton ticket for her 30th birthday on Thursday. Her husband tried and failed, but then they got lucky in the lottery. \u201cI wanted to cry,\u201d she said of the moment she found out. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to New York to try and see it and couldn\u2019t get a ticket, so to see it now on our island is amazing. This is the first time we can actually see a Broadway show in Puerto Rico.\u201d\nDoris Pellicier, 61, a bank manager, was similarly euphoric: \u201cI called my husband: \u2018Wow! Wow! I won, I can\u2019t believe it!\u2019\u201d Her husband, Eric Perez, 65, a vice-president of a hospital group, added: \u201cWe wanted to see it because it\u2019s a great musical and Lin-Manuel Miranda is Puerto Rican. People here are very proud of what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nAnother audience member, Kari Hernandez, 32, admitted: \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier in my life than at this moment! It is super-inspiring to see this here in this environment and at this time. It feels a little bit extra special: a lot of the messaging resonates. Puerto Rico is struggling in a lot of ways and it\u2019s a good time for inspiration.\u201d\nA British Hamilton fan was in attendance, too. Matthew Lumby, 46, a civil servant from Islington, north London, had seen the show six times already but paid $300 for a ticket plus air fare. \u201cI saw Lin-Manuel Miranda do it in the early days on Broadway,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d get the chance again. He brings his own idiosyncrasies to the role; he does his own little dances. It\u2019s funny to see him deliver the words he wrote. He can do it like no one else.\u201d\nAt an after-show party, where musicians played and the Hamilton logo was combined with the Puerto Rican flag on a giant screen, Miranda was trailed by an eager crowd snapping photos on their phones. He climbed on stage and said: \u201cMy heart is so full. It is not every day you get to bring everyone you love to the island you most love in the world.\u201d",

        "content": "With Westminster gridlocked, Nigel Farage has spent the past four months mobilising his troops at Leave Means Leave rallies around the country\nA huge queue snakes around Bolton Wanderers football club, but this is no regular Saturday. These supporters are here for a political rally. It is mid-September 2018, and Leave Means Leave has just started a tour of Brexit Britain. This cross-party pressure group was formed in 2016 to ensure a \u201cclean Brexit\u201d \u2013 in other words, a hard one. Now, with Brexit looking anything but clean, it has decided to step things up. Half a dozen rallies have been announced, and the organisers promise this is only the start.\nOutside the ground, people stand next to an open-topped Leave Means Leave battle bus to take selfies. Its colour scheme echoes that of the European Union flag, but with an extra fizz \u2013 blue and orange, instead of blue and yellow. The rally is sold out and takes place in a conference centre adjoining the stadium. It is packed with more than a thousand people, most of them middle-aged and elderly. On every seat, there is a little welcome pack for those who have paid their \u00a35.98 to attend: a Stop The Brexit Betrayal banner, a Believe In Britain pen, a union jack flag.\nLeave Means Leave\u2019s chairman, John Longworth, is the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, while its founder and vice chair, Richard Tice, is CEO of the asset management group Quidnet Capital. They make for impressive frontmen \u2013 Longworth with his record in business, Tice with his Dr Kildare good looks. Longworth tells the audience that, wherever he has worked, he has had a direct link to Brussels. \u201cI knew more than most people how the European Union worked. I knew what they were up to, and that\u2019s why I voted to leave.\u201d\nBut nobody is here to listen to him. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the next person needs little introduction,\u201d Tice begins. \u201cHe is one of the original Brexiteers. He has slowly but surely changed the course of British political history, and he, without question, will go down as one of the most significant political figures in the last 50 or 60 years\u2026 He has survived plane crashes that would have killed most people because he is a true patriot, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d\nNigel Farage walks down the centre of the room and it feels as if the sea has parted. He holds his hands aloft as the faithful roar him on, a messiah without portfolio. While he has never been an MP, it is hard to argue with Tice\u2019s proposition that he is one of Britain\u2019s most influential politicians. At a time when rightwing politics are sweeping the world, Farage is the closest thing we have to a Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n or Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 a populist insurgent. In 2016, while the mainstream parties encouraged the British public to remain in Europe, he mobilised 17.4 million people to vote leave. Now, after two years away, Farage has returned to the frontline \u2013 and he is furious that the \u201cpolitical class\u201d is trying to thwart the will of the people. If he is denied the Brexit he spent a quarter of a century battling for, where will he take the fight next?\nWhen he speaks, Farage makes it clear that his is a reluctant return. He could be making squillions in the City, or breaking bread with Trump, rather than addressing the Brexiters of Bolton. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to do this again,\u201d he tells the crowd. \u201cI thought we\u2019d won on June 23 2016, in what was the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this nation. We voted to leave, and I thought our politicians would deliver. Well, they haven\u2019t. So you know what, we\u2019re back and we\u2019ll fight them again!\u201d\nTwo days before the rally, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, posted a photograph on Instagram of himself offering Theresa May a selection of cakes, accompanied by the caption: \u201cA piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.\u201d It was a reference to an earlier speech he had given, arguing that the prime minister could not cherrypick areas of the single market as Britain leaves the EU. Farage is apoplectic about this slight, which he sees as typical of the arrogance of the EU. His message is simple: no Eurocrat has the right to ridicule a British prime minister, however inept.\nHe takes us back to the greatest day of his life. \u201cLet\u2019s remind ourselves what actually happened on June 23 2016, what happened despite the big political parties, despite the big companies, despite the big banks, despite big global politics, including of course President Obama coming to our country\u201d \u2013 \u201cBoooo!\u201d shout the crowd \u2013 \u201cto tell us what we should do. Despite the threats of disaster. Do you remember? From George Osborne there was going to be an emergency budget\u2026 They almost told us that if we dared to vote leave, a plague of black locusts would descend on our land. And despite all those threats, we voted to leave. We voted, folks, for independence.\u201d\nHe says it is now up to Leave Means Leave supporters to ensure that Brexit is not betrayed. \u201cThe vast majority of our politicians want to dilute it, suspend it, overturn it. And one or two former senior politicians like Tony Blair\u201d \u2013 \u201cBoooo!\u201d \u201cLock him up!\u201d \u2013 \u201cdo not want to give us Brexit.\u201d\nFarage foments the crowd with consummate skill. As he reaches a climax, every word becomes a sentence. \u201cWith Mrs May\u2019s Chequers plan, the very best we would get is Brexit. In. Name. Only. And. That. Is. Not. Good. Enough. Is it?\u201d It may be pantomime, but his anger is visceral. The language is clever and deliberate. Like his friend Trump, Farage is careful to distance himself from the political class. He might still be a member of the European parliament, but he is not One of Them. He is here to fight for the Everyman and the Everywoman, struggling to make themselves heard in a world dominated by globalisation and liberal elites.\nIn June 2016, Farage was less subtle. He posed in front of that notorious Ukip poster with the slogan Breaking Point: The EU Has Failed Us All, showing hundreds of refugees, most of them non-white, crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015. The poster was reported to police for inciting racial hatred, and even Farage\u2019s fellow Brexiter Michael Gove said it made him \u201cshudder\u201d.\nSince then, Farage\u2019s frame of reference has become more coded. Blair, Obama, the BBC, London: he doesn\u2019t need to say much more than this to generate a boo from his followers \u2013 just the name, the institution, the city is enough. It\u2019s dog-whistle politics on a new level, although the crowd occasionally give him away: at a mention of London, an audience member heckles, \u201cThey\u2019re all foreigners in London!\u201d\nNow 54, Farage is in many ways a throwback to a Britannia that ruled the waves, when men and women were addressed as ladies and gentlemen, and prejudices were hidden behind tight smiles. There is a nihilistic sentimentality to his politics; his Britain is one where we still happily smoke our way to cancer and drink ourselves silly before lunch \u2013 because no bloody bureaucrat, least of all a European, is going to tell us what\u2019s good for us. But beneath the patriot-next-door persona, Farage has changed in many ways \u2013 in his language, his alliances, his status across the world. As Ukip has become increasingly irrelevant (membership was down from 39,000 in July 2016 to 23,600 in August 2018), Farage\u2019s global influence has grown.\nHis friendships now cross continents, but they tend to be with white, male, rightwing populists: Trump, Steve Bannon or Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Last April, Farage tweeted his support for Orb\u00e1n, who has been accused of Islamophobia and antisemitism, calling him \u201cthe strongest leader in Europe and the EU\u2019s biggest nightmare\u201d. The pair share an antipathy towards the Jewish Hungarian investor and philanthropist George Soros, who has given away much of his vast fortune through the Open Society foundation, \u201cto build vibrant and tolerant democracies\u201d. In June, Farage told Fox News: \u201cSoros is actively encouraging people to come across the Mediterranean, to flood Europe\u2026 Thank goodness Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Hungary have got the confidence to stand up against him\u2026 If you criticise Soros, his media friends accuse you of being an antisemite. It is quite extraordinary. I really feel that Soros in many ways is the biggest danger to the entire western world.\u201d\nToday\u2019s rally in Bolton is coming to an end, and Tice asks everybody to wave their flags and placards, and to make as big a noise as possible. \u201cStand up and let the world see that we believe in Britain, and we want to stop the Brexit betrayal!\u201d The room cheers as one.\n\u201cGod bless Great Britain!\u201d shouts a voice from the back of the hall.\nI start to feel self-conscious. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wave your flag?\u201d says the man next to me.\nOn the way out, I meet a woman dressed in floral pinks and purples. Joan Johnson was chair of Bolton Ukip, until she defected back to the Tories after Britain voted to leave; like many Ukip members, she felt the party had served its purpose. But she\u2019s still a Farage fan. Is he Britain\u2019s greatest populist politician? \u201cYes, I think he is.\u201d What does it mean to be a great populist? \u201cIt means he\u2019s a good leader. He\u2019s very outspoken, and he tells the truth. He is popular and he is populist, in that he\u2019s a leader of the people.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a typical politician,\u201d adds Diane Parkinson, Johnson\u2019s friend and another former Ukip activist. \u201cThere\u2019s no diplomacy, no sitting on the fence. He\u2019s an outcast.\u201d Farage has this in common with other successful populists \u2013 an ability to portray himself as the outsider: little David with a fag in one hand and a pint of bitter in the other, kicking out at the all-powerful Goliath.\nBolton is an ethnically diverse city; in 2011, 20% of its population did not identify as white British. Yet everybody here today appears to be white. \u201cYes, I noticed that,\u201d Johnson says, before adding that there is no tension between the city\u2019s white and Asian populations. She does not believe relationships between Bolton\u2019s Asian and European migrants are as harmonious. \u201cA lot of the Indians and Pakistanis have their own businesses and they work hard at it. But then you\u2019ve got your people from eastern Europe coming in, perhaps also wanting to set up businesses, and there are fights.\u201d\n\u201cToo many cultures,\u201d Parkinson says. \u201cThe eastern Europeans saw an opportunity to come over. I\u2019d do the same. It\u2019s all about survival. They\u2019re taking low-paid jobs, but the British people don\u2019t want those low-paid jobs because they\u2019ve got the benefits system to fall back on.\u201d\nOn the bus back to Manchester, I meet Alexa Michael, a Conservative councillor for Beckenham in London. \u201cNigel says what a lot of ordinary people are thinking but are too frightened to say,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s got the common touch, even though he\u2019s got quite a posh background. It\u2019s no surprise that people in Bolton, the old mill towns, what you might call working-class areas, were more inclined to vote leave than some of the more prosperous areas.\u201d\nAnd yet the Bolton audience more closely resembled her \u2013 smartly dressed, very middle class \u2013 not the working-class voters we are often told Farage appeals to.\nIt\u2019s a week later, and the battlebus has moved on to Birmingham\u2019s National Conference Centre. Again the event is sold out and the 1,000-strong crowd is every bit as white and grey as Bolton\u2019s. A dozen miles away, the Conservative party is holding its annual conference. \u201cI want you to make a big noise today,\u201d Longworth tells the audience, \u201cnot least because we want those people down the road to hear you.\u201d\nTice takes over, to drum home the purpose of the meeting. \u201cWe know why we\u2019re here, don\u2019t we? We want to send a very simple message that they should just Chuck Chequers.\u201d Chuck Chequers; No Deal? No Problem; Leave Means Leave: the leavers have both the simplest arguments and the strongest soundbites.\nHe makes a joke about the battlebus. \u201cWe had such fun deciding how big a number we were going to put on the bus.\u201d This is a reference to the \u00a3350m Boris Johnson emblazoned on his Vote Leave bus, the sum we were meant to be saving on EU membership and spending on the NHS every week (he had not accounted for rebates, grants and subsidies). \u201cI was all for putting \u2018Save \u00a339bn\u2019!\u201d Tice says. He pauses to let the audience laugh. \u201cUnbelievably, I was outvoted \u2013 but I believe in democracy.\u201d Thirty nine billion pounds is now the anticipated Brexit divorce bill.\nConservative MP Peter Bone takes to the stage. He talks of the horror of being at the mercy of Europe. \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight world wars\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo more German cars!\u201d shouts a member of the audience.\n\u201c\u2026 to be subservient,\u201d Bone continues. \u201cWe want to make our own laws in our own countries... The thing that annoyed people enormously was, when we make laws they\u2019re not judged by our own judges, they\u2019re not decided in our supreme court \u2013 they\u2019re decided somewhere in Europe by a bunch of judges, half of whom are not qualified anyway.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t,\u201d cries a woman at the back.\nThis might be Margaret Atwood\u2019s Gilead; you would fear for the safety of those European judges were they here today.\nBone does a decent job of whipping up the anger, but he knows he\u2019s only the warm-up act. \u201cI think there\u2019s someone else,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMr Brexit!\u201d calls a voice in the crowd.\n\u201cNigel Farage! Mr Brexit, as somebody says at the front.\u201d Bone gets his biggest cheer, and Tice takes over for the already familiar introduction. \u201cThe vilification, abuse, threats to his family, what he\u2019s put up with is unbelievable. His courage manifested when he was unfortunately in a very serious plane crash on one election day. It would have killed many people. Bless him: he dragged himself out, wiped away the odd bit of blood, dusted himself down and promptly lit a cigarette. He is a true patriot. He is possibly the original Brexiter.\u201d\nAgain the sea splits for Farage, and again he looks more spiv than saviour. There is a touch of Private Walker, the black-market wheeler-dealer in Dad\u2019s Army, whose absence from the regular armed forces was explained by a corned-beef allergy. \u201cGood afternoon, Birmingham,\u201d he begins. \u201cI\u2019ve given the best part of my adult life, battling, fighting, campaigning for one thing \u2013 that we, the British people, should be masters of our own destiny, running our own lives, in control of our own country. And. That. Referendum. On. June. 23rd. When. We. Won. That. Vote. Was. The. Happiest. Day. Of. My Life.\u201d\nFarage has an advantage over many politicians in knowing how to make his audience laugh. \u201cWe were told by the party leaders that whatever we decided they would abide by,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, do you remember Mr Cameron?\u201d\n\u201cBoooo!\u201d comes the catcall.\n\u201cThat\u2019s surprising, because most of the country has forgotten about him!\u201d There is laughter across the room.\n\u201cMr Cameron spent \u00a39m of taxpayers\u2019 money putting that outrageous leaflet through every door in the land.\u201d\n\u201cShame! Shame!\u201d Cameron is heckled in absentia.\n\u201cHow I enjoyed posting mine back through the letterbox of No 10,\u201d Farage continues, \u201cwith a few suitable annotations, but not ones I am going to share with you on a public platform.\u201d\nThen he\u2019s back on the attack. \u201cNow we are told that we didn\u2019t understand what we were voting for. You. Are. All. Thick. And. Pig. Ignorant. They even have the effrontery to tell us that people were lied to \u2013 despite the fact that the greatest lie of all was told back in the 1970s, when my parents\u2019 generation were told they were joining nothing more than a common market which was about friendship and free trade. Even if Boris\u2019s figures on the side of a bus were a bit on the high side, it is nothing to the half a century of lies we have been told by the establishment.\u201d\nFarage\u2019s argument here is straightforward. The referendum was nothing to do with the terms of leaving, and nobody thought it was; we were simply asked whether we wanted in or out. He even attempts to claim the moral high ground when it comes to the migration argument. The EU, he states, is supremacist. Why should somebody from Europe have more right to live in our country than, say, somebody from Africa or Asia? It\u2019s the only line that is not met with a resounding cheer.\nBut by the time he is done, calling on the audience to stop the Brexit betrayal, they are chanting for more. Lynne, a friendly, middle-aged woman who has been sharing her Polos with me, is on her feet. I ask her why she feels so strongly. She talks about the need for sovereignty, to be able to make our own laws and reclaim our pride. Is it anything to do with immigration? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cNot really.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut Birmingham isn\u2019t as clean as it used to be. Is it? They leave their furniture in the street.\u201d Who \u2013 the Europeans? \u201cNo, the Muslims. There are areas that are predominantly Muslim. I\u2019m not racist. They\u2019re not to blame. But they don\u2019t love our country like we do. They put mattresses in the street. They all drive nice cars, mind \u2013 Mercs and BMWs. And then they\u2019ve got their rubbish piled up.\u201d She offers me another Polo.\nI look for Farage, but the man of the people has done a disappearing act. The last time we met, in 2009, he took me to his local pub for breakfast (three pints of Landlord), told me his political hero was Enoch Powell, and talked with pride of his German wife Kirsten and his love of a good lapdance club. But the more renowned this populist becomes, the less accessible he is; Farage declined to be interviewed for this article.\nMeanwhile, the less starry members of Leave Means Leave are happy to talk. I ask Peter Bone what populism means to him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t populist mean what most people want?\u201d he says.\nLongworth comes up with a similar definition. \u201cIt\u2019s to do with being popular among people, so if populism means we\u2019re actually supporting people\u2019s democratic rights, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\nAs the audience leave, I scan the hall for somebody who looks a bit younger, and spot Jared Day. He is in his 20s, and a wheelchair-user. Day is a smart, engaging man who voted remain but has since become a leaver. Why? \u201cThe EU\u2019s lack of respect. I thought the photo that Donald Tusk posted was very distasteful.\u201d\nUnlike many politicians, Day has no problem explaining why populism means much more than being popular. \u201cPopulism is more about nationalist lines, the nation state. When you hear about populist governments, they tend to be more internal-looking, almost isolationist.\u201d\nContemporary populism is by its nature oppositional. In his 2016 book The Populist Explosion, a study of how the great recession shaped US and European politics, author John B Judis distinguishes between left- and rightwing populism as follows: \u201cLeftwing populists champion the people against an elite or an establishment. Theirs is a vertical politics of the bottom and middle, arrayed against the top. Rightwing populists champion the people against an elite that they accuse of favouring a third group, which can consist, for instance, of immigrants, Islamists, or African-American militants. Rightwing populism is triadic: it looks upward, but also down upon an out group.\u201d This feels very much the Leave Means Leave approach.\nOn my way out, I catch two pairs of sisters chatting. Like Day, their youth makes them stand out. Jill and her sister, who does not give her name, are wearing Brexit sweatshirts, while two identical twins, who also won\u2019t give their names, are formally dressed in skirts and jackets; they could be extras for a film about the suffragette movement.\nJill is a chemistry teacher from Sheffield who says she wants Brexit for her pupils. She believes there will be more money for them when we leave, and they will have a better chance of getting decent jobs. One of the twins also teaches, and is looking forward to a brighter future. All four women tell me they despise the mainstream media, particularly the Guardian, because it is a purveyor of fake news. What they dislike most is the notion that they must be ignorant or bigoted to have voted leave. The twins take up Farage\u2019s theme, finishing each other\u2019s sentences.\n\u201cThey demonise us\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 And make out we\u2019re really stupid\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 That we don\u2019t know what we voted for\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\nJill, who is wearing union jack trainers, says: \u201cDemonise is the exact word. I so object to that. I\u2019m not far right or racist. And that, I\u2019m afraid, is the media.\u201d\nThe women talk about wages being undercut by EU workers, how hard the trade unions have fought for the minimum wage, the need for controlled migration and to look after our own.\nAs for the notion that British people don\u2019t want many of the jobs the Europeans do, Jill is not having any of it. \u201cAbsolute rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying the kids I teach are lazy. They\u2019re not. They want a job and can\u2019t get one, because it\u2019s been taken by somebody from the European Union.\u201d\nAll four women sing from the same hymn sheet, despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum. \u201cThe main thing that got me into politics was the magnificent patriot Nigel Farage,\u201d Jill says. The twins are Corbynistas, dismayed that the Labour leader has suppressed his anti-Europe instincts.\nThe conversation leaves my head spinning; in some ways, left and right seem an irrelevance in Brexit Britain. Perhaps that\u2019s why some Labour MPs have been happy to align themselves with Leave Means Leave. Yet look more closely and you realise that the group is not as cross-party as it would have us believe. All six members of its advisory board are white, male Conservatives. Of the 25 MPs it names as supporters on its website, 24 are Conservatives or members of the DUP. The one exception is the independent MP Kelvin Hopkins, who was suspended from the Labour party in 2017 after it was alleged he sexually harassed a local activist. (He has denied the claims.) Of the 44 prominent members pictured on Leave Means Leave\u2019s website, all are white and 43 are men; Andrea Jenkyns, the Conservative who succeeded Ed Balls as MP for Morley and Outwood, is the only woman.\nIt\u2019s a Tuesday night in October and we\u2019re in Bournemouth, which voted to leave Europe by a margin of 9%. Like the other events, tonight\u2019s rally is sold out. Before the speakers start, the audience is shown a film about how intransigent the EU has been in negotiating Brexit. The narrator asks: \u201cWhen we asked for cooperation on security, the boys in Brussels said Non! When Mrs May offered flexibility on Labour mobility, the boys in Brussels said Non! Mrs May even offered them more of our money, and this time the boys in Brussels said they wanted more! The UK has consistently offered the boys in Brussels huge concessions yet it is never enough for these unaccountable Eurocrats who, let\u2019s remember, spend an awful lot of their time\u2026 drunk.\u201d\nOn the screen, a cartoon inebriated Eurocrat topples over, and the crowd cheer. Alcohol is a recurring theme tonight. JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin was due to make an appearance, but he has gone down with a tummy bug, so we are played a video of him addressing a rally in Torquay the previous week instead.\n\u201cLord Bamford, Sir James Dyson, Tim Martin\u2026 have you noticed how all the great entrepreneurs are Brexiters?\u201d John Longworth says. \u201cTim set up a chain of almost 1,000 pubs.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Nigel\u2019s drunk in most of them!\u201d heckles a man in front of me affectionately.\nTice has perfected his introduction over the past month. \u201cHe is possibly the original, truest Brexiteer!\u201d he begins.\n\u201cHe should be prime minister!\u201d cries a voice from the front.\nTice tells the story of Farage\u2019s helicopter crash, this time leaving a gap for the audience to applaud each heroic act. \u201cIt would have killed many people, but not our good friend. He dragged himself out of the plane, wiped away the blood from his head, from his eyes, dusted himself down\u2026 \u201d\n\u201cHoorah!\u201d\n\u201cPut his hand in his pocket... \u201d\n\u201cHoorah!\u201d\n\u201cReached out for a packet of cigarettes and lit a fag.\u201d\n\u201cHoooooorraaaaah!\u201d\nFarage begins with a humblebrag. \u201cGood evening, Bournemouth. I\u2019m going to take issue with the deputy chair\u2019s introduction. I\u2019m not the original Brexiteer. That was Henry VIII.\u201d He appears to be in a jovial mood. \u201cMy day started when I got off the battlebus in Christchurch. I went round Christchurch market, and I met some stallholders and members of the public, and then it all went wrong.\u201d Pause. \u201cWe found a pub.\u201d\nThis is Farage the seaside standup, and the audience lap it up. \u201cThe day after the referendum, there was an emergency debate in the European parliament. I thought I\u2019d better show up, you know, \u2019cos I\u2019ve worked quite hard over there. I\u2019ve always tried to make positive and helpful contributions. And there waiting for me was European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who came up, put an arm round me, and said\u2026 \u2018Bastard!\u2019\u201d\nThe hall erupts. Then Farage flips the mood. \u201cI said to them, \u2018That morning when I came here, 17 years ago, I said I would lead a campaign to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union, and you laughed at me. Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018you\u2019re not laughing now, are you?\u2019\u201d\nAnd suddenly Farage flips again; now he\u2019s mobilising his troops. \u201cThis is the most important campaign that has ever been fought in British history. This. Campaign. Is. About. Right. And. Wrong. We are simply asking our politicians to do what they promised.\u201d\nThere was a time, he says, when he trusted May when she said that no deal was better than a bad deal. \u201cShe kept on telling us Brexit means Brexit, but little did we know that she is a woman who is too weak to negotiate with the European commission.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019d much rather we sent someone like Trump, personally!\u201d The audience applauds.\nNow it\u2019s time for strategy, as Farage tells supporters how to confront MPs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you writing letters to them. Go and visit them at their surgeries, queue around the block, meet them face to face, make them feel the heat, make them understand that being part of a customs union, being a vassal state with laws made somewhere else, is unacceptable. And that if they do this, you will never give them your vote again. Make. Them. Feel. The. Heat. We in Leave Means Leave are reactivating the people\u2019s army.\u201d\nThe language is tough and militaristic, and Farage\u2019s delivery chilling. He warns that if he is forced to fight a second referendum we\u2019ll see a very different Farage: \u201cThis time, no more Mr Nice Guy.\u201d I can\u2019t help thinking back to his victory speech after the referendum, delivered at 4am on 24 June 2016. Farage boasted that Brexit had been achieved \u201cwithout a single bullet being fired\u201d. It was only eight days after the strongly pro-EU Labour MP Jo Cox had been murdered on her way to a constituency surgery. Her killer, Thomas Mair, shouted \u201cKeep Britain independent\u201dand \u201cBritain first\u201d as he shot and stabbed her. But Farage appeared to have forgotten that.\nOn 13 November, Theresa May announces that the UK and the European Union have reached an agreement; the next day the Cabinet signs off on the deal. Leave Means Leave organises a protest outside Downing Street. On 15 November, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is one of four ministers to resign amid calls for the prime minister to step down.\nBritain remains gridlocked; Westminster is in chaos and yet nothing changes. On 10 December, the day before the Commons is due to have its say on the deal, May announces the vote will be delayed. The following day Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, announces that the threshold has been reached for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister; at least 48 letters have been submitted by Tory MPs. Although May survives, winning by 200 votes to 117, she appears to have as little chance of getting her deal through the Commons as she did before.\nMeanwhile, there is a similar upheaval in Farage\u2019s world \u2013 revolution leading to stasis. On 22 November, Ukip leader Gerard Batten announces that he has appointed far-right activist and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson as a special adviser on \u201crape gangs\u201d and prison reform. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Farage says he is \u201cappalled\u201d, that Ukip is becoming a party of \u201cstreet activism\u201d, and that Batten has sabotaged his own efforts to make Ukip \u201ca non-racist, non-sectarian party\u201d. This is the same Farage who masterminded the Breaking Point poster; the same Farage who talked only days ago about mobilising a people\u2019s army. On 4 December, he announces that he is quitting Ukip \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d: he has lost his battle to \u201cprofessionalise\u201d the party he helped found in 1993. But the truth is, he has outgrown Ukip. Its once marginal voice is now mainstream, and Farage has bigger political fish to fry.\nIt is 14 December, and all the big guns are out for the Leave Means Leave rally at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, opposite the Houses of Parliament. Jacob Rees-Mogg, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin, the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson and, of course, Farage, line up to deliver the same message \u2013 No Deal? No Problem \u2013 only with more urgency. There is a new chant: \u201cLet\u2019s go bigger than Europe. Let\u2019s go Global. Let\u2019s Go WTO.\u201d Inconsistency appears to be a virtue for this populist campaign; globalism is now presented as a positive rather than a negative.\nTonight, the two Labour MPs who have spoken at previous rallies, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, are on the same bill, giving the event a more genuinely cross-party feel. But there is nothing diverse about the audience, and the whiteness is, if anything, even more stark than at previous rallies \u2013 not least because nearly every security officer on the door is black.\nThis is the first rally held in the heart of remain-land \u2013 London \u2013 and the mood is darker, more defiant. There is a sense of the battle lines hardening: only two days ago, chancellor Philip Hammond described hard Brexiters as \u201cextremists\u201d.\nTonight, all six speakers have the knack of being able to incite the crowd or make them laugh \u2013 even the antediluvian Rees-Mogg, dubbed the honourable member for the 18th century. Hoey asks how we can trust the government to take us out of the EU when it is led by a prime minister who is a remainer, a chancellor who regards Brexiters as extremists and a Speaker \u201cwho has a Bollocks to Brexit sticker on his car\u201d. Tim Martin concludes his speech by quoting Paul Simon (\u201cYou just slip out the back, Jack/Make a new plan, Stan/You don\u2019t need to be coy, Roy/Just get yourself free\u201d). Puce-faced Sammy Wilson delivers a barnstorming unionist speech (\u201cThe EU is demanding the price for leaving is splitting the United Kingdom. Never!\u201d) and says that not even Arthur Daley would have had the brass to flog the Chequers deal to the British public.\nAs always, though, Farage is the star turn. He makes the familiar jokes about booze, dismisses the \u201cjumped-up foreign bureaucrats\u201d of Brussels, and describes the Italian government (which has scrapped humanitarian protection status for asylum seekers) as \u201crather splendid\u201d. But this is a more muted, restrained Farage. He admits he is worried.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid, folks, I don\u2019t see the great Brexit betrayal as anywhere near finished. I\u2019m now more fearful than at any time I have been during this process that, outrageous and monstrous though it is, we\u2019re going to finish up being sent back for a second referendum\u2026 My message, folks, is it would be wrong of us not to get ready, not to prepare for the worst-case scenario\u2026 Let us be ready not just to fight back, not just to be ready for that referendum, but if it comes we\u2019ll win it next time. By. A. Much. Bigger. Majority.\u201d Back in January 2018, Farage surprised everyone by calling for a second referendum, on the grounds it would deliver a bigger leave majority. But it was a classic Farage blip, and he has never called for one since. Last August, he dismissed the idea as \u201cnot the people\u2019s vote, but the George Soros vote\u201d.\nAfter his speech in London, Farage is mobbed. A huddle forms around him, comprised mainly of the few young people in the audience. A woman in her 20s, draped in a union jack, asks for a selfie. Her friend, also draped in a union jack, pushes her way forward. \u201cExcuse me, seeing as I got her these tickets, the least you can do is give me a kiss,\u201d she says to Farage.\nThis is the closest I\u2019ve been to him in three months of following the Leave Means Leave campaign \u2013 within shouting distance. So I do just that. Earlier this evening, someone in the audience asked who people should vote for, now that Farage has quit Ukip. The question went unanswered, so I ask again. \u201cNigel, who should we vote for?\u201d\n\u201cWho asked that?\u201d he says.\n\u201cI asked that,\u201d I bellow, deep within the bosom of the Faragistas. He looks at me.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s find out, shall we? At the moment I couldn\u2019t vote for anybody. But let\u2019s see how this plays out. The cards haven\u2019t fallen yet. I meant what I said tonight. All the Eurosceptics are hoping we\u2019re going to get through this, but I\u2019m actually more pessimistic.\u201d\nDo we need to mobilise? \u201cYes. When you build an army, you don\u2019t do it wanting to fight a war. But if a war happens, you\u2019ve got it. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve now got to do.\u201d And with that he\u2019s off, flanked by two security men.\nI shout one of his own slogans after him as he walks away. \u201cNigel, no more Mr Nice Guy?\u201d He turns on his heels, walks back and looks me in the face. For once there isn\u2019t a hint of a smile. \u201cOh listen. Listen. If they make us do this again, I shall be a bit tougher than last time.\u201d\n This article forms part of the Guardian\u2019s ongoing series, The new populism; read more here.\nIf you would like to make a comment on this piece, and be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

        "content": "Interior department continues processing permits and moves forward with controversial plan to increase drilling in the Arctic\nThree weeks into the longest US government shutdown in history, many important government services have been paused \u2013 but the Trump administration has continued efforts to expand oil drilling.\nDespite the shutdown directive, which has seen national park staff furloughed and the parks suffering from neglect, the interior department has continued processing oil drilling permits and applications. It has also moved forward with a controversial plan to increase drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A).\nAccording to a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d for an interior department agency, the Bureau of Land Management, approved last year, employees exempt from furloughs include those \u201cworking on selected energy, minerals and other associated permit activities for which the bureau charges a processing fee\u201d.\nAs a result, workers in New Mexico and Wyoming have continued to process oil and gas drilling applications.\nIn Alaska, the Trump administration is rolling out a contentious plan to overwrite Obama-era protections and expand the oil and gas leasing in two controversial areas, the wildlife refuge and the NPR-A. Since the shutdown began, the interior department moved forward with previously scheduled public meetings to educate stakeholders and provide opportunities for comment and discussion.\nConversely, the same type of meetings scheduled by the department for an 800-megawatt wind farm project being built off the coast of Massachusetts, were canceled.\nOversight officials have begun to investigate the agency.\n\u201cAsking people to comment on two major development processes in the Arctic with huge potential environmental and human consequences without anyone in the agency able to answer questions defeats the purpose of the public participation process,\u201d chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Ra\u00fal M Grijalva wrote in a letter to the acting secretary of the interior, David Benhardt on 7 January.

        "content": "Cosmologist Jo Dunkley on the most mind-bending recent discoveries, as astronomers use powerful new telescopes to explore nature\u2019s weirdest stars, \u2018dark energy\u2019 and the origins of gold\nAstronomy is in the middle of a data revolution, a time of enormous discovery. Humans have been looking up at the stars for thousands of years, but modern telescopes and computers are rapidly accelerating our understanding. We know far more than we did even 20 years ago, and we are now much closer to answering questions about whether life exists elsewhere in the cosmos, how our planet came to be here, our cosmic origins and eventual fate.\nOn a clear night the stars twinkle in the sky, and often we can see the bright planets of our own solar system in orbit, like us, around our sun. Until the early 1990s, we had no idea whether there were any other planets around the stars in the sky. Astronomers suspected so, but had no way to prove it. We have in the past decade found thousands in orbit around foreign stars, and have a better idea of how common they are. A sizable fraction of stars probably have their own planets, their own worlds carried around them in the most fantastically diverse solar systems.\nLook up at the stars, though, and you can\u2019t see any of their planets. They are tiny and don\u2019t make much light of their own. Even with powerful telescopes it is hard to see a planet directly, as the light from its parent star is blindingly bright in comparison. Instead, astronomers have devised ingenious methods to find them. One is the \u201cwobbling\u201d effect: a planet makes its parent star wobble just a little as it orbits around it, the star feeling a subtle pull of gravity from the smaller planet. In 1995 the Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz used the Haute-Provence Observatory telescope in France to pinpoint a star, 51 Pegasi b, that was wobbling just as expected. It revealed a planet, similar in size to Jupiter but so close to its star that it takes only four days to orbit around it, far quicker of course than Earth or any of the planets in our solar system.\nAstronomers have since found a huge haul of planets using Nasa\u2019s Kepler satellite, which launched in 2009 and ended its spectacularly successful mission late in 2018. Kepler was designed to spot planets crossing in front of their parent stars, looking for the slight dimming effect of the planet blocking some of the starlight. Kepler has found thousands of planets this way, including many whose complete orbit around their star takes just hours or days. Some are so close to their star that their surface must be entirely molten lava. It has shown us solar systems with multiple planets, and some planets that orbit around two stars \u2013 \u201cTatooine\u201d planets, named after Luke Skywalker\u2019s fictional home. Some planets are larger than Jupiter, some are as small as our moon. Most were found by professional astronomers, but amateurs have found them too, using pattern recognition to mine online data from the Kepler mission and catch planets that automated searches had missed. We now think there are more planets than stars in the sky.\nWe want to find out how likely it is that a habitable planet like Earth exists and, even better, to find one. In the elusive \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone, the conditions must be just right: not too hot and not too cold. Astronomers have already found a few dozen planets like this, of which at least three are in the Trappist I solar system, found in 2015 around one of our nearest stars. Trappist I has seven planets, all similar in size to Earth, and at least one has a liquid water ocean. Studying these planets, and some of the hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets in our Milky Way galaxy is the goal of ambitious new projects. Nasa\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), launched in 2018, is expected to find more than 20,000 new planets. The most interesting will be examined in greater detail by the James Webb Space telescope, the Hubble space telescope\u2019s successor, due to fly in the 2020s.\nThe stars in the sky are hosts to this wealth of solar systems, but they also have a vital role to play as nature\u2019s great factories. Consider gold: where did it come from? Astronomers have long wondered how gold came to be part of Earth\u2019s ingredients. We know that it is stars themselves that manufacture what our own bodies are made of, including mostly carbon and oxygen. The British-American astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first worked out in the 1920s that stars are themselves mostly just hydrogen and helium gas. The intense heat at the heart of stars can fuse together these tiny atoms into slightly larger ones, which are then ejected into space when the stars explode at the end of their lives. Those recycled remnants will later be present at the birth of new stars like our sun, and will end up making new planets like our own. But the alchemy of making gold has long been a mystery. Gold has much larger atoms than carbon and oxygen, and can\u2019t be made in the core of a star. The explosions of individual stars could create some of it, but not enough.\nIn 2017 astronomers concluded that another way gold is generated is during intense collisions of pairs of neutron stars. Neutron stars are nature\u2019s weirdest. They are incredibly dense, the result of squashing a star larger than our sun into a space just a few miles across, after it has run out of the fuel that kept it burning bright. A spoonful of neutron star weighs as much as a mountain. We can\u2019t see them with regular telescopes, but they send out radio waves. The stars spin around and, if oriented right, their beam of radio waves sweeps past Earth regularly, like a lighthouse beacon. The astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell first discovered one of these stars in November 1967 using a radio telescope she built (with Anthony Hewish) as a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. The pulses of radio waves she saw from the star were so regular, arriving every second, that they initially named it LGM-1 for \u201cLittle Green Men\u201d, half-jokingly considering that it might be a signal from aliens.\nWhen a pair of these neutron stars orbit around each other, their pull of gravity is so strong that they actually deform the fabric of space-time itself. A gravitational wave ripples outwards, subtly shrinking and then expanding space and everything in it, over and over, as it passes on by. On 17 August 2017 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave observatory in the US (Ligo), and the Virgo detector in Italy felt a burst of these waves passing through Earth. Using lasers to measure the precise length of two 4km-long tubes positioned at right angles, they directly measured the tiny squeezing and stretching of the tubes. They were sensing two neutron stars for the first time, catching the last two minutes of their life as they spun thousands of times around each other before colliding.\nThe Ligo and Virgo teams immediately alerted astronomers around the world, so that they could search for the aftermath. It was still daytime in Hawaii and Chile, home to many of the largest telescopes, so they had to wait until nightfall. Astronomer Ryan Foley and his team from the University of California in Santa Cruz were the first to locate a burst of intense light coming from the collision, using the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. They in turn alerted the community so that other telescopes could swing to take a closer look. In the end it was seen by 70 observatories on all seven continents and from space. What they had found was a kilonova and by studying the explosion, astronomers could tell that it had produced huge amounts of gold and platinum, much more than the entire weight of Earth. That particular collision happened too far away to have produced the gold on your finger, but here at last was decisive proof that closer to home collisions like this could have created Earth\u2019s gold.\nThe stars, source of heat and light and of our very bodies, give an impression of permanence. There they are, night after night. We do, though, already know that they will change. Their positions in the sky will gradually shift, as our own solar system moves around the Milky Way galaxy, our larger home to billions of stars. And they will eventually stop burning bright, and new ones will be born. Within astronomy, my particular expertise is cosmology, in which I ask questions about the life story of the whole of the universe. As a professor at Princeton University I also teach undergraduate students, and I train junior scientists to ask, and answer, their own questions about the cosmos.\nBy the late 20th century astronomers had begun to consider a big change on the horizon. If we look beyond our own Milky Way galaxy, we find a sea of galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars, strewn throughout space. A century ago, the astronomers Edwin Hubble and Georges Lema\u00eetre showed that the galaxies are, on average, all moving apart from each other. Space itself is growing. But the pull of gravity of all the galaxies towards each other should tend to slow down the growth of space, just as a ball thrown in the air comes to a halt and then falls back down again. So astronomers turned to wondering whether space would one day stop growing altogether, and then start to shrink. Billions of years in the future, might all the galaxies come crashing back towards each other, invading our local cocoon of stars and marking the end of the universe as we know it?\nThe key to answering this lay in measuring how fast space is growing and comparing it to its growth in the past. You can of course see into the past by looking far out into space, at places from which light set off a long time ago. Using a set of telescopes in Chile, Hawaii and the Canary Islands, rival teams of astronomers made new measurements of distant galaxies, using extremely bright exploding stars as cosmic markers. The teams, led by Brian Schmidt at Mount Stromlo observatory in Australia, and Saul Perlmutter at the University of California in Berkeley, measured galaxies whose light set off as long as 7bn years ago. In 1998 both announced the same surprising discovery, which was that space was not slowing down at all. Instead, galaxies appeared to be moving apart from each other faster and faster. This was as peculiar as if you threw a ball in the air, and it sped up and away from your hand into the sky. By the early 2000s other measurements of the universe were telling the same story, and over the past decade the evidence has become incontrovertible. We still don\u2019t yet know why this is happening. Astronomers refer to whatever is causing this as \u201cdark energy\u201d, a form of energy we have not yet identified. It could be the energy of empty space itself, or something entirely new. It is a mystery waiting to be solved.\nThis new finding means that we no longer expect all the galaxies in space to come crashing back towards us. We are probably safe from that fate. But our own Milky Way is still on a collision course with at least one other galaxy. We are flying towards Andromeda, the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way, at a speed of more than 50 miles per second, and there is no turning back. A few billion years from now we will unavoidably collide and mix our stars together. Any living beings in our solar system by then will see a spectacular change in the night sky when it happens, but the gaps between stars is so large that it is unlikely any will physically collide. Our sun will simply find itself part of a larger home.\nThis future view of our cosmos, our revolutionary discoveries of new worlds around stars, and our understanding of how the inner workings of stars make the fabric of our lives, are just some of this century\u2019s exciting discoveries. A common thread is that major advances in astronomy take teams of scientists working together, using telescopes around the world and in space, coupled with powerful computers. The questions we are asking cannot, for the most part, be solved by people working alone. As a result, the community is international. Meet an astronomer anywhere in the world, and most likely they are asking the same questions about the existence of life elsewhere, our place in space and the cosmic story of how we came to be here. And with many magnificent new telescopes being readied for the coming decade, we can expect together to take further great strides in our understanding of the night skies, and the wider universe, in the coming 20 years. We know, based on past experience, that the most exciting discoveries will probably be the ones we have been least expecting.\n Jo Dunkley\u2019s Our Universe: An Astronomer\u2019s Guide is published by Pelican on 31 January.",

Forbes identified a \u201cfailure of imagination\u201d from politicians who spent so much of their working lives in densely-populated cities that they cannot fathom there are areas of the country where that is not the case.\nHer comments came ahead of a debate on depopulation in the Scottish parliament on Wednesday.\n\u201cYou could push it further, to people who are so far removed from reality that they pooh-pooh the fact that the average wage in this country is in the lower \u00a320,000s,\u201d said Forbes. One of the most controversial aspects of the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration strategy is the \u00a330,000 salary cap, reported to be strongly favoured by Theresa May.\nForbes, who is considered to be one of the rising stars of the Scottish parliament, is the MSP for the sprawling constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, which includes some of the most rugged and beautiful swathes of the Highlands. The area is facing a demographic timebomb, says Forbes, which Brexit will compound, with latest estimates suggesting it could lose more than a quarter of its population by 2046 if current trends are left unchecked.\n\u201cFor the UK government to consider limiting immigration flies in the face of the challenges that currently face the Highlands, and that have faced the Highlands for decades, if not centuries,\u201d said Forbes. \u201cIf you look at the areas where there is the greatest pressure on recruitment, particularly around the hospitality industry, they are [earning] considerably under the \u00a330k mark. The whole idea of a hierarchy of skills is completely contrary to what businesses tell me they are crying out for: waiters, chefs, labourers.\u201d\nThe SNP government, in which Forbes is now a junior minister, was calling for the devolution of migration policy long before Brexit concentrated other minds on the issue. \u201cThere are no UK-based politicians who are willing to make the positive case for immigration. [The SNP] have been, and nobody really cares,\u201d said Forbes.\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t accept that Scotland is especially better and more liberal when it comes to immigration, I do think the issue has not been weaponised to the same extent here.\u201d\nForbes won the \u201cone to watch\u201d category at the Scottish politician of the year awards in November, her second year of being nominated after becoming an MSP in May 2016. The former accountant grew up in Dingwall and studied history at Cambridge. She quickly came to notice as an able advocate for her constituents the Brain family, an Australian couple and their son who had settled in the Highlands but faced deportation following a visa dispute.\nIn June 2018, Forbes was appointed as the minister for public finance and digital economy in a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in which Nicola Sturgeon promoted a number of fresh faces.\nA fluent Gaelic speaker, Forbes delivered a full speech in the language during a Holyrood debate earlier this year, while MSPs listened to a translation on headphones. She has weclomed the recent increase in children enrolling in Gaelic-medium education, despite criticism that mainly middle-class parents in cities were attracted by the pupil-teacher ratios rather than by the language itself.\nHowever, she insisted education alone was not enough to revitalise the language, currently spoken by around 1% of Scots. \u201cIt has to be the language of people\u2019s hearts and daily usage in communities. We are still slightly nervous and feel slightly ashamed of using it, and it\u2019s so quickly hijacked by politics. I feel as an SNP MSP it\u2019s harder for me to defend Gaelic because it\u2019s so easily dismissed as a nationalist cause, which is ridiculous.\u201d\nAshamed is a strong word to use, but Forbes said that was tied to the older generation\u2019s sense of Gaelic as \u201can uneducated language\u201d.",

The death toll figure was later revised down by the police and confirmed by the minister in a tweet.\n\u201cAt 8.37am the fire brigade was called to 6 Rue Tr\u00e9vise to investigate a gas leak. While they were there a dramatic explosion occurred,\u201d Castaner said. He praised the courage of the firefighters who risked their lives to save people. He said one firefighter had remained under the rubble for two and a half hours before being rescued by colleagues.\nThe Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell said: \u201cI profoundly regret the death of three people in an explosion in central Paris, among them one Spanish citizen.\u201d\nR\u00e9my Heitz, the Paris public prosecutor, said an investigation had been launched into the tragedy. The origin of the explosion was a \u201cpocket of gas\u201d. He added that the tragedy appeared to be \u201caccidental\u201d but that police experts would verify the exact reason for the explosion.\nThe blast and subsequent fire destroyed a bakery on the ground floor and destroyed apartments above. It seriously damaged several neighbouring buildings and shattered windows for 100 metres around.\nVehicles parked in the street were overturned and set alight by the force of the explosion.\nThe blast happened as Paris prepared for a ninth weekend of gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests across the city and elsewhere in France.\nThe prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, attended the scene.\nThe explosion, which happened just before 9am, was heard a mile away. Dozens of firefighters, police and ambulances rushed to the scene and rapidly sealed off surrounding streets, many of them cloaked in a thick cloud of acrid smoke.\nThe bakery owner, Hubert Beatrix, watched shocked as dozens of firefighters struggled to put out the blaze and evacuate residents of nearby buildings.\n\u201cI have no idea what happened. There\u2019s no gas in my shop apart from a small supply for heating. My ovens are electric,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cThe shop was closed, luckily for me and my customers. Someone called me to tell me about this, but I still don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\nCommander Eric Moulin, of the Paris fire service, said: \u201cOf those who are in a critical condition, two fire officers and three civilians have life-threatening injures. One of the firefighters was out for several minutes and rescued by his colleagues.\u201d\n#Paris gas explosion.

I heard it at home a mile away. pic.twitter.com/2ZCRqLcNoU\nThe bakery was almost entirely destroyed, leaving a few columns holding up the rest of the six-storey building.\nThe nearby Place de l\u2019Opera was cleared to allow three emergency helicopters to land in order to evacuate injured people.\nOne female resident said: \u201cThe neighbours called the fire service because there was a very strong smell of gas this morning. Fire officers knocked on doors to tell us to stay where we were and shortly after that there was an explosion. There\u2019s nothing left of our apartment.

        "content": "Youngsters say cycling is \u2018too scary\u2019, bike sales are static and stores are closing, as highlighted by James Corden last week\nIt was a small, handwritten notice taped to the window of a shop but it spoke volumes. \u201cFor 2019 switch off your device, learn to talk to people again. Use your local shops. If its [sic] cheaper online save up and buy local, remember they are familys [sic] not faceless companies. More convenient online? Don\u2019t be lazy go and get it local. Do more to protect our society this year.\u201d\nThe message from Paul Duncan, owner of Pauls Custom Cycles in Peckham, south London, which closed just before Christmas, was picked up by the presenter James Corden, who posted it on his Twitter feed last week with the comment: \u201cThis is a recently closed down shop in London. I think they may have a point... thanks for sharing.\u201d\nCorden\u2019s tweet, which went viral, sparking a predictable row about millionaire expats lecturing others on how to spend their money, is another reminder of the continuing plight of Britain\u2019s beleaguered bicycle shops.\nAcross the country, cycle shops that have been a regular fixture of their local high streets for decades are closing down in their droves. The bikebiz website regularly tracks closures, compiling an increasingly long list of names. In the last couple of years many illustrious shops have disappeared, including the 105-year-old Ben Hayward Cycles in Cambridge and M Steel Cycles on Tyneside, which had been trading since 1894. In November, the oldest bike shop in Bath, Johns Bikes, which had been trading since the Seventies and once had a turnover of \u00a31m a year, closed.\nIt is not just an independent shop that is being lost when a store closes, according to Sam Jones, senior campaigns officer at the charity Cycling UK: \u201cWhen you buy a bike from one of these shops they\u2019re making sure you get the right bike for you rather than the bike you want. You get to try the bike before you buy, you get the expertise. They are a vital part of cycling life in the UK.\u201d\nBut many customers no longer value these qualities, it appears. A Bicycle Association report found that for every 10 bike shops that closed in 2017 only three have taken their place, the \u201cworst refresh rate since the 1960s when bicycle sales collapsed and when hundreds of Britain\u2019s bike shops closed or moved into different sectors\u201d.\nThis is a recently closed down shop in London. I think they may have a point... thanks for sharing  @Tweet_Dec pic.twitter.com/IkJd6Wc7yj\nEven the established chains are not immune. In the autumn Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley bought Evans Cycles for \u00a38m after it fell into administration and he recently outlined plans to close up to half of its 62 stores.\nThose at the other end of the spectrum are also taking a hit. The Brixton Cycles workers\u2019 co-op in south London, which has existed at various locations for 35 years and commands a loyal following on Twitter, is struggling to stay afloat.\n\u201cUp to Christmas it was touch and go as to whether we could get the rent together for the shop,\u201d said Jim Sullivan, one of the co-op\u2019s nine members. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay ourselves until the 15th and this sort of thing is becoming a more regular occurrence.\u201d\nThe internet is largely to blame, according to Sullivan. Bikes, clothing and components can be bought online significantly cheaper than in shops, which have considerably higher overheads than online brands. \u201cThe rent has become quite an issue for us,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWhen we moved premises it more than tripled overnight.\u201d\nCut-throat margins are reflected in plunging revenues across the sector. In 2010, total bike sales in the UK amounted to \u00a31.49bn but these had declined to \u00a31.28bn by 2016, the most recent figures available and the lowest annual total for seven years. The number of people working in the bicycle trade in the UK dropped from 15,000 to a low of just over 12,400 over the same period.\nLike many other bike shops, Brixton Cycles is tweaking its business model in a bid to stay alive. Its members are discussing pay cuts and becoming more flexible about when they get paid. Many bike shops are now focusing on servicing bikes and building them from parts bought online \u2013 Brixton Cycles charges \u00a3130 to construct a full bike \u2013 rather than relying on sales. \u201cWe\u2019ve just reduced our shopfloor size to increase the workshop \u2013 it\u2019s nearly twice the size now,\u201d Sullivan said.\nThe decline of high street bike shops, at a time when people are being encouraged to be healthier and to reduce their car use, reflects a wider problem: despite millions of pounds being spent in recent years promoting cycling, the number of people using bikes has remained largely static.\nIn 2017, 14% of respondents to a national survey said they cycled at least once a week. One fifth also said they cycled, but less often than that. Two out of three, though, reported that they cycled less than once a year, or never. Those figures have hardly changed since 2003, according to Cycling UK, largely because the younger generation think cycling \u201cis too scary\u201d.\nJones drew parallels between the decline of the bike shop and another institution that is falling out of favour with millennials: \u201cBike shops are like pubs when it comes to maintaining community spirit. In many ways they\u2019re that important.\u201d",

But for the Frank Sinatra songbook read Franz Schubert: this was the devastating song cycle Winterreise. Gripping the edge of the piano like a despairing drinker clutching the bar, Rose poured out his heart in a performance that will be hard to equal this year \u2013 and it\u2019s only January.\nA packed audience, seated at tables around the tiny stage, was transfixed. The tinkle of cutlery and glass gave way to stunned silence. Food was left untouched, such was the visceral power of Rose\u2019s storytelling. For those who have heard his mellifluous voice fill an opera house it was a privilege to be in such an intimate setting, to be close to that supreme sense of line, that untapped power just waiting to be unleashed.\nBeautifully judged accompaniment came from pianist William Vann, the curator of this monthly art song series. Rachmaninov next. Some vodka with your pizza, perhaps?\nThe following evening, Simon Rattle hosted another Half Six Fix at the Barbican, a relaxed affair in which the audience is encouraged to have an hour\u2019s injection of high-quality music from the LSO at the end of the working day, perhaps with a glass of something restorative. Rattle, ever the charming and informative host, told us he would open with a piece he likened to Winterreise, Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen\u2019s Let me tell you. A setting of short, poetic excerpts from Paul Griffiths\u2019s novella of the same name, in which Ophelia tells of her tragedy and imagines a future, it employs only the 481-word vocabulary that Shakespeare allots her. Rattle said it was written for the \u201castonishing\u201d Canadian soprano Barbara Hannigan, and astonishing she duly was, her crystalline voice scaling unimaginable heights in a beguiling work that will haunt the memory.\nBut as much as the orchestra shimmered and glowed and rarely rose above mezzo forte, Hannigan\u2019s words were lost in the hall. There were no surtitles or text in the free programme, but audience members were encouraged to download an app and follow the text on their phones. I couldn\u2019t open the app (surely my failing, not the technology\u2019s) so had to guess at what was being sung. All very frustrating, but thanks to screens placed on either side of the hall, we were able to see the performers close up and appreciate some of the imaginative scoring. Without them we would might not have noticed, for instance, that the sound of soft, regular breathing was made by stroking the bass drum with a square of sandpaper.\nRattle paired the Abrahamsen with Sibelius\u2019s final work, his highly concentrated seventh symphony, a piece, like Let me tell you, in three parts but performed in one single movement \u2013 a 20-minute riptide of emotion, churning ever onwards until landing on the rocky shore of an uneasy C major resolution. It was brilliantly played, with Rattle the helmsman at his assured best. Look out for more of these Fixes. You could become addicted.\nThere was more Sibelius at the Barbican last weekend, when the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain came crashing into town. Under their new conductor, Kirill Karabits, they swept into the second symphony with youthful zeal, the strings pushing the sudden crescendos and diminuendos of the opening figure with exaggerated passion, setting a tone of heightened emotion that ran through the entire piece, even in the beautifully played pianissimo pizzicato of the second movement and the heartfelt oboe solo of the third. All this energy occasionally got in the way of phrasing and finesse, but there was no denying the power of the bracingly optimistic final melody \u2013 a vision of hope for the future, surely exemplified by these fine young players.\nEarlier, they had entertained with a bravura display by the percussion section, brought to the front of the stage for Rick Dior\u2019s Science Fiction, an unashamed celebration of the trashiest sci-fi movies of the 1950s. Flying saucers, men from Mars, hideous monsters and giant scorpions raced around on a big screen while the orchestra did its best to deafen the audience. It wasn\u2019t great music but it was great fun.\nDeadly serious science is the subject of John Adams\u2019s opera Doctor Atomic, the story of J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the bomb. Adams took the music and reshaped it as a symphony in 2007, admitting that much of it was influenced by sci-film film scores. It is frenetic and heartfelt, reflecting both the race to make the bomb and Oppenheimer\u2019s remorse at the monster he created. The music\u2019s frantic figurations were expertly handled by the strings, interspersed with hot blasts of raging brass and thunderous percussion, but several times \u2013 despite some fine solo performances \u2013 a sense of direction was lost in the challenge to meet the score\u2019s myriad technical demands.\nStar ratings (out of five) \n  Winterreise \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \n  Half Six Fix: LSO/Rattle \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \n  National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain/Karabits \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

        "content": "From a traumatic childhood in Dallas to Yale, Harvard, Wall Street and beyond, the businessman and author exemplifies the American dream \u2013 the very myth his new book sets out to dismantle\nCasey Gerald knew he was special from a young age. Not in a conceited or entitled way \u2013 being poor, black, gay, \u201ca damn near orphan\u201d, and from the wrong side of Dallas meant he would often be told otherwise \u2013 but special because his mother insisted he was. \u201cAnd she was the most magical creature I ever knew,\u201d he says, \u201clike something from the movies.\u201d\nGerald\u2019s mother was, he later recognised, a manic depressive \u2013 \u201cwith big, crinkly, burnt-blond hair [that] made her look like a high-yellow Whitney Houston\u201d. She left home and disappeared when he was 13. Some time before, Gerald\u2019s football star father, the son of a renowned Texas preacher, became hooked on heroin only to then carousel in and out of prison. And so this gifted, athletic teenager ended up in the care of his grandmother and older sister \u2013 until a football scholarship to Yale became his ticket \u201cto live America from the very bottom to the very top\u201d.\nGerald and I talk via a video call from Los Angeles. Now 31, he is eloquent, handsome, thoughtful \u2013 the rags-to-riches poster boy for the American dream that his book, There Will Be No Miracles Here, sets out to dismantle. On the surface, his life reads as the elevator pitch for a Disney movie, the Horatio Alger myth beloved of pop culture and politicians; so much so that after meeting Gerald in 2016, former president George W Bush used his story in a speech to illustrate the plucky, inspirational, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps narrative that feeds the country\u2019s identity.\n\u201cI think of my book as an intervention,\u201d says Gerald. \u201cTo turn this American dream on its head is like being the warning on a pack of cigarettes: people will still smoke, but the way we\u2019re taught to live our life in this society can kill you and it is killing people \u2013 even if they\u2019re not dead, they are miserable, sad, depressed. We need to have a referendum on the American machine.\u201d\nWhat would the question be?\n\u201cHow do we build a society where every kid has a shot? It\u2019s as simple as that. One exceptional case [like mine] does not justify the suffering of 13 million American children who don\u2019t have enough food or one in 30 who don\u2019t have a stable place to sleep. My generation has inherited a country that doesn\u2019t work any more.\u201d\nGerald says he feels traumatised not only by his childhood, but by his belief that a Yale degree in political science, a prestigious MBA from Harvard Business School and a glittering career on Wall Street would save him. \u201cFor sure, it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m in therapy.\u201d\nAs a student, he took an internship at Lehman Brothers in the summer the bank filed for bankruptcy. Enthusiasm undimmed, after graduating he worked in economic policy and as an entrepreneur, but neither wealth nor success resolved his internal conflicts. \u201cI had to write this book to understand what was wrong with me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a long journey.\u201d\nGerald\u2019s memoir is a nonlinear collection of memories and experiences, often unsentimental and stark, sometimes elegiac and elliptical. By writing about the dual burden and invisibility of being a black American man, he plays with a literary tradition that has been canonised by the likes of Frederick Douglass, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Ta-Nehisi Coates. It\u2019s an ambitious exercise.\n\u201cThere is a great tradition of people writing on the margins of society and I am grateful for them, but I had no interest in writing that kind of book,\u201d he says. \u201cI set out to tell the truth and understand why I and a lot of my friends were cracked up. I started this in 2016 and so the country and a lot of the world was cracked up too, but I was sad. I wouldn\u2019t say I was having a nervous breakdown but I wasn\u2019t far off.\u201d\nHe wrote the first draft by hand, using \u201cMorning Pages\u201d, a writing style popularised by Julia Cameron\u2019s book The Artist\u2019s Way. This meant writing three pages of longhand every morning, on lined A4 paper, in a stream of consciousness. \u201cI needed it to be a visceral exercise and lose myself in it.\u201d\nBy 29, Gerald had successfully founded (and closed) MBAs Across America, a nonprofit organisation that matched business students with small businesses. Its aim was to \u201cshow that purpose and not profit is the new bottom line\u201d. The model was made open source and taught as part of a curriculum at Harvard Business School.\nAccording to New York magazine, Gerald seemed poised to either \u201crun for national office in either party, become the youngest-ever CEO of a multinational business or produce and star in some viral reality show\u201d. For now, he balks at the idea that he may consider a career in politics.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any political ambitions or willingness to be a politician,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI do believe I have been put on this planet to do real work but my priority is to be well. If I\u2019m well, everything I do will be well.\u201d\nThe experience of losing his grandmother last summer has underlined everything he wants his generation to rail against. \u201cI was asked to write her obituary,\u201d he explains, \u201cand I got the draft [from his family] which was in essence: \u2018she was born, she met this dude, she married him, she had seven of his children, she was a beautiful wife and mother and she died.\u2019 And I thought: \u2018holy shit, who is this? I thought she was a whole person and we\u2019re supposed to go to her funeral and praise her for being submissive?\u2019\u201d He sighs. \u201cI miss her so much. But eulogising her because she never complained? All that stuff, wow, that world is done. My sisters, my friends, my cousins, that is not a way of living for anyone.\u201d\nGerald\u2019s book mirrors the findings of a 2017 Pew study on the American dream that confirms \u201cthe myth of bootstrapping\u201d \u2013 the fantastical notion that wealth and security can be achieved simply if you work and dream hard enough. The report reveals that social mobility between those at the bottom and those in the middle of American society has become increasingly harder, not easier. Given the choice, most families are happier to make ends meet and pay their bills than move up the economic ladder; this reads particularly true of African Americans who are stuck at the lowest levels and more likely to stay there and even potentially fall further behind from one generation to the next.\n\u201cYes, this is Donald Trump\u2019s America,\u201d shrugs Gerald. \u201cBut let me be clear: I\u2019m a black person, a queer person, my grandma\u2019s grandfather was born a slave in Texas. Very few black people \u2013 if any I know \u2013 were shocked that Donald Trump was elected. Donald Trump may be the most American president we\u2019ve ever had!\n\u201cFor 200 something years we\u2019ve been taught that the president was supposed to be better than everyone else \u2013 a Washington or Lincoln. Now is one of the few times we have a president that reflects a strong strain of depravity that has always been part of America. Life for people that Trump has been destroying with his policies \u2013 for poor people, people of colour, for immigrants \u2013 that has been intolerable and unsustainable for a long time.\u201d\nBut Gerald isn\u2019t without hope. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a black American and not understand the extraordinary potential of the human spirit.\u201d In any case, he believes a shift is under way. \u201cFundamentally, the way we are taught to be men in this country is a dead end and it\u2019s changing \u2013 and I\u2019m happy about that,\u201d says Gerald.\nHis book, like the TED talk he delivered in 2016 titled The Gospel of Doubt, begins with the end of the world: a flashback of Millennium Eve when he was in church with his grandmother praying for the Rapture. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for beginning with that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo much of my childhood was the world ending over and over again; no one called a family meeting and said: \u2018Hey Case, how do you feel about your momma disappearing?\u2019 It just happened and then you have to figure life out.\u201d\nFiguring things out included his place in the elite institutions he later found himself in, how he might make a difference, and his sexuality.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to write a dissertation on being an oppressed gay person,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to bring worthy language to the beauty of loving another boy in a society that hates gay people \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to hate myself.\u201d\nThe neighbourhood of Oak Cliff, where Gerald grew up, has barely changed in recent years, he says. Running east of downtown\u2019s ever newer, ever shinier skyscrapers, it is still a predominantly African American area that straddles extreme wealth and deprivation.\n\u201cA lot of white people want to make the conversation about segregation, but I grew with incredible, dedicated black teachers, I had black crossing guards to get me across the street, there were hardly any white people and it did not occur to me then that I was inferior because I was black.\n\u201cDallas, for all its faults, is not that much different to when I grew up except that there has been a continual material assault on the poor, working class, people of colour, that makes their lives materially more impossible. But that\u2019s not a question of identity to me, that\u2019s socioeconomics.\u201d\nWriting and talking about his experience, which he is clear \u201cdoes not fetishise or commodify black bodies for entertainment\u201d, has come at a cost to his mental health. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s cathartic; catharsis implies purging and that didn\u2019t happen. I can just see it clearly now,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it will be like for us in 30 years or whether we will be happier. What I do know is that it will be different.\u201d\n There Will Be No Miracles Here is published by Profile (\u00a316.99).

        "content": "Toulouse have shown signs this season of regaining the eminence they enjoyed in the formative years of the European Cup but they were given a reminder in draughty Dublin of how far they have to go as the holders, Leinster, moved to the top of the group with a bonus point victory.\nLeinster were without a host of their Ireland internationals. The fly-half Johnny Sexton was among those watching from the stand and his replacement, Ross Byrne, ran the game adroitly, alert to opportunity and creating his side\u2019s second try 10 minutes after the interval with a perfectly weighted cross-kick for Dave Kearney.\nLeinster led 10-6 at the break despite opting to play into the wind. They needed to be patient against an organised defence that was alert to turnover opportunities and most of the half was played in Toulouse\u2019s territory. One move from the home side went through 38 phases and there is no team better than Leinster at not being deflected from a gameplan, one reason why they are able to absorb the loss of leading players.\nThe first 30 minutes were uncompromising, Byrne\u2019s early penalty quickly cancelled out by Thomas Ramos. Toulouse struggled to use the wind to their advantage and were restricted to sniping. One counter-attack, from the centre Sofiane Guitoune, opened up Leinster but Yoann Huget knocked on.\nLeinster pounded away, opting for line-outs rather than kicks for goal, and were rewarded after 34 minutes when a pass to Adam Byrne on the right wing opened up the defence. Huget prevented the try but Rhys Ruddock offloaded to Jack Conan to score at the second attempt.\nRamos\u2019s second penalty gave Toulouse something to take into the break but the physical toll of virtual all-out defence forced them to use all their forward replacements before the hour. Kearney\u2019s try gave Leinster a cushion, one they inflated after 59 minutes when Sean Cronin finished off a series of drives to all but secure victory.\nIt became a question of whether Leinster could secure a bonus point. They did so with less than five minutes remaining after Toulouse had enjoyed their best period of the afternoon. The holders soaked up the pressure, forced a penalty at a ruck and were quickly awarded a second. Jamison Gibson-Park took it quickly and Adam Byrne sprinted from the halfway line to take the scoring pass on Toulouse\u2019s 22. Cheslin Kolbe secured the scantest of consolation for Toulouse with the final move of the match but a clash between the two most successful teams in the tournament was won decisively by Leinster, who are on course for a home quarter-final.",

        "content": "In May 2017, the FBI opened an inquiry into whether Donald Trump was working on behalf of Russia, the New York Times has reported.\nCiting unnamed former law enforcement officials, the paper reported on Friday that in the days after the president fired FBI director James Comey, law enforcement officials were so worried about his behavior that they began investigating whether the president was working against US interests and on behalf of Moscow.\nCounterintelligence investigators were reportedly considering whether Trump\u2019s actions constituted a national security threat, an extraordinary line of inquiry against a sitting president. They also sought to determine whether the president was knowingly working for Russia, the report said.\nTrump responded on Saturday morning with a volley of tweets which did not question the Times\u2019 reporting but lambasted \u201cthe corrupt former leaders of the FBI\u201d for opening an investigation \u201cfor no reason & with no proof\u201d.\n\u201cFunny thing about James Comey,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEverybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop.\u201d\nOf the leaders who opened the investigation, Trump claimed without offering evidence that \u201calmost all [were] fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons\u201d.\nHe then accused special counsel Robert Mueller of protecting Comey and made familiar attacks on Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation for failing to go after \u201cthe Real Collusion (and much more)\u201d of Democrats with Russia in the 2016 election.\nThe Times report quoted private House testimony from Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who worked for Mueller and who with fired FBI agent Peter Strzok has been a target of Republican ire.\nComey, who last year published a bestselling memoir and has become a strident critic of Trump, responded on Twitter on Saturday.\n\u201cI ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made,\u201d he wrote, slightly misquoting Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who actually said \u201cMy friends, judge me by the enemies I have made\u201d in a speech in Portland, Oregon in September 1932.\nFDR's words are familiar in political circles. Six years ago, when he was still a property mogul and reality TV star, Trump tweeted them himself.\nOn Friday, responding to the Times story, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: \u201cJames Comey was fired because he\u2019s a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI.\nMcCabe, who was fired just short of retirement in March last year, will publish his own book next month. Trump mentioned all four of his FBI b\u00eates noires in another Saturday tweet.\nSanders continued: \u201cUnlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.\u201d Trump echoed those sentiments on Saturday.\nRudolph Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s attorneys, also sought to downplay the significance of the FBI investigation, telling the Times: \u201cThe fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing.\u201d\nIn an interview with CBS Face the Nation due to be broadcast on Sunday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, director of the CIA at the time of the Comey firing, said the Times report was \u201csilly on its face and not worthy of a response\u201d.\nThe remarkable report is sure to ramp up the pressure for a White House already feeling the heat from months of investigations. In August, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of financial charges and later pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice. Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and aide Michael Cohen is set to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to fraud, campaign finance violations and lying under oath.\nManafort was charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Mueller shortly after Comey\u2019s firing in May 2017 to lead the investigation into Russian meddling and ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Mueller is reportedly also investigating whether the president tried to impede the investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the election.\nIt was reported this week that Rosenstein will soon step down. Trump\u2019s acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker remains in place despite controversy over his view of the Russia investigation and qualifications for the role. The nominee to become attorney general, William Barr, is also the subject of debate about his fitness to oversee Mueller\u2019s work.\nMueller took over the FBI counterintelligence investigation, the Times reported, just days after it was first opened. FBI spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe report may also raise new questions for congressional investigators looking into Russian meddling. Newly in control of the House of Representatives, Democrats have vowed to further scrutinize Trump\u2019s Russia ties.",

        "content": "Leveraged loans are ringing alarm bells for regulators who fear a repeat of 2008\u2019s mortgage disaster\nWhen an expert in financial risk at one of the world\u2019s most powerful private equity outfits tells investors to scale down their exposure to a specific corner of the debt market, it is worth taking notice.\nHenry McVey, who sits on the risk committee at KKR, said last week that the leveraged loan market \u2013 a $1.3tn (\u00a31tn) pile of risky corporate loans \u2013 had been on a \u201cgreat run in recent years\u201d but the firm was now cutting its exposure to the asset class to zero.\nMcVey is not alone in his caution. A growing chorus of global leaders spent 2018 warning that the leveraged loan mountain was getting dangerously large and inviting comparisons with the financial crisis a decade ago.\nThe Bank of England, Australia\u2019s central bank, the International Monetary Fund and members of the US Federal Reserve have raised red flags over so-called leveraged loans, which are offered to companies already in debt but often come with few strings attached.\nIn October last year the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, which monitors the health of the financial system, pointedly raised the spectre of the 2007-08 credit crunch. It said the \u201cglobal leveraged loan market was larger than \u2013 and was growing as quickly as \u2013 the US sub-prime mortgage market had been in 2006\u201d.\nAs with the sub-prime crisis, the bank added, underwriting standards had slipped \u2013 in other words, risky corporate debt was too easy to get right now. \u201cGiven the decline in underwriting standards, investors in leveraged loans are at increasing risk of loss,\u201d said the Bank.\nThe key question now is whether a bubble in a different corner of the debt market could trigger a market panic. \u201cA quote wrongly attributed to Mark Twain fits here: history rarely repeats, but it does rhyme,\u201d said Rasheed Saleuddin, a research associate at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Judge Business School.\nWhile he said it was hard to see the next financial crash coming directly from a failure in the leveraged loan market, Saleuddin added that there was a chance that \u201csmall changes in default rates in the loans or even in expectations of same could cause a meltdown\u201d.\nIn the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, banks were so keen to lend that they liberally handed out mortgages to customers with weak or no credit histories who ended up defaulting when times got tough. Those mortgages had been bundled together and turned into investable products, causing a chain reaction of losses that spread like wildfire throughout the financial system and caused a global downturn.\nA decade later, rather than doling out risky loans to homeowners, banks are handing out leveraged loans to indebted companies. Many are also \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d, meaning they come with fewer strings attached for borrowers, and as a result, present greater risk for lenders.\nBut since most loans are sold on and packaged as collateralised loan obligations, or CLOs, there are fewer incentives to impose strict terms. Leveraged loans also come with floating rates, making them more attractive for investors, who receive higher interest payments when rates rise.\nAmir Amel-Zadeh, an associate professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, explained that investors in leveraged loans, loan mutual funds and CLOs could face higher losses than investors in the same products during the 2008 crisis due to lower lending standards, an increase in covenant-lite loans and higher levels of corporate indebtedness than 10 years ago.\nBut while the trends in the CLO market were similar, he said the scale was nowhere near the mortgage securitisation market in 2008 \u2013 at about a tenth of the size. \u201cSo at first sight it is not as worrying from a systemic risk point of view. However, if economic conditions worsen, it can lead to losses for many investors and lead to a similar dry-up in liquidity in these instruments as we have witnessed with sub-prime mortgage securitisations during the 2008 crisis.\u201d\nReports have already emerged that the market for CLOs may be cooling, as uncertainty grips financial markets. With fewer investors lining up to take a slice of the leveraged loan market, prices have dropped, and banks have been postponing sales of leveraged loans to investors as a result. \u201cIf banks have to keep the loans on their books they will be exposed to the price risk,\u201d Amel-Zadeh said.\nWithout a hungry market to sell leveraged loans to, banks may be less willing to lend so liberally to indebted companies. And without further loans to feed their debt habits, companies could be at risk of default. This particular debt market will be one to watch in 2019.",

        "content": "We all cling to beliefs despite the evidence. Immersive theatre experience The Justice Syndicate aims to show why\n\u201cIt\u2019s her word against his,\u201d says a middle-aged male juror in thick-rimmed glasses. \u201cSomeone of his experience wouldn\u2019t do something so risky.\u201d A woman to my right says the defendant is probably guilty, but maybe not beyond reasonable doubt. \u201cBut why would she lie?\u201d asks another female juror.\nEleven strangers and I are discussing whether renowned children\u2019s surgeon Simon Huxtable tried to rape Sally Hodges, the mother of a former patient. She says he tried to kiss her and then force himself on her. Huxtable says Hodges made up the allegation after he spurned her advances. Mobile phone records show he was at her home for 26 minutes but he told police he was there for only 10. His browsing history reveals he has an interest in rape porn.\nI fiddle with a yellow label that says I\u2019m juror number 11. Except I\u2019m not really. The witnesses are actors, and we\u2019ve been watching their testimonies on tablets at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry. The case is fictional, but shared pretence is engaging and our deliberations become heated.\nThe Justice Syndicate is part interactive play, part psychology experiment developed by audience-centric Newcastle theatre group FanSHEN and Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King\u2019s College London. It explores how we form and change opinions, our tendency to stick to initial instincts and how groups influence our views. De Meyer hopes that data gathered during the shows and their immersive nature will generate new insights into human decision-making.\nIt\u2019s a subject we surely need to understand better. On Monday, protesters jostled and yelled at Tory MP Anna Soubry in Westminster, calling her a \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cscum\u201d because of her pro-Remain stance. Across the Atlantic, divisions appeared to deepen still further as Donald Trump and leading Democrats traded insults over his demands for a wall on the Mexican border. The increasingly polarised and hostile nature of public discourse raises important questions. If humans have the capacity for reason, why do we make so many bad decisions? How come people cling to extreme or irrational views in the face of facts? And can psychological insights lead to better, more rational decisions?\nThe starting point for many who grapple with these questions, including those behind The Justice Syndicate, is the work in the 1950s of American social psychologist Leon Festinger. Based on a basic human desire to be consistent, Festinger said we compare ourselves to others to evaluate our own opinions and abilities, and that those in groups with diverging opinions will either seek to move towards consensus, ostracise individuals with opposing views or form entrenched factions.\nHe also outlined how, when humans hold contradictory ideas, or their actions conflict with their beliefs, they suffer a form of mental discomfort called cognitive dissonance. His PhD student Elliot Aronson fleshed this concept out, showing how this is especially likely to lead to poor decision-making when it concerns something that is important to our self-image. \u201cIf I see myself as someone who is smart, competent and kind, and you give me some information that I have done something foolish, immoral or hurtful, I have a choice,\u201d says US social psychologist Carol Tavris, co-author with Aronson of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me). \u201cI can revise my view of myself, or I can dismiss the evidence. Most people take the least painful path and dismiss the evidence.\u201d\nThese pressures can lead to confirmation bias \u2013 the tendency to pay attention only to information that confirms our existing beliefs. It is perhaps the best known of human biases. During the 1970s, Nobel prizewinning psychologist Daniel Kahneman outlined a series of other mental shortcuts that can lead us astray. The \u201cavailability heuristic\u201d, for example, may mistakenly convince us that car travel is safer than flying. A \u00a3100 pair of jeans might seem like a bargain if reduced from \u00a3200, even if they cost \u00a32 to make, thanks to the \u201canchoring effect\u201d. And the \u201crepresentativeness heuristic\u201d can mislead gamblers into thinking they are due a win following a string of statistically unrelated losses. Kahneman went on to outline how the brain uses rapid, intuitive processes to make some decisions and slow, more conscious and deliberative processes for others.\nSome argue our cognitive biases only look strange if we see human reasoning individualistically. French cognitive psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber argue in their 2017 book The Enigma of Reason that as highly social animals, we are deeply concerned with appearing to be wise, competent and trustworthy to others. Our reasoning capabilities therefore evolved not to reach the most logical solutions to problems but to help us argue our case and justify our positions. \u201cWe are constantly justifying ourselves and seeking to persuade others that we are the kind of person they want to cooperate with,\u201d says Mercier, of the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris. \u201cFrom this perspective, it makes no sense to hold on to arguments that contradict your point of view, but it does make sense to have a confirmation bias.\u201d\nIn a 2015 study, Mercier asked participants to tackle a series of reasoning tasks, and provide justifications for their choices. When later asked to evaluate their own statements disguised as those of others, more than half disagreed with themselves.\nPolitical polarisation has been a hot topic since 2016, the year Britain voted to leave the EU and Donald Trump moved into the White House. De Meyer, however, has been tracking the phenomenon since George W Bush\u2019s narrow victory in the 2000 presidential election, through the rise of the Tea Party movement, anti-Barack Obama sentiment and the rumbling acrimony over climate change.\nAware of the insights psychology had to offer, he and film-maker Sheila Marshall produced the 2016 documentary Right Between Your Ears, which featured American Christian radio host Harold Camping and his followers, who believed that God would gather up his chosen few and then destroy the Earth with huge earthquakes on 21 October, 2011. It captures the intensity of the cognitive dissonance suffered by believers, who had left their jobs and sold their homes, on realising the end had not in fact been nigh.\nThere have been some 20 Justice Syndicate shows since early 2017. The software on which it runs also gathers research data, tracking how consistent participants are when asked three times during the piece which way they are leaning, and how long they view pieces of evidence for. An initial analysis of recent shows found that almost half of participants failed to change their initial leanings at all, despite the introduction of new evidence.\n\u201cIndividuals take very different views on what bits of information are important,\u201d says Joe McAlister, the computational artist who developed the software. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me that people have a lot of different and unusual biases, which is fascinating but also quite terrifying.\u201d The allegations of sexual assault made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and US judge Brett Kavanaugh both affected Justice Syndicate debates and verdicts. McAlister says younger participants have focused more strongly on issues of consent.\nRecent failures to repeat experiments that support important concepts in psychology have led to a loss of confidence in the discipline. Some blamed the use of highly artificial decision-making tasks for this \u201creproducibility crisis\u201d. De Meyer believes interactive theatre can produce more realistic results. \u201cIt allows us to recreate something with a certain level of realism, and opens up doors to do psychological research in a new way that we couldn\u2019t do 20 years ago.\u201d\nOthers seem to agree. In December, De Meyer and FanSHEN produced a new piece, commissioned by the Cabinet Office, to probe people\u2019s reactions to a national power grid failure. Work on a scenario about someone dying due to medical negligence will begin next month. De Meyer wants to use the format to study why people are more likely to blame those of different ethnic groups to themselves for errors.\nHe also hopes his work can help explain rising political polarisation. Research by US thinktank the Pew Research Centre shows a growing gulf in the views of Republicans and Democrats on key topics such as race, the environment and the role of government. Another study shows Americans increasingly dislike or even loathe those who support the party they themselves oppose.\nMany blame social media for fanning the flames of division. \u201cThe way people use social media and select their own online news sources keeps them in their own little confirmation bias bubbles,\u201d says Tavris. \u201cTweets go viral when they really resonate with a group or really anger a group,\u201d says De Meyer. \u201cSocial media seems to be amplifying existing divisions and probably making them worse.\u201d\nPsychology offers insights, both to individuals who want to make better decisions by learning about their own reasoning powers, and those seeking the secrets of persuading others. In a 2014 study, Mercier and colleagues found only 22% of participants could solve a reasoning task on their own, but when small groups discussed their thinking, this rose to 63%. \u201cIf people are reasoning on their own or only with people they agree with, nine times out of 10 they will stick to biased positions and you are going to get polarisation,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you take a group of people with some kind of common incentive but who disagree about something, then reason can help them get a better answer.\u201d\nBack in our mock jury room, and an initial show of hands reveals that, after hearing the evidence, we see Simon Huxtable as guilty by a slim majority or 7-5. \u201cShe was drunk and upset,\u201d argues juror number four, a young male. \u201cBut what would she have to do for people to believe her?\u201d asks a female jury member, who adds a not guilty verdict would send out the wrong message to other victims. \u201cHis sexual fantasies, however extreme, are irrelevant,\u201d says a male juror. \u201cWe need to focus on the facts of the case.\u201d\nAnother vote shows that 10 minutes of discussion has shifted opinion to 7-5 for not guilty.\nAt this point, I notice a matriarchal juror across the table is speaking both frequently and sensibly and that many participants are looking in her direction when they speak. She is arguing with increasing conviction that the evidence against Simon Huxtable is merely circumstantial. A short while later, we vote again, reaching a not guilty verdict by 10-2. During a debriefing session, Dan Barnard of FanSHEN describes some or the psychological concepts underpinning the show and encourages us to consider how they affected our decisions.\nThe show\u2019s creators believe greater understanding of the mental triggers that affect our own decisions and those of others could help us all become a little more open-minded, tolerant and rational. \u201cThe most powerful form of learning is experiential,\u201d says De Meyer. \u201cMy hope is that by making people aware of how they are thinking and behaving, it helps them to deal with real situations in which emotions and instincts might otherwise take over.\u201d\nThe Justice Syndicate is running on 9 February at the National Justice Museum, Nottingham; 11-23 February at the Battersea Arts Centre, London; and 14 April at the Pleasance theatre, Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh international science festival\n1.

There were 3,525 people from member states awarded qualified teacher status (QTS) in 2017-18, which allows them to work in most state and special schools. A 25% fall on the previous year, it included a 17% drop in applicants from Spain, an 18% drop from Greece and a 33% drop from Poland.\nThe fall comes after repeated warnings of a staffing shortage. Last summer the Education Policy Institute said that teaching shortages would become severe, with bigger classes and falling expertise as a result.\nRecruitment targets were missed last year for all subjects except biology, English, history and physical education. Teacher-training applications are also down last month compared with a year earlier, according to the National Association of Head Teachers.\nIan Hartwright, senior policy adviser at the union, said: \u201cWe found from our work that there is no evidence to suggest they [EU teachers] are displacing UK teachers \u2013 in fact, they were probably filling gaps and mitigating a recruitment and retention crisis in teaching here and positively improving the lives of young people in England and the UK.\u201d\nModern languages could be among the subjects most affected by the fall in European applications to teach in England, he added.\nThe Labour party said plans for a post-Brexit immigration policy with a salary threshold of \u00a330,000 for visa eligibility would hit teaching.\n\u201cThe Tories have created a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention and their shambolic Brexit negotiations are making things worse,\u201d said shadow schools minister Mike Kane.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Education said: \u201cThere are more than 450,000 teachers in schools across the country \u2013 that\u2019s over 10,000 more than in 2010.

        "content": "The bestselling author on sobriety, living with mental illness, and what she\u2019d write in a letter to her 12-year-old self\nBryony Gordon, 38, is an author and journalist who has championed mental health awareness in her books and newspaper columns for the Daily Telegraph. Her first memoir, The Wrong Knickers (2014), was a bestseller. It was followed by the acclaimed Mad Girl (2016), about her battles with obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia and addiction. Her third book, Eat, Drink, Run, is about training for the London Marathon and setting up a mental health support group, Mental Health Mates. She lives in Clapham, London, with her husband and daughter.\nYou interviewed Prince Harry about his struggles with mental health for the Mad World podcast in 2017, and in the new book you say that you got stopped on the street by people who had heard it and appreciated what he had said. Does this still happen?\n  Yes, which makes me sound like I\u2019m Madonna! It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t buy a pint of milk without being mobbed, but I get stopped a couple of times a day not just because of the Prince Harry interview, but by people who say that what I have written has resonated with them. When I look at my last book, Mad Girl, it doesn\u2019t feel radical now, but when it came out two years ago people weren\u2019t talking about mental health in that way.\nYou founded Mental Health Mates in 2016 so that people would feel less alone and be able to talk to each other. Do you think the stigma around mental health has lessened and that we have begun to have more open conversations about it?\n  There\u2019s an idea that because high-profile people like Prince Harry and Lady Gaga have spoken about it that the box has been ticked. Obviously, more people are having this conversation, but there are still a hell of a lot of others who are too terrified to have it.\nIn terms of speaking to each other about mental health, there\u2019s so much further to go, and the notions we [as a society] hold around mental health are still quite reductive. For me, the area that really needs to be addressed is child mental health. It\u2019s key to address it at an early age. Most mental health problems are treatable.\nWhat do you think about the way that Meghan Markle\u2019s entry into the royal family has played out in the media, especially the apparent fractures between her and Kate?\n  I have met Meghan a few times and I think if you put any family under the microscope, things will come up. I find the media stories are based on a style of journalism that is on its way out, or I thought was on its way out: a nasty pitching of two women against each other who I think get on really well.\nYou\u2019ve run the London marathon for two consecutive years. Are you still running?\n No, I haven\u2019t run for a while. In the summer, the sun put me off, but now I\u2019m beating myself up about it. Every night I say to myself \u201cMaybe tomorrow.\u201d But I also realise that there will be periods when I\u2019m running and periods when I\u2019m not. I walk a lot these days.\nYou haven\u2019t touched alcohol for 16 months, after an addiction to it. How has day-to-day life changed?\n It\u2019s immeasurably good; so much better, in fact. There are times when it\u2019s hard, but no harder than the alternative. It\u2019s bloody difficult to have an active addiction to alcohol \u2013 the stuff you put yourself through! Not drinking is a doddle compared with that. If I ever start fantasising about having one drink, I know the reality would be 85 drinks and a gram of cocaine.\nMy publishers wanted me to write about getting sober, but I said no, because I wasn\u2019t ready to write that book yet. I think it\u2019s really important not to mine parts of your life willy\u2011nilly; it\u2019s got to be real and heartfelt. Mad Girl was an act of desperation \u2013 to find people like me \u2013 and the stigma attached to talking about it meant I just didn\u2019t meet people who were doing it.\nThe next book you\u2019re working on is a mental health guide for teenagers. What inspired that?\n I realised I really wanted to write a letter to the 12-year-old me. A lot of the time when I went into rehab, the counsellors would ask me how old I felt, and I would say \u201cOh, 11 or 12.\u201d I wish that the things I\u2019m learning now, people could have told me about when I was 12.\nI wouldn\u2019t give back any of my experiences, even if I think a lot of them were unnecessary, but I just wish I had known some life lessons then \u2013 some of the things that I think are amazing but no one speaks about, like masturbation, and \u201cgirl crushes\u201d, which are really normal. I explored my sexuality and then thought I couldn\u2019t tell anybody; but shame is such a dangerous emotion, and so I want to write this book.\nWhat would you have been if you hadn\u2019t become a journalist and author?\n I would probably have been dead. I\u2019m not saying \u201cpoor me\u201d \u2013 the reality is that I\u2019m fucking lucky. It\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019m here, given my self-destructive and addictive behaviour. The most important thing I have realised is that no one is better than anyone else. We are all fundamentally good and a bit flawed. I think that embracing your flaws is the closest you get to perfection.\nWhat are you reading?Educated by Tara Westover, which is fascinating; also Bonjour Tristesse by Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and The Lost Properties of Love by Sophie Ratcliffe. Since I got sober, reading has been a real joy for me, because before, I\u2019d get into bed drunk and then not be able to concentrate the next morning because of the hangover. Now I read!\nDo you read aloud to your daughter? What are her favourite books?\n  Yes, we read to her a lot. We\u2019re reading her Michael Rosen\u2019s poems at the moment. She\u2019s five and has just learned to read, which is a joyous thing to watch her do.\n Eat, Drink, Run by Bryony Gordon is published by Headline (\u00a37.99).

On Sunday, day 23, members of Congress were out of Washington, Donald Trump was unmoved in the White House, his border wall unbuilt, and around 800,000 federal workers were still without pay and facing mounting hardship.\nFrom a White House he described as empty, Trump complained on Twitter about multiple reports in the press that his administration is in chaos, lacking a plan to end the impasse.\n\u201cI do have a plan on the Shutdown,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cBut to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cWe will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their \u2018vacations\u2019 and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!\u201d\nTrump has however repeatedly pledged to veto legislation initially supported by both parties to reopen the government, without funding for his wall.\nFriday was the first payday of the year for federal workers and contractors affected by the closure, some at home, some forced to work. Some paychecks turned up blank. Contractors may not recoup lost earnings. As callouts rose among workers deemed essential, so did problems for government programmes, for courts, national parks and vital transport and infrastructure services including major airports.\nEven White House staffing is severely affected, prompting Trump to complain in a tweet: \u201cThere\u2019s almost nobody in the WH but me.\u201d\nOn Saturday the shutdown passed the 21-day mark set when Bill Clinton faced a Republican Congress in 1995 and 1996. Nine of 15 cabinet-level departments were not funded. Earlier, Trump backed away from threats to declare a national emergency and build the wall with money appropriated from military, water management and disaster management funds, among other sources.\n\u201cWe want Congress to do its job,\u201d the president said in a discussion on border security at the White House. \u201cWhat we\u2019re not looking to do right now is national emergency.\u201d\nNonetheless, Trump insisted he had the right to declare an emergency if he chose to, and continued to insist there was a crisis at the border.\n\u201cOther presidents have called national emergencies for lesser importance than this,\u201d he told Fox News in an interview on Saturday night.\nDemocrats reject Trump\u2019s insistence there is a crisis and continue to prepare a response to an emergency declaration that would involve recourse to the courts.\nThe impasse is over the $5.7bn needed for a wall on the border with Mexico that Trump promised on the campaign trail, saying Mexico would pay for it. Democrats who control the House are determined not to give it to him, whether or not \u2013 and most analysts say not \u2013 he is correct that savings from a new trade deal will mean Mexico pays after all.\nThe White House has suggested building the wall with steel rather than concrete as a key concession.\n\u201cThis is where I ask the Democrats to come back to Washington and vote for money for the wall, the barrier,\u201d Trump said on Friday. \u201cWhatever you want to call it, it\u2019s OK with me. They can name it whatever, they can name it peaches.\u201d\nDemocrats, who oppose any wall as a matter of principle, are not buying that. They point to polling that indicates support for their opposition to Trump on the wall and other immigration matters, and to remarks by Trump in December in which he said he would be proud to force a shutdown.\nIn a statement on Saturday, the Connecticut Democratic senator Chris Murphy said \u201cthis was already the dumbest shutdown ever\u201d.\n\u201cThe only reason we are shut down is that President Trump wants it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear about how we got here. Back in December, the White House endorsed a bipartisan deal that passed the Senate with unanimous support \u2013 and then Republicans changed their mind.\u201d\nRepublicans who control the Senate will not pass legislation to reopen parts of government advanced by Democrats in the House, knowing Trump will not sign it, but feel relatively sheltered from blame thanks to the president\u2019s intransigence. Majority leader Mitch McConnell has maintained a studious if increasingly controversial silence.\nSome moderate Republicans have seemed to waver. Trump has not. But as he remains in the White House, after a short visit to the border this week, the pressure is rising: not only from the shutdown but also from continued revelations in the special counsel\u2019s Russia inquiry and as House committees prepare to investigate his actions.\nAccording to S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, the shutdown has cost the US economy $3.6bn, a toll that will exceed Trump\u2019s funding demand in two weeks\u2019 time.\nThe National Weather Service is among government agencies affected by the shutdown. But enough forecasters remain on duty to say that the capital is about to be hit by a major snowstorm. Members of Congress were sure to leave town to avoid it.",

        "content": "Not many people leave early to avoid the traffic when Norwich City play this season. Jordan Rhodes\u2019s late equaliser against West Brom made it the eighth straight league game in which they have scored in the last 15 minutes. All of them have changed the result, this one earning a 1-1 draw in an absorbing contest between two of the Championship\u2019s promotion favourites.\n\u201cI would prefer a boring 2-0 sometimes,\u201d said the Norwich manager, Daniel Farke. The point means they drop below Sheffield United and out of the automatic promotion spots, with the gap between them and the leaders, Leeds, extended to four points after the surveillance enthusiasts beat Derby on Friday night.\nStill Farke was happy with the point against an accomplished West Brom team who would have gone above his side with a victory. Albion, playing their first game since Harvey Barnes returned to his parent club Leicester, did not seem to miss the influential winger when they took the lead after 12 minutes, the Everton loanee Mason Holgate curling a brilliant cross to the near post where Dwight Gayle nipped in front of the Norwich defence to stab home his 14th goal of the season.\nHolgate was fed by Rekeem Harper, a hugely talented 18-year-old who was making his full league debut. He was a striker until about three years ago and converted into a midfielder after the West Brom academy manager, Mark Harrison, saw something of Patrick Vieira in him \u2013 not that that meant much to Harper; he had never seen Vieira play. \u201cHe showed maturity levels beyond his age,\u201d said West Brom\u2019s manager, Darren Moore, afterwards.\nNorwich seemed sluggish in the opening half-hour, their passing slightly too slow, their creativity a little awry, and had only one chance of note before the break when Teemu Pukki forced a fine save from Sam Johnstone. \u201cWe weren\u2019t confident enough,\u201d said Farke of how his team began the game. \u201cI got the feeling we were a bit too impressed with the atmosphere and the big names West Brom had. We had three or four players coming back from injury, so they maybe needed 20 to 25 minutes to get past their rusty start.\u201d\nNorwich looked more lively after the break, Johnstone again having to save well from Pukki while Onel Hern\u00e1ndez lashed a shot just over the bar. The home side, too, had their chances, notably one from Gareth Barry that was pushed away by Tim Krul, but by midway through the half their play had become more disjointed, their failure to score a second while on top in the first-half looking as if it might be costly.\nIt was odd that Moore failed to make a substitution as the game became scrappy in the second half but Farke did and two of his moves paid off instantly. Rhodes has been largely kept out of the team by Pukki this season but scored with his first touch after coming off the bench, turning home a cross at the near post from his fellow substitute Kenny McLean. \u201cHindsight is a great thing after the event,\u201d said Moore of his reticence to make a change. \u201cThey gambled and it paid off.\u201d\nWest Brom head to a warm-weather training break in Dubai on Monday which, it must be hoped, will be less eventful than the last one, during which late-night japes ended with four players commandeering a Barcelona taxi and Alan Pardew being relieved of his phone and wallet.\nIdeally they would have departed with three points in the bag but, despite the late concession, Moore was delighted with how his team played. \u201cNo way can I be disappointed with that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great performance against high-level opposition.\u201d",

        "content": "For a game of such magnitude in the fight for survival, a bore draw was an unwelcome outcome for both parties yet Huddersfield left the Welsh capital aggrieved at what might have been. Lee Mason, the referee, awarded Huddersfield a penalty with 14 minutes to play after Joe Bennett brought down Florent Hadergjonaj. But when his assistant flagged to inform Mason that Hadergjonaj had in fact fouled Bennett, the referee reversed his decision.\nCardiff may have failed to register a shot on target, or the win they craved, but Huddersfield look doomed. David Wagner\u2019s side face Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal in three of their next four games and this was a 10th consecutive match without victory. They are eight points adrift of safety while no team in Premier League history has avoided relegation after accumulating only 11 points by this stage of the season.\nIt may be barely mid-January but both Wagner and Neil Warnock acknowledged the pain at passing up the chance to gain three points here. Huddersfield have been drinking in the last chance saloon for a while, arguably since November \u2013 when they last tasted victory \u2013 but Wagner fumed at the match officials for removing a lifeline in their battle against the drop.\n\u201cI have no clue what was in their heads in that moment,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI think they struggled to try to repair [the decision] what they have done. The whole situation makes absolutely no sense. I have seen the video footage and I have to say that it was a clear pen.\n\u201cIt would have been the clearest-cut chance of the whole game and they took it away from us. We will probably receive another phone call from the FA this week, where they will apologise for the referee\u2019s decision, but this doesn\u2019t help us.\u201d\nHuddersfield may have stopped the rot after nine consecutive defeats and probably shaded play, though both teams mustered only half-chances. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing was Cardiff\u2019s catalyst and, after skipping away from Erik Durm, he whipped a delicious ball into the box, where Junior Hoilett and Hadergjonaj collided. The latter did not appear to win the ball cleanly. \u201cI suppose you could say justice was done in that respect,\u201d Warnock said.\nHuddersfield have scored only 13 goals this season, the fewest in the division, and again came up short in the final third. Cardiff, too, were blunt in attack, with Warnock turning to Rhys Healey, fresh from a loan spell at MK Dons, midway through the second half. Kenneth Zohore could return at Newcastle next weekend but Warnock is still desperate to bolster his front line and the club\u2019s chairman, Mehmet Dalman, insists a deal for the Nantes striker Emiliano Sala is not dead. \u201cIt stuck out like a sore thumb that we needed something up there,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the chairman has ever worked so hard to get me players.\u201d\nChances were few and far between and, when they did arrive, they often ended in farce, such as when Sol Bamba bounced into Sean Morrison to stop Elias Kachunga latching on to the ball with Huddersfield pouring forward, four against two on the counterattack.\nBut the true drama arrived late on, when Bennett and Hadergjonaj tangled inside the box. After a brief conversation with his assistant, Mason gave the hosts a free-kick, presumably for a foul on the Cardiff left-back before he upended Hadergjonaj. Wagner fumed on the touchline but Cardiff had survived. Huddersfield will do well to do the same.",

        "content": "When your luck\u2019s out, it\u2019s out. Relegation-haunted Fulham must have thought they were in with a chance when they got off to a dream start at Turf Moor with a sensational goal after two minutes, only for two own goals in quick succession to put Burnley in control before Claudio Ranieri even had a chance to speak to his players about protecting their lead.\nBurnley were therefore able to climb the table without finding the net or even having a shot on target, though that does not necessarily mean Fulham were victims of any cruel misfortune. Sean Dyche\u2019s team reacted positively to going behind at such an early stage and spent most of the first half pressuring the Fulham goal. It was only the identity of the scorers that was harsh on a side looking for their first away win of the season.\nA home player might have claimed a goal when Chris Wood beat Sergio Rico to a Phil Bardsley cross but slapped his header against an upright. Fulham were not clearing their lines particularly well and, when Dwight McNeil\u2019s cross from the left ran through to Jeff Hendrick on the right, the midfielder\u2019s driven ball across goal was diverted over the line by Joe Bryan\u2019s knee.\nThat only encouraged Burnley to keep going forward and, though the second own goal had some comedy value when Denis Odoi seemed to appear from nowhere to head Hendrick\u2019s cross past a startled Rico, it was the home side\u2019s passing and movement that led to Hendrick finding space in the area after starting the move 30 yards out.\n\u201cYou need a bit of luck now and again,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cI was really pleased with the calmness we showed after going a goal down, we\u2019ve won our last two games by coming from behind and that feels like a big step forward.\u201d\nBurnley were well on top at that point and Fulham were looking at familiar failings, which had not been the case in the second minute when Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle opened the scoring with a goal of the highest class. There appeared no particular danger when Odoi launched a long ball into the Burnley box from 10 yards behind the halfway line but Sch\u00fcrrle\u2019s immaculate first touch created the scoring opportunity and left Ben Mee a mere spectator. Extending his right leg to cushion the ball as it fell from the sky, Sch\u00fcrrle had it under control in an instant, letting it bounce once before whacking a dipping shot over and beyond Tom Heaton.\nIt was quite a start, though one the travelling supporters at the cricket ground end probably suspected might not last. At least Fulham revived somewhat in the second half, enjoying more of the game and almost finding an equaliser when James Tarkowski had to clear Luciano Vietto\u2019s shot off the line.\nTom Cairney made a difference when he came on and Burnley had to put in their share of last-ditch defending, with Heaton producing a diving save to keep out a Vietto effort from the edge of the area.\nAt times Fulham overstretched themselves, sending too many men forward and inviting their opponents to strike on the counter, though Burnley are too one-paced to be effective on the break.\nWhat they are good at once again, after appearing to lose the habit in the first half of the season, is dogged defending. Mee and Tarkowski safely saw out the game, earning Burnley a third successive league win and leaving Fulham to ponder what might have been.\n\u201cIt\u2019s football, what can you do?\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI was quite pleased with the performance but not the result. We deserved a draw but ended up with two own goals and a shot cleared off the line. It was very strange.\u201d",

And completely relieved.\u201d\nNext year Searle plans to be in the centre of Antarctica sending a similar message. She is planning to break the women\u2019s world speed record for skiing solo to the south pole, unassisted and unaided, with Rudd as her expedition leader. \u201cIt will be a huge challenge but I think everyone\u2019s got one big adventure in them.\u201d\nSearle will need to ski 702 miles across the frozen continent in less than 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes. \u201cI can\u2019t have any outside assistance and I have to take everything with me in a special sledge called a pulk: all my food, my fuel, my supplies, everything. I can\u2019t have any food resupplies or medical help. I cannot even accept a cup of tea,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be completely alone and, in all likelihood I won\u2019t see anybody else.\u201d\nSearle is 5ft 5in tall and weighs just over 60kg; the pulk will weigh over 80kg. As training for the expedition, she is spending more than 10 hours a week lifting weights and running up and down hills pulling a tyre, while also holding down a full-time job in the Ministry of Defence press office.\nKnowing how difficult and dangerous the trip is going to be forces Searle to prioritise it. \u201cWhen you know that, if you don\u2019t do your training, one day that might be the difference between success and failure, then it\u2019s a huge motivator.\u201d\nHer family \u2013 her husband is a soldier and they have three teenage daughters and a nine-year-old son \u2013 are doing all they can to support her. \u201cMy children are super-independent, and they do a lot of managing upwards. They\u2019ll say, \u2018don\u2019t forget parents evening and these are the appointments I\u2019ve got you\u2019. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d She is determined to show them that following your dreams is worth doing. \u201cI want my children to think: if you pursue things with a passion, you will achieve the results you want to. I want them to see that it\u2019s OK to pursue something with a white-hot passion in a single-minded way and focus on a goal.\u201d\nFive years ago, Searle had never considered crossing the Antarctic. Then she managed the media campaign of an expedition to the south pole by a team of military personnel. \u201cI became hooked.\u201d\nShe discovered the first woman hadn\u2019t set foot on Antarctica until 1935, even though men had been going there for 100 years before that. It made her wonder if she could have a go herself. \u201cBeing around the pole community made it seem like a totally normal idea.\u201d\nDespite the fact that she\u2019d had no previous polar training and had never skied before, she successfully skied 350 miles across the Greenland ice sheet last year. \u201cOne thing I learned is that my polar expedition is going to be incredibly tough, mentally. I definitely missed my children. But all I could think at the time was: no one day has been as bad or is ever going to be as bad as the six months I spent pretty much on my own in Germany when I was 25. My husband was away fighting in Iraq, I had a house, a dog and three children under four I was solely responsible for, and six months of just absolutely relentless grinding tiredness.\u201d\nAs a woman, she faces certain physical challenges. \u201cIf you\u2019re going for a pee in the Antarctic it is decidedly easier from a logistics point of view to be a guy. Periods are also a massive issue.\u201d She will take medication to stop herself menstruating.\nTraining for her adventures has changed who she is as a person. \u201cDoing things that push me beyond what I thought I might be able to do, that has become a huge part of my life. I can\u2019t imagine not doing those things now.\u201d Searle is still raising money to fund the \u00a350,000 expedition and hopes to raise a further \u00a350,000 for charity. She says it is more difficult to attract sponsorship as a female polar explorer. \u201cPeople need to get behind female adventurers. I asked a well-known TV agent why she doesn\u2019t have more of us on her books and she said: \u2018Honestly, there just isn\u2019t the market for it.\u2019 I\u2019ve heard people in bookshops looking for adventure titles say: \u2018Oh no, I don\u2019t want to read anything by a woman.\u2019\u201d\nThis kind of sexism is a vicious circle, she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not seeing women and mothers going on expeditions and doing amazing things, then how do you know women do that?\u201d But they do, she says \u2013 she is part of a community of would-be female adventurers joining groups such as Adventure Queens or Love Her Wild.\nSearle hopes her story will change perceptions about who should be doing polar travel and is dismayed by the number of women she meets who tell her they could never do what she is doing. \u201cThey say that without even stopping to think about whether they could. I\u2019ve got four kids and a full-time job. If I can do it, why can\u2019t they?\u201d\nBut she adds: \u201cI think there\u2019s definitely a groundswell of women who want to go out and have adventures. They\u2019re doing cool stuff, they just don\u2019t shout about it. They don\u2019t need that validation.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Cold case documentary casts new light on mystery of Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane crash\nNew evidence has emerged linking an RAF veteran to the death in 1961 of the UN secretary general Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in a mysterious plane crash in southern Africa.\nJan van Risseghem has been named as a possible attacker before, but has always been described simply as a Belgian pilot. The Observer can now reveal that he had extensive ties to Britain, including a British mother and wife, trained with the RAF and was decorated by Britain for his service in the second world war.\nFilm-makers investigating the 1961 crash for a documentary, Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld, have found a friend of Van Risseghem who claimed the pilot confessed to shooting down the UN plane. They also gathered testimony from another pilot that undermines one of his alibis for that night.\nVan Risseghem, whose father was Belgian, escaped occupied Europe at the start of the war to join the resistance in England. He trained with the RAF and flew missions over Nazi-held areas. During this period he met and married his British wife, cementing a lifelong connection.\nAt the end of the war the couple returned to Belgium, but by 1961 Van Risseghem was in the Congo, flying for separatist rebels who had declared independence for the breakaway province of Katanga. There, the documentary claims, he was ordered to shoot down a plane carrying Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who was on a secret midnight journey to try to broker peace. The film will premiere at the Sundance festival in two weeks.\nIt was not clear at the time of the crash, which also killed all 15 people travelling with the secretary general, if it had been caused by sabotage or was a tragic accident. More than half a century later the UN is still investigating what happened on 18 September 1961. But as news of Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death emerged, the RAF veteran was apparently an obvious suspect. He was named as the possible attacker by the US ambassador to the Congo, in a secret cable sent the day of Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death and only recently declassified.\nFor decades, Van Risseghem appeared to have proof that he wasn\u2019t flying in the region on the night Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane, the Albertina, came down outside Ndola in Zambia, then called Northern Rhodesia.\nFlight logs \u2013 meticulous records of where and when he flew \u2013 appear to show Van Risseghem was not flying for most of that month, returning to duty only on 20 September. However, Roger Bracco, another mercenary flying for the Katangese, told filmmakers that his colleague\u2019s logbooks are dotted with apparent forgeries.\nHe does not believe that Van Risseghem shot down Hammarskj\u00f6ld. But when asked in an interview for the film if he considered the logbook a fake, he responds: \u201cI won\u2019t say so, but \u2026 I didn\u2019t recognise the story [it told].\u201d Leafing through the book, he later directly accuses Van Risseghem of forgery. \u201cThis is fake,\u201d Bracco says bluntly of one flight destination, and goes on to add that some of the names listed for co-pilots are not real.\nA friend has also come forward to claim that, less than a decade after Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death, Van Risseghem told him he had attacked the plane. Pierre Coppens met Van Risseghem in 1965, when he was flying for a parachute training centre in Belgium. Over several conversations, he claimed, the pilot detailed how he overcame various technical challenges to down the plane, unaware of who was travelling inside.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Coppens said. \u201cHe said \u2018I made the mission\u2019 and that\u2019s all. And then I had to go back and save my life\u2019.\u201d\nVan Risseghem died in 2007. Surviving relatives, including his widow and niece, say he was not involved in any attack. His widow told the Observer that he was in Rhodesia negotiating the purchase of a plane for Congolese rebels and the logbooks provide proof that he was not flying for Katanga at the time.\nVan Risseghem was never interviewed by the authorities or journalists directly about the death of Hammarskj\u00f6ld, but it is clear that he followed news about it closely. In an interview with an aviation historian Leif Hellstr\u00f6m in the 1990s, he returns to discuss the crash and details of an official enquiry repeatedly. He emphasises that he was not in southern Africa at the time it happened, and describes the idea of an attack as \u201cfairy stories\u201d.\n Andreas Rocksen co-produced, and Mads Br\u00fcgger directed, Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld.",

        "content": "Exclusive research reveals that a British-trained Belgian mercenary admitted the killing of Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in 1961\nJan van Risseghem was only a teenager when his mother ordered him to flee Nazi-occupied Belgium for her native England with his brother Maurice. After hiding in a convent, and an epic journey across the war-torn continent, they reached safety in Portugal, then took a ship north.\nOnce in England, the pair signed up with the Belgian resistance, and with the help of an uncle enrolled for flight training with the RAF, a decision that shaped not just their war, but the rest of their lives.\nHalf a century later, flying skills he learned in Britain would also make the younger van Risseghem internationally notorious, when he was publicly linked to the plane crash that killed Swedish diplomat Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the UN secretary general, in 1961.\nHis plane, the Albertina, came down in forest just outside the town of Ndola in present-day Zambia, then Northern Rhodesia, just after midnight on 18 September, as it approached the town\u2019s airport.\nFifteen people on board died immediately, and the only survivor in hospital a few days later. The same day, a US ambassador sent a secret cable \u2013 one that stayed buried in files for decades \u2013 speculating about possible sabotage and apparently naming Van Risseghem as a suspect.\nBut his name would not be connected with Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s in public until many years later, after the Belgian pilot had returned to his quiet hometown of Lint with his British wife, raised two sons and mourned the death of one, retired, and then died a war hero himself.\nThis may be because, as the initial shock and suspicions about Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death gradually faded, so too did interest in the crash.\nRumours about why the plane came down were fuelled by no less a figure than former US president Harry Truman. He told reporters two days after Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death that the UN leader \u201cwas on the point of getting something done when they killed him. Notice that I said \u2018when they killed him.\u2019\u201d\nHe refused to elaborate, but it was the start of decades of suspicions that western governments were not sharing all the information they held about the crash.\nSeparate inquiries \u2013 including one by the UN, and another by Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s native Sweden \u2013 failed to provide a compelling explanation of what happened, all blaming pilot error or reaching an open verdict.\nIt took nearly 50 years, and publication of a damning book by academic Susan Williams, Who Killed Hammarskj\u00f6ld?, for the UN to start asking that same question again, rekindling doubts about the attack from conspiracy theorists who had picked over it for decades.\nAmong the critical evidence gathered by Williams and independent researcher G\u00f6ran Bj\u00f6rkdahl is testimony from a former US spy, posted to a listening station in Cyprus, who heard a recording of a pilot apparently narrating the attack as it unfolded, transmitted just minutes after it happened.\nIt matches accounts collected from Zambian witnesses living around the crash site, who said they had seen a second aircraft near Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane and unusual lights and sounds in the sky. They had been largely ignored by white officials working on the early inquiries. The sole immediate survivor of the crash also described some kind of aerial attack, involving \u201csparks in the air\u201d before he died a week after the crash. Doctors said he was lucid at the time, but his testimony had also been largely ignored.\nHammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s death happened amid a post-colonial race for resources in Africa. On his final flight, he was heading for a secret meeting to broker an end to the civil war in recently independent Congo, mineral-rich and on the brink of collapse.\nThe eastern province of Katanga, home to most of the country\u2019s vast deposits of ore \u2013 including the uranium ore used to make the bomb that America dropped on Hiroshima \u2013 and source of much of the country\u2019s income, had declared independence the previous year.\nRebel leader Mo\u00efse Tshombe had covert military and technical backing from the Belgian government, the former colonial power, and support from western mining firms with interests in the area. Hammarskj\u00f6ld believed the UN had a duty to intervene because Katanga\u2019s secession posed an existential threat to Congo.\nA champion of decolonisation and an implacable idealist who believed the UN should be protector and platform for small countries, he over-ruled the reservations of the UN\u2019s legal adviser to order military action to end the rebellion, infuriating Britain and the US. But UN troops had been outmanoeuvred and a group were now under siege. In a bid to end the standoff and the conflict, Hammarskj\u00f6ld was flying to a secret meeting with Tshombe when he died.\nJan van Risseghem had landed a new job in the middle of this febrile conflict in early 1961. He would have been comfortable in a war zone, after his dramatic escape from Europe, and his service in the resistance and the wartime RAF.\nCharismatic and handsome, he was the younger son of a British woman from an aristocratic family that traced its roots back to before the Norman conquest, and a Belgian father. Jan van Risseghem was born in Germany, and the family later returned to the Belgian town of Lint.\nIt was, by all accounts, an idyllic upbringing. Photos show the brothers playing in large gardens, fishing with their mother, while their father was a more quiet presence because of injuries he suffered in the first world war.\nDespite this childhood reminder of the horrors of conflict, the brothers plunged into service themselves, proving to be assets to the Belgian resistance and the RAF with their fluent English, French and Flemish, and knowledge of the continent.\nService nurtured a lifelong love of flight. Jan always wanted to be in the air. \u201cFlying was part of him,\u201d says niece Marianne van Risseghem, who recalls exhilarating flights with her uncle decades later, when he worked for an aerial surveillance company in Belgium.\nHe left military service after the war, and joined Belgium\u2019s civilian airline, Sabena. But he was fired after he fell out with them about security, he told aviation historian Leif Hellstr\u00f6m in an interview recorded in the 1990s, and took a job in Katanga.\nHe told Hellstr\u00f6m that he was officially hired as a civilian trainer for pilots in Avikat, as the rebel air force was called, but he described a much wider range of responsibilities. He recounts meetings with rebel leader Tshombe where he described himself as \u201cyour air commander\u201d, discussed how transport planes were modified to be used for bombing raids and recounted discussions about the feasibility of attacking major cities. He even remembers designing a logo for his Avikat squadron.\nPierre Coppens, who got to know Van Risseghem four years later when he was back in Belgium flying for a parachute training centre, said his friend told him those unspecified wider tasks also included attacking Hammarskj\u00f6ld. He said he was simply ordered to bring down a plane and didn\u2019t know who was inside, Coppens told researchers working on a new film about the crash, Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld. It premieres at the Sundance film festival in two weeks\u2019 time, and names Van Risseghem as the attacker. Full details of the filmmakers\u2019 research are revealed here for the first time.\nThose details emerged over many conversations, in bars or waiting for the rain to clear, and Coppens was sceptical at first, he said. Just slightly too young himself to have fought in the second world war, he was used to older men regaling him with tall stories of conflict. \u201cAt the start I was believing it was a joke,\u201d he says. But he eventually came to think his friend was utterly serious.\nBy his own account Van Risseghem had rare skills in the cockpit. He claimed he could get \u201can iron with wings\u201d into the sky, and told Hellstr\u00f6m he was one of just a handful of pilots on the rebel air force who could fly in the dark. And in his daring escape from the Nazis, followed by years of service, he had shown he had the courage for an audacious mission, such as a night-time attack that would take his plane to the limits of its range.\nCoppens said Van Risseghem laid out the details of a complicated, logistically challenging plan. He used a Fouga Magister jet \u2013 the last one remaining to rebel forces after one was seized by the UN and another destroyed in a crash.\nHe stripped out everything he could from the plane, making room to install a cannon for the attack, and reducing weight to increase his range, he told Coppens. He added extra fuel tanks and left from the airport at a a town called Kipushi, far closer to Ndola than other airports, but not previously considered as a possible launch site for an attack because its short dirt runway posed a huge challenge for a jet to take off from.\nIt was a day or two before he found out who he had killed, Coppens claimed. He had only asked his friend once if he ever felt remorse for the attack. \u201cHe said: \u2018Well, in life, sometimes you have to do things that you don\u2019t want to do, but they are an order\u2019,\u201d he remembers.\nVan Risseghem\u2019s surviving relatives have always insisted that the man they loved would not have been involved in the attack. Through a niece, his wife that he was in Rhodesia negotiating the purchase of a transport plane when the attack happened.\nMeticulously kept flight logbooks also appear to show that he was not flying at all at the time. They show Van Risseghem grounded for the first three weeks of September, after he was forced to return to Belgium.\nThe film-makers, however, have uncovered evidence that the flight logs were filled with false names, meaning they had been doctored by Van Risseghem or with his knowledge. That makes it harder to rely on them as accurate accounts of dates or times, and is particularly striking because the pilot himself insisted years later they were a meticulous record of every hour he spent in the air. Van Risseghem insisted to Hellstr\u00f6m that his documents were scrupulously maintained. \u201cIt was not a Boy Scout sort of outfit. It was thoroughly done as it should be done. So every hour [was noted] in my log book,\u201d he said of his time with Avikat.\n\u201cI was not having any of this hanky business, where you do a flight and don\u2019t register it,\u201d he said in the interview, which Hellstr\u00f6m taped and shared years later with researchers.\nFellow mercenary pilot Roger Bracco does not think Van Risseghem shot down the plane, but has said his log books appear to contain false names of both pilots and places. He has identified at least one he did not recognise, \u201cDelone, G\u201d, listed on many fights. Asked if a pilot could have been operating in the area for Katangese forces without Bracco hearing of him, he replied: \u201cImpossible.\u201d\nSince the UN reopened its inquiry, further evidence has been unearthed, including the US diplomatic cable that names Van Risseghem (misspelled as Vak Risseghel) as a suspect.\nIt has also emerged that at least one US plane with powerful radio surveillance capacity was on the tarmac at Ndola that evening. Transcripts of any radio recordings America holds, from the Albertina or its attacker, could settle once and for all the questions about Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s fate \u2013 and whether Van Risseghem had a role.\nBut while the US has admitted it has further evidence in classified files, it has so far declined to share it with the UN, despite repeated requests from the new commissioner.\n This article was amended on 15 January 2019 to remove a mistaken reference to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.\n Andreas Rocksen co-produced, and Mads Br\u00fcgger directed, Cold Case Hammarskj\u00f6ld.\nFons Feyaerts contributed reporting",

        "content": "Dua Lipa is the most nominated artist for a second year in a row, joined by Essex pop star Anne-Marie on four nominations\nDua Lipa has become the most-nominated artist at the Brit awards for a second year in a row, underlining her status as one of the UK\u2019s biggest pop stars this decade.\nAfter being nominated for five awards in 2018 and winning two, for British female and British breakthrough artist, the British-Kosovan singer is nominated four times in 2019 \u2013 though admittedly just for two hit songs. IDGAF, taken from her self-titled debut album last year but still eligible for this year\u2019s awards, was nominated for British single and British video, with One Kiss, her summer smash hit with Scottish producer Calvin Harris, also nominated in the same categories.\nHer tally of four nominations is matched by 27-year-old pop singer Anne-Marie, who as well as getting song and video nominations for her hit 2002 \u2013 co-written by Ed Sheeran \u2013 is also nominated in the more prestigious categories of British female and British album.\nLike Lipa, whose breakthrough came after a few years of fitful popularity, Essex-born Anne-Marie began guesting on dance tracks back in 2013, but she has steadily developed into a chart-dominating solo star. She sang the 2016 Christmas No 1, Rockabye, produced by Clean Bandit (the pop group who are nominated twice this year for their song Solo) and earned her first Brit nomination in 2017, for British breakthrough. Other major collaborative hits followed, including Friends with US EDM producer Marshmello, and she was nominated for her second Brit in 2018 for her song Ciao Adios. Her album Speak Your Mind became 2018\u2019s biggest-selling debut in the UK (though only the 26th highest seller overall).\nGeorge Ezra, whose album Staying at Tamara\u2019s was the second-biggest selling of 2018 after The Greatest Showman soundtrack, has three nominations, for British album, British male, and British single for Shotgun, which spent 12 weeks in the Top Three over the summer. As the only artist with one of the ten biggest-selling albums of the year in the male and album categories, his sheer success and cross-generational appeal means he will be a strong favourite to win both.\nAlso with three nominations is versatile neo-soul singer Jorja Smith, who won the Critics\u2019 Choice award in 2018, as voted for by a panel of industry experts \u2013 this year\u2019s winner has already been announced as Tyneside singer-songwriter Sam Fender. Smith\u2019s debut album Lost & Found is nominated for the British album award, and she also picks up nominations for British female and British breakthrough.\nThe other nominees for British female are Florence + the Machine (another best album nominee), Lily Allen and Jess Glynne. The latter singer, who in 2018 became the British woman with the most chart-topping singles ever in the UK, picked up another nomination for her No 1 single I\u2019ll Be There. She also appears on the twice-nominated These Days by dance group Rudimental, but the nebulous rules defining lead and featured artists mean that she does not share their nomination.\nGuitar-pop group the 1975 scored two prominent nominations, for British group and British album, though Arctic Monkeys were snubbed in the latter category and only scored one nomination.\nA strong year for north American music, particularly rap, meant that only two of the 15 international category nominees were not from the US or Canada: First Aid Kit and Christine and the Queens. Rap superstars including Drake, Eminem, Travis Scott and Cardi B were all nominated \u2013 as was Jay-Z with wife Beyonc\u00e9 in the group category \u2013 but there was also room for cosmic jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington.\nIn a lineup dominated by major label talent like Lipa, Glynne, Ezra and Anne-Marie, there were some other interesting curveballs, including the 14-strong hip-hop boyband Brockhampton, nominated for best international group despite none of their songs ever reaching the UK Top 100.\nImpassioned Bristol punk group Idles were nominated for British breakthrough alongside the poppier Mabel, Ella Mai, Tom Walker and Jorja Smith, while Cornish electronic experimentalist Aphex Twin was nominated alongside Ezra, Sam Smith, Craig David and Giggs for best British male, his fourth ever nomination.\nPerhaps disappointed to miss out in that category will be Calvin Harris, who topped the singles chart twice in 2018 and was rated by Forbes as the highest-earning DJ in the world for the sixth year running, though he does have two nominations for One Kiss with Lipa. Some of the year\u2019s other biggest selling album artists, including Take That, Rod Stewart, Post Malone and Michael Bubl\u00e9, all failed to secure a single nomination.\nThe nominations are all drawn from votes by the Brits Academy, made up of industry and media figures \u2013 except for the best British singles, which are the 10 biggest selling of 2018, and the videos, which are the most viewed of 2018 on YouTube and Vevo. The singles shortlist is then voted on by the Academy along with the rest of the awards, apart from the video award, which is voted for by the public.\nBritish male\nSam Smith\n Craig David\n Aphex Twin\n Giggs\n George Ezra\nBritish female\nFlorence + the Machine\n Jorja Smith\n Anne-Marie\n Lily Allen\n Jess Glynne\nBritish single\nCalvin Harris & Dua Lipa \u2013 One Kiss\n George Ezra \u2013 Shotgun\nRudimental \u2013 These Days (feat.

        "content": "The data shows there is a wide gender gap in the US when it comes to prison sentences for killing a partner\nCyntoia Brown was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for a man she killed when she was 16 years old.\nThis week though, Brown was granted clemency by the Tennessee governor after appeals by her lawyers claiming that she was a victim of sex trafficking who feared for her life. Brown, now aged 30, will remain on parole supervision for 10 years so long as she retains a job and participates in regular counseling sessions.\nThe man Brown killed was Johnny Allen, who had taken her to his house that night and paid her for sex. Though he wasn\u2019t her partner, the case prompted me to look at the gap between sentencing of men and women who kill intimate partners in the US.\nStatistics cited by the ACLU and the Women\u2019s March suggest a wide gender gap in sentencing. The average prison sentence for men who kill their female partners is two to six years (the illustration here takes the midpoint of those values). By contrast women, who kill their partners are sentenced on average to 15 years.\nDespite its widespread use, the statistic is dated. It was first published by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in 1989. It remains true that most women who kill their partners cite self-defense as a motive. In fact, 70-80% of incarcerated women report intimate partner violence. But there doesn\u2019t appear to be any recent analysis of sentencing to see if this gender gap in sentencing remains the same.\nSince the statistic was first published, one of the clearest changes in the US prison system has been the dramatic increase in women\u2019s incarceration rates. Research also suggests that women are given harsher punishments when they have committed crimes that are perceived as more masculine, such as murder.\nMore recent statistics from other countries suggest that intimate partner violence committed by men continues to be treated with leniency. In Ireland, men who are convicted of the manslaughter of current or former partners serve an average of 2.8 years less time in jail than other men convicted of the same charge against people who were not their partners.\nThis is a column that illustrates numbers from the news each week.

        "content": "Liverpool did not sparkle here but, more importantly, nor did they wobble. After losing their unbeaten record to Manchester City they returned to winning ways thanks to a second-half penalty by Mohamed Salah. It was a narrow victory but one that restores Liverpool\u2019s seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League and challenges City to close the gap again when they host Wolves .\nDefeats in their two previous matches led to this being billed as a particularly revealing interrogation of Liverpool, with a team aspiring to be champions required to give persuasive answers. The questions ranged from the elementary to the tricky. Could Liverpool\u2019s confidence really be so brittle that a narrow loss at City and a practically invited one at Wolves in the FA Cup would cause it to crumble despite half a season of domestic invincibility prior to that? Answer: No.\nWhat about their ability to cope with the pressure of a title race when their closest rivals have undoubted pedigree? Their response was positive. They will be asked it again over the remaining 16 matches of the campaign.\nAnd what of their depleted defence, which, owing to a spate of injuries, included the midfielder Fabinho here alongside Virgil van Dijk? When Trent Alexander-Arnold collapsed during the warm-up it looked like J\u00fcrgen Klopp would be forced into further improvisation but, after having his ankle strapped up, the right-back declared himself fit enough to play. He played well, as did Fabinho despite a lapse in the 15th minute that allowed Glenn Murray a free header from 12 yards. The striker sent his effort over the bar.\nThat was Brighton\u2019s only chance in a first half when they spent most of the time entrenched behind the ball in a rigid 4-5-1 formation. This, then, was not a test of Liverpool\u2019s makeshift defence as much as of their creativity. They flunked it in the first period but never lost patience.\nTheir play from the start was slow and predictable, almost entirely in front of the hosts. Many times this season there has been a disconnect between their defence and attack and usually Xherdan Shaqiri has helped bridge the gap, with Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum industrious but not ingenious.\nShaqiri started in a role that allowed him to flit about but he struggled to get involved, although he did have the visitors\u2019 best chance in the first half, nodding wide from 10 yards after a cross from the right by Alexander-Arnold.\nLiverpool\u2019s full-backs were their most penetrative players, as Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9 tended to get bogged down in overly intricate moves in congested central areas.\nIt would have been interesting to see at what stage Klopp might have varied the approach but, as it turned out, there was no need for him to do so because Brighton suddenly played into Liverpool\u2019s hands. A mistake by Martin Montoya early in the second half presented them with an opportunity to launch the sort of rapid counterattack at which they excel. Salah needed no second invitation, hurtling into the box and letting fly with a low shot that David Button did well to hold.\nTwo minutes later, Pascal Gross made an even more costly blunder, oafishly fouling Salah in the box. \u201cI feel for Pascal because Salah is probably the most dangerous player when he gets into those situations,\u201d said Chris Hughton, who had no quibble with the decision to award a penalty. Salah\u2019s conversion left no room for doubt, either, the Egyptian ramming the spot-kick beyond Button and into the corner of the net to claim his 14th league goal of the season.\nThe onus was on Brighton to vary their approach and subject Liverpool\u2019s defence to a more vigorous test. Hughton made a double substitution in the 65th minute in an effort to give his team more attacking impetus, though the hosts never committed fully to attack.\n\u201cBrighton defended like they defended because they knew that one mistake from us and they were back in the game and not making a mistake is difficult,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cBut we did it.\u201d\nWith 20 minutes to go J\u00fcrgen Locadia cut in from the left to unload a 20-yard shot, possibly going wide, that Alisson pushed around the post. But that was as dangerous as Brighton got.\nLiverpool found more vibrancy as the game loosened up and had chances to make their lead more comfortable in the 75th minute but Button batted away his swerving long-range shot. Wijnaldum then flashed a low shot inches wide from the edge of the box after a nimble build-up involving Salah, who missed a much better chance in the 87th minute, dragging a shot wide from seven yards after a pull-back by James Milner.",

        "content": "The last thing Claude Puel needed on the back of a humiliating FA Cup exit was a third home defeat in four Premier League matches. That Southampton played for 45 minutes with 10 men, following the dismissal of Yan Valery, added insult to injury on another chastening afternoon for the Leicester manager, who, once again, finds himself under the spotlight.\nThe headline statistic is that Leicester are eighth in the table, yet that fails to tell the full story of their season. Puel\u2019s decision to field weakened teams in the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup has done him no favours and the booing that greeted the final whistle provided a reasonable barometer of the mood. One elderly fan even had a \u201cPuel Out\u201d placard removed before a ball had been kicked.\nIt is 18 days since Leicester beat Manchester City at home, hot on the heels of an impressive victory at Chelsea, yet those results already feel like distant memories. They have lost against Cardiff and Southampton at home since and been dumped out of the FA Cup by Newport County, who are in the bottom half of League Two.\nPuel had come out fighting before the game, yet it was his former club who delivered the blows that mattered. James Ward-Prowse converted from the spot and Shane Long, moments after Valery had been sent off, doubled Southampton\u2019s lead in first-half injury-time.\nAlthough Wilfred Ndidi pulled a goal back just before the hour mark and Leicester dominated thereafter, Southampton defended with tremendous determination and courage, epitomised by the performance of the excellent Jannik Vestergaard, and held on for the most precious of victories. They are now out of the bottom three and have a favourable run of matches to come.\nLeicester\u2019s run of fixtures is not as obliging, although maybe that will help a team that rarely looks comfortable when trying to break down opponents who sit deep and apply what Puel described as \u201ca deep block\u201d.\nAsked whether he feels under pressure, Puel replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not my concern, no comment. I\u2019m just focused and concentrating on my team. I want to work with these players. The fans are like us \u2013 disappointed and frustrated. We wanted to give a good response after the FA Cup against Newport.\u201d\nBright from the outset, Southampton got off to a great start. Nampalys Mendy, who endured a miserable afternoon and was withdrawn at half-time, clumsily brought down Long as the Southampton forward ran on to Stuart Armstrong\u2019s pass. Kasper Schmeichel got his hands to Ward-Prowse\u2019s penalty but was unable to keep it out.\nThe first half was drifting and felt a little flat until Valery picked up the first of his two yellow cards for a high and late challenge on Ben Chilwell, who was also booked for his reaction. Wes Morgan had a shot cleared off the line by Jan Bednarek from the free-kick that followed but that was a rare Leicester chance in a first half that finished in dramatic fashion.\nThe clock had just ticked into the 45th minute when Valery was caught the wrong side of Marc Albrighton and pulled the midfielder back, giving Michael Oliver, the referee, little option but to brandish a red card. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl admitted he feared the worst at that point, but Southampton\u2019s day got better.\nAlex McCarthy punted upfield, Ricardo Pereira\u2019s header was wayward and Mendy allowed Long to pick his pocket. With the angle against him, the Southampton striker tried to curl his shot into the far corner and Schmeichel inadvertently turned the ball into his own net. It was his first goal for nine months.\nNdidi\u2019s close-range finish, from Pereira\u2019s cut-back, gave Leicester hope, but Southampton were in no mood to surrender.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of this fantastic team,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cThe way we defended, with the passion and the mentality, was incredible.\u201d",

        "content": "Alleged victims may never get the answers they seek about former coach who was set to face trial for child abuse\nOf all the many unanswered questions, there is one that leaps out in particular: why, 15 minutes before he was due to start the first day of his trial for multiple child-abuse charges, was the former football coach Kit Carson driving on a country road 45 miles from where he was supposed to be?\nThe difficult truth is that his alleged victims may never get the answers they seek about why, rather than taking his place in the dock at Peterborough crown court, he was behind the wheel of his red Mazda on the A1303 between Cambridge and Newmarket and, for reasons as yet unexplained, driving in completely the wrong direction.\nCarson was supposed to be facing a trial for sexual offences against 11 boys over a 31-year period and allegedly using his position within football as a veil for his crimes. Instead he never made it to the court and at 9.45am on Monday, with the jury waiting to be sworn in, his car left the road and hit a tree. No apparent skid marks, according to the journalists and photographers who have visited that straight stretch of road, but tyre tracks showing he had travelled some distance over the grass verge in a straight line. Carson was pronounced dead at the scene.\nFor now, all that can be said is that it is an incredible coincidence of timing. Incredible coincidences do happen, but this one has clearly been very hard for some people to accept. Freedom From Abuse, one of the organisations tackling child abuse, has used its Twitter account to describe Carson as a coward and it is certainly true that some of the people who were due to give evidence against their former coach are asking themselves whether it was a genuine accident or if there was something more to it. Of course they are. And, if you were in their shoes, wouldn\u2019t you?\nAs you can imagine, that does not make it a particularly easy subject to write about and, for the time being, it seems to me that the best policy is to wait for the post-mortem and try not to jump to conclusions, when it will be for the coroner to decide what happened on that quiet stretch of road near Bottisham, five miles out of Cambridge.\nOne theory being investigated by detectives is that Carson, who was 75, had mixed up the date of his trial and believed it was starting on Wednesday. Indeed, he took a call from the court asking why he was not there and, in response, gave the impression he was on his way. Could it be that he was confused, agitated and under considerable stress and all that played a part in what then occurred?\nIt still leaves a significant question about the direction he was travelling \u2013 directly east when Peterborough, from where he lived in Cambridge, was 40 miles north-west \u2013 but it is not my place to pre-judge an inquest, just as it would be wrong to assume a guilty verdict from the trial. Carson\u2019s name will remain synonymous with football\u2019s abuse scandal but he died, in the eyes of the law, an innocent man, with nothing ever proven.\nAll of which must be shattering for the former players who had reported Carson on the back of the \u201ctidal wave,\u201d to quote the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, caused by Andy Woodward waiving his anonymity in November 2016 to expose the Barry Bennell scandal. The police have spent two years building their case against Carson and the charges took in offences from as far apart as an alleged indecent assault in 1978 to a count of inciting a 13-year-old boy into sexual activity in 2009.\nCarson worked as a youth developer at Norwich, Peterborough, Cambridge United and Histon FC, as well as scouting for Chelsea and running his own development centre, and it needs only a cursory look at his list of discoveries within the sport to realise why he was once regarded among the best in the business.\nAt Norwich, the players he brought through included Craig Bellamy, Ruel Fox, Chris Sutton, Tim Sherwood and Danny Mills. For Peterborough, there was Matthew Etherington and Simon Davies and the story about how the owner, Peter Boizot, decided to buy the club because he was so impressed by the conduct of Carson\u2019s players at a fundraising event.\nCarson was so highly regarded in the Barry Fry regime he had a 10-year contract and, speaking to FourFourTwo in October 1999, said he had turned down offers from three top-division clubs because \u201cI couldn\u2019t shit on Barry, if you will excuse the language\u201d.\nTottenham were one. Chelsea did eventually recruit him, as a regional scouting coordinator for East Anglia, and Carson also had strong links to youth football in Finland and Denmark. He took hundreds of players on tours abroad and had a website claiming: \u201cI probably know more about European grassroots soccer than almost any other youth developer in England, having travelled to European nations with soccer teams well over 500 times.\u201d The website had testimonies not only from Bellamy and Etherington but also Dan Ashworth, until recently the FA\u2019s technical director. Ashworth had been Carson\u2019s assistant at Peterborough and Cambridge and known him since being on the books of Norwich, aged 12.\nAgainst that, the case around Carson told of a culture where young footballers were routinely made to strip naked for exercise and body inspections, where he watched boys shower and sometimes woke them in the middle of night to perform this routine. Others have reported being instructed to wrestle in muddy puddles wearing just their underwear, or being told to pair off, remove their clothes, and massage each other with oil.\nCarson had always denied the allegations and was expected to take the line of defence that it was important to see the boys naked to check their muscular development. To which the next question might reasonably have been: was it necessary for them to remove their pants, too?\nHe was charged with 12 offences, all relating to boys under 16, from incidents mainly in Cambridgeshire. One, however, allegedly took place at a hotel in the north-west. Three were at Peterborough\u2019s training ground. Another was in the grounds of a prison and the overall picture is troubling, to say the least, when I have also seen testimony from the FA\u2019s independent inquiry relating to the close links between Carson, Bennell and at least one of football\u2019s other career paedophiles. Carson was prominently involved in the Canary Cup, a junior tournament held annually in Great Yarmouth, where Bennell and the now-deceased Frank Roper used to molest boys.\nMy colleague Steven Morris has been on top of this story since first revealing that Carson was under investigation and has also spoken to a number of players, past and present, who refuse to believe the allegations against their former coach. Ben Coker, who played at Cambridge and is now at Southend, was one. Shortly before Carson\u2019s arrest in January 2017 Coker said the complainants were \u201cjumping on the bandwagon\u201d and that he had been in contact with Carson to offer support. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me angry.\u201d\nExcept I can also remember the \u201cFriends of Barry Bennell\u201d fund that was set up after the first boy came forward, in 1994, to say he had been raped by the former Crewe and Manchester City coach. People were angry then, too. So angry, indeed, that many wrote to court accusing the boy, aged 13, of making it up, of sour grapes and worse because, they said, he was bitter about the fact he was not good enough to make it as a professional footballer. Bennell\u2019s friends and sympathisers raised thousands of pounds for the monster who is now serving a 31-year prison sentence.\nThat is the thing about the people who use football as a means to prey on children: they are clever, they hide their crimes well, they know popularity is a shield and their roles automatically puts them in a position of strength, holding the dreams of those youngsters. Players, coaches, friends, parents and colleagues all get taken in. And if there is one thing I have learned during the last few years investigating the various offenders, it is that they are bloody good at what they do.\nAnd Kit Carson? None of us can claim to know whether he was a calculated, devious paedophile apart from the 11 footballers, now in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, who were willing, one by one, to stand up in front of a jury, face an interrogation from the defence barrister and go through the graphic details of what they allege their old coach did to them. One of the tragedies here is that what happened on the A1303 last Monday means that will always be the case.\nPerhaps you remember the episode of Father Ted when word gets around that he has a habit of standing at his front window and making the kind of straight-armed salute that never looks good in any circumstances \u2013 but particularly for a man of the cloth. All rather unfortunate this story, featuring the kind of rotten luck that apparently seems to inflict some of our Premier League footballers. It turned out there was a perfectly square bit of dirt on the window of Craggy Island\u2019s parochial house. Father Ted just happened to be placed directly behind it, creating the impression he had grown a Hitler-style moustache, as he held up his arm to wave at some visitors. You can probably imagine the rest.\nSome people clearly have no luck and I certainly had to sympathise with Wayne Hennessey\u2019s incredible misfortune after that photograph on Max Meyer\u2019s Instagram account of his Crystal Palace teammates out for a meal, with the goalkeeper striking a rather unexpected pose from the back of the room.\n\u201cYesterday evening I had a meal with my teammates and we had a group photograph,\u201d Hennessey duly explained. \u201cI waved and shouted at the person taking the picture to get on with it and at the same time put my hand over my mouth to make the sound carry. It\u2019s been brought to my attention that frozen in a moment by the camera this looks like I am making a completely inappropriate type of salute. I can assure everyone I would never ever do that.\u201d\nWell, glad that one\u2019s cleared up and what terribly bad luck to be in that position, holding up your arm Nazi-style, the other hand over your top lip, while shouting something at a bloke who just happens to be from Germany. \u201cI believe him totally,\u201d says Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager. \u201cI have no reason to disbelieve it.\u201d Of course you do, Roy, of course you do.\nFrank Lampard was clearly very upset, with some justification, about the discovery of a Leeds employee hiding in the bushes to spy on Derby\u2019s training before the teams played each other at Elland Road on Friday. But don\u2019t think it is only Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager, who would pull such a stunt.\nIn an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2011, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas said he would regularly visit opposition training grounds, \u201coften incognito,\u201d for spying missions as part of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s backroom staff at Chelsea.\nA 3-0 win against Newcastle in November 2005 was referenced, when Villas\u2011Boas provided Chelsea with a dossier containing 24 tactical graphics. Lampard is entitled to be upset with Bielsa \u2013 but maybe he should consider who was wearing the No 8 shirt in Chelsea\u2019s midfield that day.",

But on politics Twitter, at least, the idea that his replacement might be the first daughter was met with widespread derision.\n\u201cOf all the people in US who could be World Bank President,\u201d tweeted California Congressman Ted Lieu, sarcastically, \u201cthe most qualified is Ivanka Trump, who lost her fashion line & happens to be the daughter of @POTUS. I see.\u201d\nThe billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer, who is funding a campaign to impeach Donald Trump and until recently flirted with a White House run, chimed in: \u201cThis is among the most ridiculous proposals I have ever heard. Nepotism is just another form of corruption, so I am not surprised, but the level of absurdity is breathtaking.\u201d\nThe FT did not reveal its source, but stories of impending promotion for Ivanka, a senior adviser to her father, are not without precedent.\nDonald Trump has the power to nominate candidates to the World Bank position and has routinely considered his daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, as possible and actual candidates for all sorts of jobs for which they would not traditionally be thought qualified.\nTrump was reported to have considered Ivanka for US ambassador to the United Nations. In March last year, she effectively acted, if briefly, as de facto interim secretary of state, after Rex Tillerson was fired. She also sat in for her father at a G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017, to widespread consternation.\nIn his bombshell White House-insider bestseller Fire and Fury, the author Michael Wolff wrote that Ivanka aspires to a higher achievement than an appointment from her father: to be the first female US president.\nThe US president does not have the final say on the World Bank appointment, which must be voted on by the bank\u2019s board of directors. But presidential nominations have traditionally led to appointments, as in the case of Kim, who was nominated by Barack Obama in 2012.\nThe bank, founded in 1944, works to promote economic development and poverty reduction by \u201cproviding technical and financial support to help countries reform certain sectors or implement specific projects\u201d in fields like healthcare, education and infrastructure.\nIt has historically been led by figures with multiple decades of governmental, macroeconomic or academic experience. All 12 presidents to date have been men.",

        "content": "Manchester United\u2019s caretaker manager has won his first five games, but the Tottenham side honed by his possible successor represents a step up in class\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s not about him,\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r says, dismissing the notion that his side taking on Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s Tottenham amounts to some sort of audition for the job of next permanent manager at Manchester United. \u201cWe don\u2019t kick a ball at all.\u201d\nHe would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? And so would Pochettino, most probably. Yet even without the background noise that suggests the Spurs manager is the only name in the frame as far as Headhunters United are concerned, Sunday\u2019s meeting at Wembley would still be both a test and an opportunity for a caretaker who has made a flying start.\nThere is no doubt Solskj\u00e6r has made a flying start, because not only is he the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first five games, he is the only top-flight manager for more than a century to do so by a margin of two or more goals each time. He may simply be reaping the benefit of being a fresh and engaging antidote to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s divisive sarcasm, though anyone who has seen United in recent seasons will appreciate that 16 goals in five matches represents the sort of reboot that several coaches with more established reputations could not manage.\nThe argument is already being advanced that United have not really played anyone yet, which while a little insulting to the likes of Newcastle and Cardiff is substantially true. All of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s opponents have come from the bottom half of the table or the Championship, which is why Spurs amount to the first real test.\nSolskj\u00e6r has a point when he says that Newcastle away was a test, as was winning over the Old Trafford crowd in his first home game, but Tottenham have been one of the form teams all season, not just in the last few weeks. With 48 points after 21 games they could normally expect to be even higher than third, as it is they are doing well to remain in touch with the formidable pace being set by Liverpool and Manchester City.\nTottenham were also the team Mourinho mentioned when illustrating the difficulty of regaining United\u2019s dominance. In the old days, he suggested, one or all of Harry Kane, Dele Alli or Son Heung-min might have been running out in red by now. While the point is debatable, there is no denying Spurs have some highly covetable players and a style that many a Premier League side would like to copy.\nThat is where the opportunity lies for Solskj\u00e6r, for he too likes to send out a side to attack, and United supporters will dare to hope that his first crack at a top-four side might not be an exercise in containment and caution. If Solskj\u00e6r can match Pochettino at his own game his coaching stock would rise accordingly, regardless of what may or may not happen next season. The caretaker understands the reason for all the speculation linking the Spurs manager with a move north \u2013 his team plays the way United would like to play. \u201cHe\u2019s done a very good job,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r says. \u201cIt is easier to play in an attacking way when you have the right players.\u201d\nUnited have quality attacking players just waiting to be let off the leash, which is effectively what Solskj\u00e6r has done, rejuvenating Marcus Rashford and Romelu Lukaku. So far so good, but when quality meets quality a little more attention to detail might be required.\nSolskj\u00e6r has been looking at the stats. \u201cWe\u2019ve been managing to outsprint opponents,\u201d he says of his first five games. \u201cBecause we have been playing against teams at the bottom of the table that\u2019s a very big compliment to my players. One of the best compliments you can get as a coach is when the other manager says: \u2018Your boys worked hard,\u2019 and that has been happening. I am pleased to be in charge of a Manchester United side that outruns teams from the lower part of the table. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the stats have improved in the last few weeks because we\u2019ve had a focus on going forward quickly.\u201d\nOutsprinting Tottenham will be a different matter, especially as the peerless Son will play at Wembley before joining South Korea for the Asia Cup in Dubai, but as Solskj\u00e6r and every United follower knows the emphasis on going forward quickly has been missing for some time.\nSir Alex Ferguson\u2019s preference for all-out attack has perhaps been overstated over the years, but even on a restrained day in the glory years United were never as restricted and reactive as they would become under Louis van Gaal and Mourinho.\nThat chapter in the club\u2019s history now appears to be closed, with Solskj\u00e6r specifically recruited because he is committed to the club\u2019s more adventurous traditions. Currently on something of an adventure himself, he has at least reached base camp on the managerial mountain climb by successfully bringing players and supporters into line.\nHow high he can go might not depend on this weekend, even if the United succession will be an elephant in the room at Wembley, but by the time Solskj\u00e6r has played Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool in different competitions over the coming six weeks, the club should have a clearer view of which direction is forward.",

How did that language become offensive?\u201d\nOn Friday, King sought to explain himself on the floor of the House, saying: \u201cOne phrase in that long article has created an unnecessary controversy.

Because we\u2019re silent on things like this.\u201d\nOn Saturday, the CBC chair Karen Bass, a California Democrat, tied King\u2019s views to those of the Republican president, who last year told a rally the congressman \u201cmay be the world\u2019s most conservative human being\u201d.\n\u201cLike Donald Trump,\u201d she said, \u201cSteve King has sought again and again to give comfort to white supremacists, something that should never be allowed in the halls of Congress or the Oval Office.\n\u201cIf Republicans really believe these racist statements have no place in our government, then their party must offer more than shallow temporary statements of condemnation.\u201d\nAnything less than the stripping of King\u2019s committee assignments would represent the \u201ctacit acceptance of racism from the Republican party\u201d, Bass said.\nKing has repeatedly won re-election in Iowa\u2019s fourth congressional district, despite regularly attracting controversy for his far-right views and associations, which stretch to Britain and Europe.\nIn November\u2019s midterms, he won narrowly. This week Randy Feenstra, a Republican state senator, said he would challenge King in a primary in 2020.",

        "content": "In his first major interview since his tearful announcement of imminent retirement, Britain\u2019s tennis great talks of his first-round tie in Melbourne \u2013 and how he\u2019ll cope afterwards\nAndy Murray has been guarding a chronic hip condition for several years, he has revealed in his first major interview since announcing his plans to retire from the game because of injury.\nSpeaking to journalists before what could be his last public appearance on a court on Monday at the Australian Open, the three-time grand slam winner talked of his bitter regret at having to abandon competitive tennis and admitted he had \u201czero interest\u201d in doing anything else.\nHe said: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in pain for a long time, it\u2019s not as simple as, \u2018My pain started at the French Open, I\u2019ve never had hip pain before.\u2019 I\u2019d been in pain for quite a long time beforehand but was managing it and was able to play, so I was thinking, \u2018If my hip improves I\u2019ll be able to go back to competing.\u2019\u201d\nThe 31-year-old said that he had discussed competing again with specialists. \u201cBecause of when I had the surgery and what I was told about the surgery, and the timings of when things can be beneficial, I thought, well I need to wait it out a bit and see.\u201d\nHe looked down, paused and added: \u201cObviously it didn\u2019t help enough. That\u2019s how difficult it was.\u201d\nIf the former world No 1\u2019s match against the Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday is his last public appearance on a tennis court \u2013 as he fears it might be \u2013 he will leave to rapturous applause and the gratitude of a generation. Despite beating Agut in their three previous matches, Murray does not expect to win.\nThe Scot said he was determined to follow advice from psychologists and delay making decisions about what he does next.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stop playing tennis just now,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t feel ready, the rest of my body feels perfect.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the hard thing about it. It\u2019s not like I wake up and my whole body\u2019s sore, and just aching, and it\u2019s too much. It\u2019s just one problem that can\u2019t be fixed. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult. Look, lots of things have been weird. Like, the US Open last year for me was quite odd, because I was in a lot of pain.\u201d\nThere he lost to Fernando Verdasco in the second round. He lost to him again in Shenzhen \u2013 and that was it for 2018 \u2013 12 matches, seven defeats and nothing to show for it but a seemingly ineradicable limp and dwindling hopes after 15 years as a professional.\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve got no chance of winning this tournament and most likely I\u2019m going to lose in the first round. I\u2019m not happy about that. Because of the way the last six months of competing have gone, I could win but it\u2019s likely that I won\u2019t. It\u2019s going to be uncomfortable,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf it is my last match, I want to try and enjoy it \u2013 enjoy the whole experience, which is maybe something during my career that I\u2019ve not done. I\u2019ve always been focused on tactics and winning and finding a way; that\u2019s been the most important thing.\u201d\nWhat Murray wants to do after spending nearly his entire life playing tennis is to have some fun, play five-a-side with his mates, and fit in some golf \u2013 which might have been his chosen sport, if his father, Willie, had had his way, rather than his mother, Judy, who steered him towards tennis.\nHe could have been a footballer. But tennis, with its inbuilt frustrations and challenges, its quirks of scoring and circumstances, suited his mercurial rhythm. It gave him a canvas on which to paint his particular art. Few did it more artfully. Manufacturing a graceful departure has not been easy, though.\n\u201cComing in here, my mindset is\u2026 it feels very different. Like, the other day, I was saying to my team: \u2018The thing that\u2019s difficult \u2013 because I\u2019m not practising anywhere near as much as I used to \u2013 is I can\u2019t just go back on the practice court and work on my serve or whatever I\u2019m not happy with \u2013 I can\u2019t do that any more.\u2019\n\u201cBut it\u2019s interesting because once I\u2019d started thinking about stopping, that there was a possibility that I wasn\u2019t going to be playing much longer, all of the things that I thought I would quite like to do, I have zero interest in doing right now.\n\u201cI have no motivation to do anything else just now. Thinking about what I do when I finish playing and rushing into decisions \u2013 from speaking to psychologists \u2013 is the worst thing I should be doing. It\u2019s going to take time for me to deal with it. I need time to get over it and then to know what my next steps are going to be.\n\u201cI know that will be difficult. I love tennis. I love playing the game.\u201d",

        "content": "Capitol Theatre, SydneyFor a show so predicated on the expansive power of \u2018pure imagination\u2019, the musical based on the beloved children\u2019s book feels impossibly small\nFor a show so predicated on the expansive power of \u2018pure imagination\u2019, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a new musical based on the beloved Roald Dahl children\u2019s book, feels impossibly small.\nOn a compact touring set (designed by Mark Thompson) squarely placed in the middle of the Capitol Theatre, the titular factory feels poky and plastic. If this production was ever lush in its West End and Broadway outings, by downsizing for international touring it has cost it significant lustre.\nBut maybe finding the magic is a case of faith or belief. As Wonka says \u2013 and sings, often \u2013 \u201cit must be believed to be seen.\u201d\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nThis entire production is powered by the grim will of believing. In Australia after critically-panned seasons in London and New York, the musical has been retooled so many times, plot holes patched over and bugs reworked, that the musical arrives hanging on by a thread, swinging between gritted-teeth exoticised Oompa-Loompa kicklines and strained but sincere numbers about the power of daydreams.\nThe story you might remember from childhood is more or less preserved, but its focus here is skewered and conflicting. Willy Wonka (Paul Slade Smith) introduces himself to us as the overture ends, explaining his work, his factory and his desire to retire. He then opens a pop-up chocolate shop in the poor suburban street Charlie Bucket (Ryan Yeates on opening night, cute as a button) and his family call home to get back in touch with the market. Wonka bars are pass\u00e9, Charlie explains. He loves them with the endearing specifity of a child nerd, but other children are less impressed, especially since Wonka doesn\u2019t even advertise on television. Charlie \u2013 a sweet but colourless character \u2013 is frequently overshadowed by this additional time, and spotlight-sharing, with Wonka.\nThe rest, more or less, you know, though writer David Greig has both modernised and complicated the tale: Wonka is inspired to open his factory to children holding one of five golden tickets, hidden across the world in chocolate bars; the first four are won by greedy Augustus Gloop (Jake Fehily, in a truly regrettable fat suit), spoiled Veruca Salt, reimagined as a young Russian ballerina (Karina Russell), gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, a self-styled YouTube celebrity called the \u2018Queen of Pop\u2019 (Monette McKay), and Mike Teavee, an overmedicated, aggressive, gamer addict (Harrison Riley).\nCharlie, after pocketing a dollar from Wonka\u2019s now-closed pop-up, gets that ticket, rejoices with his family. Mr Bucket has long since disappeared \u2013 who is screwing lids on all the toothpaste tubes down at the factory? \u2013 and it falls to Mrs Bucket (an underused, lovely Lucy Maunder), to serve as voice as reason. Her best moment, unfortunately, is an ode to her absent husband and abdication of her own successful, loving parental duties called \u2018If Your Father Were Here.\u2019\nThese new songs and lyrics \u2013 by Broadway powerhouse duo Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray, Mary Poppins Returns) are more hyperactive than precise and more bland than emotional, placed awkwardly against the songs from the 1971 film, and often at odds with the story\u2019s internal sense of pace and time. Still, Joshua Bergasse\u2019s choreography is effervescent and a pleasure to watch.\nThe narrative is clear in its broad strokes but muddled in detail and its smaller moments. Charlie is frequently lost in the noise, running jokes about Mrs Teavee (Jayde Westaby) and her 1950s-style housewife alcoholism and despair feels laboured, and the Oompa-Loompas feel like a dated and unresolved racist stereotype.\nA whole act plays out before we get inside the chocolate factory, and when we finally make it, its toybox size and awkward edible props feel too small and false for us to find room to rejoice about finally getting some strongly plotted, swift-moving action in this purported land of wonder.\nSmith is a high-energy Wonka, playful and diabolical. His performance is well-timed and keenly honed, because he understudied the role on Broadway \u2013 but his casting plays into a larger problem of importing leads in musicals when our own performance community is more than capable of the work; you can\u2019t help wonder, watching him, why any number of affable and melodious homegrown performers were shut out of the role.\nThank the god of chocolate himself for Grandpa Joe. Played by Australian stage legend Tony Sheldon in full Aussie accent and armed with anecdotes about the time he served as a travel agent for Burke and Wills, he just about walks away with the show. It\u2019s all in his attention to detail and million-wattage charisma: the ways he punctuates a line with an arm movement, a tilt of the head and a permanent twinkle in the eye, that makes him lovable even when he\u2019s chewing on the scenery.\nThere are a few other delights \u2013 watching each child (all, except Charlie, are played by adults) meet their ironic fates, Octavia Barron Martin\u2019s joyful Mrs Gloop, the ebullient movie-original \u2018I\u2019ve Got a Golden Ticket\u2019 \u2013 but ultimately there\u2019s too much empty sugar here and not enough flavour.\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory runs at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney until 19 May",

        "content": "Donald Trump has strongly denied the stunning claim that he was secretly working on behalf of Russia and again threatened to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall.\nIn 20-minute live phone interview with Fox News on Saturday night, he described as an \u201cinsult\u201d the New York Times story that alleged the FBI launched an investigation into whether the he was acting as a Russian asset, against his own country\u2019s interests.\nTrump said the story, which claimed the investigation opened after Trump fired the FBI director James Comey in May 2017, was \u201cthe most insulting article ever written\u201d.\n\u201cIf you read the article you\u2019ll see that they found absolutely nothing,\u201d he said during the Fox News interview.\n\u201cI think [the story] was a great insult and the New York Times is a disaster of a paper. It\u2019s a very horrible thing they said.\u201d\nCiting anonymous sources, the Times said the investigation was part counterintelligence, to determine whether Trump was knowingly or unknowingly working for Moscow and posed a threat to national security. It was also part criminal, to ascertain whether Trump\u2019s dismissal of Comey constituted obstruction of justice.\nThe FBI effort was soon absorbed into the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow, the Times reported, adding that it was unclear if the counterintelligence aspect is still being pursued.\nThe president again called Comey a \u201cliar\u201d and claimed the entire Russia investigation was a \u201cterrible hoax\u201d.\n\u201cEverybody knows it. It\u2019s really a shame because it takes time; it takes effort. Everybody knows there\u2019s no collusion,\u201d he said.\nTrump repeated baseless claims that the FBI mishandled an investigation into his election rival, Hillary Clinton. The president insisted that he had been far tougher on Russia than any other president, repeating claims he tweeted earlier on Saturday.\n\u201cI have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMaybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!\u201d\nTrump\u2019s warm relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long set alarm bells ringing. The day after firing Comey, he hosted Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in the Oval Office \u2013 and disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation. At a summit in Helsinki last summer, Trump appeared to side with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.\nOn Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump took the notes from of a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg from his own interpreter. Citing current and former US officials, the paper also said Trump instructed the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials.\nAsked why he would not release the conversations, Trump said: \u201cI would. I don\u2019t care ... I\u2019m not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d\nIn December the president startled his own national security officials by suddenly announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria, widely seen as handing a strategic victory to Russia and prompting the defense secretary James Mattis to quit. He also bizarrely endorsed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.\nThe House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, said in a statement he did not \u201ccomment on the specifics of the New York Times report\u201d but said \u201ccounterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the beginning\u201d.\nHis committee, he said, \u201chas a responsibility to the American people to ensure that the president is working in our national interest and is not motivated by any other factor\u201d.\nHoled up at the White House, Trump turned to the other subject dominating US politics: the partial government shutdown which, going into its 23rd day, is now the longest in history, eclipsing the record set under Bill Clinton.\nHe called on the Democrats to do a deal and again threatened to declare a national emergency if they don\u2019t \u201ccome to their senses\u201d.\n\u201cI have the absolute right to call a national emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cOther presidents have called national emergencies for lesser importance than this. I\u2019d rather see the Democrats come back from their vacation and act. It would take me 15 minutes to get a deal done and everyone could go back to work.\u201d\nTrump is demanding $5.7bn towards his long-promised wall on the US-Mexico border, claiming it will solve a humanitarian and national security crisis. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have passed measures to reopen the government without funding the wall, which they regard as an expensive, impractical and immoral response to a manufactured crisis. The result is a political stalemate that leaves a quarter of the government unfunded.\nAbout 800,000 workers missed pay cheques on Friday. The House and Senate voted to give federal workers back pay whenever the federal government reopens, then left Washington for the weekend.\nWith polls showing Trump getting most of the blame, the president is toying with the idea of declaring a national emergency, bypassing Congress and funding the wall from existing federal revenue. Republicans are divided on the move and it would be certain to face legal challenges.",

The Home Depot where he already worked several shifts a week agreed to employ him full-time while he and hundreds of thousands of federal employees are locked out of their day-jobs.\nAt $14 an hour, his retail paycheck will hardly match what he earns as an attorney adviser with the Environmental Protection Agency. But with four children under eight years old, Hautamaki says it\u2019s a necessary accommodation.\nBut still he worries the temporary income won\u2019t be enough to cover the costs of daycare, a mortgage and the rest of his family\u2019s monthly expenses if the shutdown lasts several more weeks as Donald Trump has threatened.\n\u201cImagine. I\u2019m 42 years old and my retired mother is calling to ask if I need a loan,\u201d Hautamaki said, speaking from his home in Silver Spring, Maryland, after finishing a shift that started at 4am. \u201cI told her: not yet.\u201d\nHe let out a sigh. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d\nThe Washington metropolitan area is home to the largest share of federal workers in the country \u2013 and on Friday many of them missed a paycheck for the first time since parts of the federal government ceased functioning on 22 December. Frustrated employees posted photos on Twitter of their pay stub showing a net pay of $0.\nMembers of Congress left town on Friday and no negotiations are scheduled.\n\u201cThis shutdown isn\u2019t funny anymore,\u201d Randy Erwin, the president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said at a rally in downtown Washington on Thursday. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s ruining people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nHundreds of furloughed federal workers, contractors and union members from the capital region marched to the White House last week carrying signs that directed Congress and the president to \u201cDo your job so we can do ours\u201d.\n\u201cThis is not a vacation,\u201d said Marcia Mia, a furloughed federal worker who helps encourage compliance with environmental laws at the EPA. She attended the rally with a co-worker, Apple Chapman, who both carried signs warning that polluters are are getting off while they are kept off the job.\n\u201cThe work that we do has a direct impact on communities,\u201d said Chapman, who has worked at the agency for 18 years. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to know that and not be allowed to go to work.\u201d\nThe nation\u2019s capital is now often eerily quiet during the weekday afternoon.\nLunchtime hotspots that typically draw long lines have none. Food trucks pack up earlier than usual. Taxi drivers circle the city in search of passengers. And few tourists wander the National Mall, where the Smithsonian museums have closed for the duration of the shutdown.\nMeanwhile, the city of Washington has hired extra workers to clean up garbage from hundreds of trash bins managed by the federal government. The DC council had to pass the \u201cLove Act\u201d allowing couples to obtain marriage licenses because the bureau that handles them is funded by the federal government.\nAs the impact of the shutdown ripples across the region, some DC businesses are offering discounts or assistance to ease the financial burden \u2013 and tedium \u2013 of a prolonged period without work.\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the owner of several popular restaurants in downtown DC and a vocal Trump critic, will give free sandwiches to \u201call my beautiful hardworking people of the Federal [government]\u201d.

Meanwhile, several DC-area utility companies, as well as banks, mortgage companies and credit unions, have taken stepsto help customers affected by the shutdown.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the uncertainty \u2013 is it going to end today or is it not going to end?\u201d said one 54-year-old employee of the National Science Foundation who asked not to be named. \u201cYou want to plan your life but without knowing day-to-day what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\nBefore the shutdown, he was charged with helping to prepare for it. He spent hours in meetings discussing funding lapse plans with senior officials who might otherwise be commissioning scientific research.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the public at large appreciates how much goes into preparing for a shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re costing everyone money \u2013 not saving money.\u201d",

        "content": "Seemingly immune to the ravages of time, Roger Federer says a bit of luck and understanding his body have kept him competitive\nRoger Federer, who is ageing with the irresistible longevity of an oak tree, is the very antithesis of Andy Murray. While the Scot\u2019s 31-year-old body screams at him every morning when he puts on his socks and shoes, and whose match against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open might round out his career, Federer, at 37, continues to float on his own cloud.\nHis younger contemporaries are suffering to the point of resignation in the struggle to stay in a sport that has become cruelly brutal, yet Federer appears to be what Alex Corretja described Murray as when coaching him at his physical peak between 2008 and 2011: \u201cindestructible.\u201d\nThe Swiss has had his aches and pains \u2013 even late-career knee surgery \u2013 but, as he sets about chasing a seventh Australian Open championship and the 100th title of a career that began last century, astonishingly he is among the fittest of the 128 contenders.\nThere has only ever been one player named Federer in tennis, just as there was only one Bradman in cricket. The Don was plagued by ill-health, though. Federer has been blessed in every way.\n\u201cHis body took the decision, unfortunately,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI remember when I played with him in Glasgow [in late 2017, as Murray contemplated a comeback], I couldn\u2019t believe he actually played. But it was for a good cause. It must have been a very long couple of years for him. I was disappointed and sad, a little bit shocked, to know now that we\u2019re going to lose him at some point. I hope that he can play a good Australian Open and can keep playing beyond that, finish the way he wants to at Wimbledon.\u201d\nThose are noble sentiments. The reality is Murray is near breaking point. Only more surgery could prolong his career. There is no defying the calendar.\nLargely immune to the ravages of time himself, the defending champion \u2013 who plays Denis Istomin on Monday evening - described on Sunday how players slowly crumble as the years pass.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say when you\u2019re young, you have, I don\u2019t know, a pain in the elbow. Next day you can play with it; two days later it\u2019s like you never had it. All of a sudden \u2013 at maybe 30, 35, 40, depending on who you are, what problems you\u2019ve had \u2013 you will feel it for two weeks. You can still play, but now you\u2019re playing with pain. It takes longer to get rid of.\n\u201cEverybody is very different. Everybody takes the pain differently. That\u2019s also where you have to be very wise [about] what kind of schedule you\u2019re playing with, what problem you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\nSo, how has the Methuselah of sport held the demons at bay for so long?\n\u201cIf you look at how unlucky things were with the incident here a few years ago when I ran the bath, I guess the knee was ready to go. Could easily have happened in the match against Novak [Djokovic], but it didn\u2019t, maybe because I was warmed up. I have no idea what happened. You also need a bit of luck.\n\u201cThen, I understand my body very well. I know when something hurts and I can play with it; I know when something hurts and I should not play with it, but I can still play maybe a match, maybe a week, a month, whatever. Sometimes that helps. But every player has that. My team know when to push me, when they are happy that I don\u2019t practise so much.\u201d\nThe core difference between Federer and his rivals is his unshakeable belief in his talent, to trust his genius.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed I can play tennis when I don\u2019t train so much,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been maybe one thing, the confidence I have in my game, even if I don\u2019t play so much, where I still feel I can come up to a good level. Maybe that takes away some pressure.\u201d\nHe added \u2013 confirming the silent thoughts of everyone in the room \u2013 that, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s also the way I play tennis, smoother than the other guys. It maybe looks that way [but] I work extremely hard in the matches as well. It just doesn\u2019t come across so much.\u201d\nNow he has to deliver again to launch another assault on history. In the last match of day one on Rod Laver Arena, where he has celebrated most of his 94 wins here in 107 matches stretching back to the turn of the millennium, he plays Istomin for the seventh time. The world No99 has taken just two sets off him, both in front of Federer\u2019s Swiss friends in Basel, in their last two meetings.\nTwo years ago, though, he put an ailing Novak Djokovic out in five sets in the first round, his only success against the Serb in six attempts.\nFederer says, \u201cI know what Denis did to Novak. I watched the entire game. I\u2019ve had some tough ones against him in the past. He can play well on fast courts, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be here as well. But I\u2019m playing good tennis. I\u2019m confident it needs a good performance by my opponent to beat me.\u201d",

The French education minister approved a proposal to push back by an hour the start of the school day to 9am for students aged 15-18 in Paris.\nIt followed the publication in December of a study of teenagers in Seattle which found a \u201csignificant improvement in the sleep duration of students\u201d after the start of the school day was delayed by almost an hour.\n\u201cThe Paris decision can only be a good thing for the children,\u201d said Dr Neil Stanley, author of How To Sleep Well, who has noted increasing sleep problems in children and teenagers. \u201cFor the benefit of our children start times should be moved later, bringing them more in line with teenagers\u2019 biological rhythms.\u201d\nMandy Gurney, founder of Millpond Children\u2019s Sleep Clinic, has seen a 30% rise in referrals of school-aged children in the last 12 months. Lisa Artis of the Sleep Council also said there had been a \u201cnoticeable rise\u201d in sleep deprivation among school children. \u201cA change in the school day would be beneficial to teenagers, but it would take a massive campaign for it to happen. The school day is designed to fit in with the standard working day.\u201d\nSchool leaders are increasingly raising concerns about overtired children, both in secondary schools and the upper end of primary schools, according to James Bowen, director of NAHT Edge, an offshoot of the head teachers\u2019 union.\nBut there was not enough \u201chard evidence\u201d to justify the \u201cdrastic step\u201d of changing school hours, he added. \u201cThe bottom line is that school leaders are very interested in any approach that may have a positive impact on pupils\u2019 learning, but there are significant logistical barriers to changing the school day\u201d especially for working families, he said.\nThe Education Endowment Foundation funds Teensleep, a research project by Oxford and Durham universities. Teensleep wanted to evaluate the impact of a later start to the school day, but not enough schools signed up for a trial. Now it is examining the consequences of \u201csleep education\u201d in schools, with the results due to be published in the spring.\nGuidance in providing sleep lessons for pupils aged seven to 16 was rolled out to teachers last month.\nScientists say that humans\u2019 circadian rhythms \u2013 the body clock that manages the cycle of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 change in adolescence. The cycle shifts two hours in teenagers which means that they are wired to go to sleep and wake up later. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re in a different time zone,\u201d said Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at the Evelina children\u2019s hospital in London.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking them to get up before their body clock is ready, because that\u2019s the way the adult world works. So most teenagers end up sleep-deprived.\u201d\nSleep is the \u201cstrongest predictor of wellbeing among teenagers\u201d, said Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at University College London and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\nHe co-authored a paper, published in the British Medical Journal in November, based on a study of more than 120,000 15-year-olds which pointed to increasing evidence of the dangers of inadequate sleep.\n\u201cWhen we think about all the things parents worry about, the effects of sleep are about four times higher than the effects of smartphone use,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is major development of the brain in puberty. We need to go back to basics: more focus on sleep, physical activity and diet.\u201d\nFarquhar said: \u201cIf we could rewire the world to suit teenagers, we\u2019d see benefits. But there are practical difficulties in doing that. So, as a start, schools could not schedule double maths at 8.30am and perhaps make PE the first lesson of the day.\u201d",

And the crown of its electric hybrid vehicles is the Outlander\nMitsubishi Outlander 2.0 PHEV GX4h 5dr Auto\n  Price \u00a336,755Top speed 106mph0-62mph 11 secondsMPG 166.1CO2 41g/km\nFor boy racers and speed queens who came of age in the 90s, Mitsubishi was synonymous with one thing: wheel-smoking acceleration of such abrupt intensity that it was like strapping your innards to a firework. The model in question was the Lancer Evolution, known to all as the Evo. It was a bland-looking saloon, but it packed a phenomenal turbo-charged engine beneath the shell of its innocuous bonnet. What I loved about it was its below-the-radar appeal. It had a coy \u201cWho me?\u201d innocence, which added to its subversion. You had to be in the know to appreciate its power. There were clues, of course: the huge rear wing, the gaping air intake and the infamous FQ variant \u2013 the \u201cFQ\u201d standing for \u201cFrigging Quick.\u201d\nMitsubishi has made a habit of springing the unexpected on us. I\u2019m not sure many would guess that the bestselling plug-in hybrid vehicle in Europe and the best-selling plug-in (hybrid or full-electric) for the past three years in Britain is a Mitsubishi. Not a Nissan, not a Toyota, not a Renault, but a rather ordinary looking SUV called an Outlander PHEV (which stands for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle). It doesn\u2019t look futuristic. It does a very good job at being virtually anonymous. But the PHEV performs an astonishing conjuring trick. It can be driven by its naturally aspirated 2.4-litre petrol engine, or by its electric motors powered by batteries alone, or by a combination of the two. Its batteries can be charged on the move or the car can be plugged into the mains. It can cruise on electric power alone at up to 84mph \u2013 however, the range on pure electric is only 28 miles. That option has been designed for users who do short, daily, urban journeys. If your office commute is around 25 miles, you could in theory drive to work, recharge and drive home, without burning a single drop of petrol.\nFor longer journeys, you\u2019ll need to use a combination. You don\u2019t need to make these judgements yourself: the onboard computer is more than happy to choose which mode is most appropriate without being asked.\nThe car is an SUV, which is a super useful body style: it\u2019s one we Britons can\u2019t get enough of. There isn\u2019t a carmaker today who isn\u2019t rushing to get an SUV on to its books. The fact that you can now have a roomy five-seater with a spacious boot that is also kinder to our planet means you will have so much reason to feel smug, you might even get sick of yourself.\nThe new Outlander looks pretty much the same as the old one \u2013 students of car design will spot the revised LED headlights. But this isn\u2019t a car that has ever traded on its looks: customers like it as it is. Inside it\u2019s comfortable and well laid out. It makes a virtue of practicality. To drive, it\u2019s almost unsettlingly smooth. It couldn\u2019t be more different to the smoke and fire of Mitsubishi\u2019s Evo. If the Evo was a young person\u2019s car, the Outlander is definitely one for the mature motorist \u2013 and as I drifted peacefully along the M4 en route to visit the grandparents for Sunday lunch, I couldn\u2019t have felt happier driving one.\nEmail Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166",

        "content": "Senate hearings set for William Barr, author of controversial memo some say suggests he will undermine Robert Mueller\nTwo months after Donald Trump fired his original attorney general, the Senate will on Tuesday cross-examine his proposed replacement, William Barr, a Washington stalwart who served in the role under George HW Bush.\nThe pick has been welcomed by Republicans and even some Trump detractors, who reason that Barr is a known quantity and that Trump might have done much worse, given his extraordinary views on presidential impunity and his expressed hostility toward the Department of Justice (DoJ).\nBut some Democrats, former federal prosecutors and DoJ figures are warning that Barr might not be such a known quantity after all, and that confirming him as attorney general would threaten the work of the special counsel Robert Mueller and the justice department more broadly.\nBarr\u2019s nomination has surfaced at an unusually fraught moment in Washington. While clashes between the White House and justice department are not unheard of, Trump\u2019s war on the former attorney general Jeff Sessions, his attacks on top justice department figures such as the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and former FBI director, James Comey, and his stated belief that he should be able to direct justice department investigations \u2013 all combined with the sheer magnitude of alleged criminal conduct by former Trump aides and business associates and possibly Trump himself \u2013 means the next attorney general will wield power with likely historic consequences.\nThe announcement last week of the planned departure of Rosenstein, who is seen as having faithfully protected the Mueller investigation against serious pressure from the White House, ratcheted stakes even higher.\nCritics of Barr have raised an alarm about a memo that Barr submitted to the department last year, ostensibly unsolicited, arguing that Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump for alleged obstruction of justice was \u201cfatally misconceived\u201d.\n\u201cThe new Barr memo makes it clear that his view is outside the mainstream even of conservative, basic unitary executive theory,\u201d said Neil Kinkopf, a Georgia State law professor who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Clinton administration. \u201cIt goes beyond that, to the point where it comes very close to putting the president above the law.\u201d\nSenator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Democrat on the judiciary committee, which will question Barr and vote on his nomination, said: \u201cThe memorandum is deeply worrisome because in effect he says the president is above the law.\n\u201cThat\u2019s incorrect as a matter of law, but certainly for an attorney general to have that position is deeply wrong.\u201d\nOther critics have raised concerns that Barr, who as attorney general in the early 1990s recommended that Bush pardon six Reagan officials caught up in the Iran-Contra affair, was nominated to defend the White House, not just to run the justice department.\nThese critics point to Barr\u2019s recent record as a Trump apologist. After the firing of Comey in 2017, Barr published an op-ed in the Washington Post praising the move. He also has supported Trump\u2019s call for a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to a uranium mining company that benefited from a decision made while she was secretary of state, a marginal view mainly consigned to the fever swamps of the far right.\nBarr, 68, grew up in New York City and graduated from George Washington University law school before taking up a post on Ronald Reagan\u2019s domestic policy staff. At the justice department he served in the Office of Legal Counsel, as deputy attorney general and finally, from 1991 to 1993, as attorney general, spotlighting gang violence and prison conditions \u2013 Barr argued that judges were dictating unrealistic quality-of-life standards.\nBarr \u2013 who is in his spare time an expert bagpiper \u2013 was also an immigration hardliner, hiring hundreds of new border guards and, according to a 1992 CBS News report that called him \u201ca tough guy who\u2019s not afraid to ruffle feathers\u201d, swearing in some of them himself \u201cto underscore he meant business\u201d.\nA 1991 Los Angeles Times report noted Barr\u2019s \u201cdry, self-deprecating wit and full-bodied laugh\u201d but called him \u201ca staunch conservative who rarely hesitates to put his hardline views into action\u201d, citing a 1989 legal opinion in which Barr authorized federal agents to seize fugitives overseas without a foreign government\u2019s permission.\nHowever, even some strong Trump critics believe that, based on his past career, Barr would reprise his leadership of the justice department in good faith and not with undue deference to the White House.\n\u201cCount me as one Democrat who thinks President Trump has made an excellent choice in his decision to nominate William P Barr,\u201d Harry Litman, a former prosecutor who worked under Barr, wrote in December.\n\u201cWas he, and is he, very conservative? You bet \u2026 But the roots of his political views concern the rule of law, public safety and the fair application of legal rules to all.\u201d\nBut others believe that Barr\u2019s memo criticizing Mueller is an indication that his judgment or perspective might have changed in the 25 years since he was known for steering the justice department with a fair hand.\n\u201cThat reputation would make him all the more effective an attack dog for Trump,\u201d said Kinkopf, who has argued elsewhere that Barr\u2019s \u201cexpansive view of presidential power\u201d laid the legal groundwork for the George W Bush-era torture program.\n\u201cIf he has gone over the to the dark side, so to speak, his past credible service makes him all the more effective in undermining the rule of law, and all the more dangerous.\u201d",

        "content": "The city\u2019s hospitality industry worries about losing its winter boost as self-driving technology prompts shift to outdoor event\nThe icy winds whistling off the Great Lakes will take temperatures to well below freezing in Detroit this week. Not that the cold will deter hundreds of thousands of visitors from pouring into Motor City for the North American International Auto Show, arguably the world\u2019s most famous car show, when it opens on Monday.\nThis will be the last year that warmly wrapped gear heads will face an icy dash between the show and the city\u2019s sold-out hotels and restaurants to discuss this year\u2019s models and parties. Next year NAIAS \u2013 which can trace its history back to 1899 \u2013 moves to the balmy month of June. The plan is to show the resurgent city at its best and allow manufacturers to demonstrate their new cars \u2013 and technology \u2013 outside in the fresh air.\nIt may seem like an obvious move but some fear the shift could kill an event that pumped $480m into the region last year, filling hotels and restaurants with car fans, corporate accounts and journalists in the post-holiday lull and giving the still-troubled city a much-needed boost. This year that boost comes as Detroit\u2019s largest industry appears to be heading for trouble again.\nLocals are worried. \u201cWe\u2019ll survive but I guarantee you others won\u2019t,\u201d said Timothy Tharp, board chair of the Detroit Restaurant Association and co-owner of several downtown restaurants including the historic Grand Trunk Pub, a lively spot housed in the former ticket office of the Grand Trunk Railway.\nJune is already a big month for downtown Detroit, he said. \u201cJanuarys are traditionally a very slow month for restaurants but thanks to the show they have been great for us,\u201d he said. Until now.\nGrand Trunk is a five-minute walk from the giant Cobo Center convention hall where NAIAS takes place. \u201cWe have so many international visitors, people speaking Japanese, German, French,\u201d said Tharp. \u201cAre they going to come in summer?\u201d He\u2019s not convinced. The impact on staff, who are likely to have hours cut \u201cwill be enormous,\u201d he said.\nBut car shows, and not just Detroit\u2019s, have issues. The industry has changed \u2013 unveiling new technology is now just \u2013 if not more \u2013 important than launching new models. Over in always sunny Las Vegas the Consumer Electronics Show, which overlaps with NAIAS, has stolen many of the headlines in car news in recent years. Even hometown giants Ford and General Motors have used CES to show off their tech chops.\nErik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said his family used to make an annual trip to the Detroit show when he was a child. \u201cIt was exciting. There were exotic cars you would never see otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ll go but not with any great excitement. I asked my neighbors recently if they\u2019d go and they kinda shrugged.\u201d\nGordon said Detroit would probably remain the epicenter of US car manufacturing but the buzz had moved on. Moving the show was unlikely to change that.\nAnd after bouncing back from near-collapse automakers are also re-evaluating how much money they spend at auto shows. Major European carmakers including Audi, Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Mini have all dropped out of Detroit this year, making the International \u201cI\u201d in NAIAS superfluous.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the car companies are cutting back. Some $127bn (\u00a3100bn) was wiped off the value of car companies last year. Sales held up in the US but few are expecting that trend to hold in 2019 or 2020.\nLast November GM announced it was shedding 14,700 jobs and closing plants as it deals with slowing sales of sedans. Interest rates are rising in the US and new car sales are expected to decline. The price of a new car hit a record $35,957 in December, about 2% higher than the previous year. according to Edmunds.com.\nAnd then there is Donald Trump. His ongoing trade wars, with China in particular, have rattled auto executives and their shareholders and steel tariffs have increased manufacturers\u2019 costs. They have also contributed to a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s largest car market. Chinese car sales just experienced their first slowdown in more than 20 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty quiet show this year,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Auto Trader. \u201cEverybody is pulling in the reins on spending.\u201d\nOne quiet year doesn\u2019t spell doom. Car sales are cyclical and Detroit has faced down bigger worries. But shifting the car show is still a big gamble.\nLast year it attracted more than 800,000 visitors and the money it pumped into the local economy is equivalent to holding two Super Bowls. But the risk of not moving the show outweighs the risk of leaving it alone, said Sandy Baruah, chief executive officer of the Detroit Regional Chamber.\nBaruah, a car fan who has been attending the show for over a decade, said the show had to change or die.\u201d\nCar shows used to be about \u201cshowing off sheet metal\u201d, he said. \u201cThe new design, the new interiors. Now it\u2019s not just about those things it\u2019s about the technology in your vehicle and what it\u2019s going to do for you.\u201d\nThe classic car show display with a car on a pedestal revolving slowly under bright lights accompanied by a statuesque model (usually female and underdressed for a Detroit winter) just doesn\u2019t cut it these days.\nInstead he expects to see a lot more hands-on demonstrations of all the new self-driving tech that the car companies are developing. It is certainly something the industry needs.\nPublic polling shows most drivers don\u2019t currently trust autonomous cars. According to a survey conducted by the insurer AAA, 73% of American drivers report they would be too afraid to ride in a fully self-driving vehicle. That\u2019s a problem for an industry currently spending billions on robot vehicles.\n\u201cThat number changes 180 degrees when you put people in a vehicle to experience it,\u201d said Baruah.\nAn outdoor car show will allow Detroit to demonstrate the future of driving in a way that the cold-bound indoor event never could, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to educate people,\u201d he said.\nThe move will be a body blow to Detroit\u2019s burgeoning bar and restaurant scene. Not so long ago car execs would drive miles out of town to take visitors for dinner after the show passing miles of burned-out houses and blacked-out streets. Now once scary streets are filled with bars and restaurants selling local beers, craft cocktails and posh pizza.\nBut as the car industry knows, you can\u2019t stand still, said Baruah. \u201cThe greater risk is not moving to the summer. Any change has inherent risk but sometimes making no change is the greatest risk of all.\u201d",

        "content": "The bricks-and-mortar chain is the latest high-profile victim of the shift to online shopping but some wounds are self-inflicted\nThere can be few bleaker testaments to the beleaguered condition of US retail than the Sears department store in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Once a flagship of the world\u2019s largest retailer, the landmarked art deco building was opened in 1932 by Eleanor Roosevelt, who made the first purchase ever in this location, \u201ca pair of baby booties\u201d, according to the Brooklyn Eagle. There\u2019s little of that historic legacy on display today.\nThere is just one entrance open at the store now. The walls are a dirty beige and much of the merchandise sub-discount. Yet many of the shoppers said they were pleased to come and browse. Unlike hundreds of shuttered stores across the country, it is at least still in business.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been here for so long. It\u2019s like a staple of the neighborhood,\u201d said Waverly Atkins, who\u2019d come to buy a new filter for her refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019d miss it if it were gone.\u201d\nLast week, Sears narrowly avoided a deadline for liquidation after a New York bankruptcy judge permitted Eddie Lampert, whose hedge fund ranks as Sears\u2019 biggest shareholder and creditor, more time to improve his offer for the company\u2019s assets, another step in his decade-long, seemingly quixotic, effort to keep the ailing retailer afloat.\nOn Monday the company\u2019s fate will be decided at an auction when Lampert\u2019s now $5bn bid will go up against liquidators who are planning to shut the retailer down.\nSears has been teetering on the edge of collapse since October when Lampert, who holds around $2.5bn of the $5.5bn debt load, placed the 133-year-old company in bankruptcy protection.\nA company representative said the new offer \u2013 which includes an additional $600m to cover severance costs and suppliers\u2019 bills - provided \u201csubstantially more value to stakeholders than would be the case in liquidation and is the only option to save an iconic American retailer and up to 50,000 jobs\u201d.\n\u201cWe believe in Sears and will continue to do everything we can to ensure that it has a profitable future.\u201d\nFew others do. Representatives for Sears did not immediately accept the new offer, leaving shoppers like Atkins wondering whether the warranty would be honored if they bought a Sears-branded appliance. Bad publicity, others said, did not help foster confidence in Sears.\nIf creditors reject Lampert\u2019s offer, the only bidders left plan to shut Sears and Kmart, the discount firm Lampert merged Sears with in an $11bn deal in 2006, and sell off its assets, primarily its real estate.\nThat would come as a blow to Sears\u2019 longtime customers but in the age of Amazon, as US bricks-and-mortar chains struggle to compete, it will come as little surprise against a backdrop of what has been called \u201cAmerica\u2019s retail apocalypse\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky situation,\u201d noted one Sears customer, who asked to be referred to as Miss Bennett, as she perused a women\u2019s footwear aisle. To survive, she said, \u201cthey\u2019d have to come with something new. What that is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe grave condition of US retailers was underscored again last week when, despite a booming economy and record consumer confidence, major US retailers recorded disappointing results from the holiday period.\nSome of the biggest US retailers, including Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s and Target, saw $34bn wiped from their market value. Shares in Macy\u2019s dropped 17.7%, their biggest one-day sell-off on record, after the department store cut its sales and earnings guidances having recently upgraded them.\nThe pessimism on Wall Street spread quickly from department stores to virtually all retail sectors as investors discounted retail\u2019s ability to grasp the changes coming as consumers shift to online shopping.\nBut while online shopping has hurt Sears, its problems are in some ways exceptional. Through the 60s,70s and 80s, customers went to Sears for appliances and workwear but they lost touch with that customer, says Hitha Herzog, retail analyst at H Squared Research, who describes Sears\u2019s problems as \u201ca near-perfect storm as to what can go wrong with a retailer\u201d.\n\u201cThere was mismanagement on Lampert\u2019s part getting the correct product mix into the stores, then they couldn\u2019t figure out who their customer base was and didn\u2019t cater to that base, and they had flagship stores in malls that are losing foot-traffic like crazy.\u201d\nThe collapse of many of America\u2019s chain stores is not as simple as blaming Amazon.\n\u201cIn general, people don\u2019t want to go to these massive department stores any more,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cWhen they want specific products, they go directly to the brand or to the manufacturer.\u201d\nOne common factor for these troubled chains is that they are overloaded with debt \u2013 often from leveraged buyouts led by private equity firms. Sustaining that debt in an economy that may well be heading for recession can only become harder.\nIn September, Toys R Us surprised investors by filing for bankruptcy \u2013 the third-largest retail bankruptcy in US history \u2013 after struggling to refinance just $400m of its $5bn in debt.\nAccording to Fitch, the amount of retail debt set to mature rose from $100m in 2017 to $1.9bn in 2018. From 2019 to 2025, it will balloon to a yearly average of almost $5bn.\nAnd the demand for refinancing in the retail sector comes just as credit markets tighten. Part of the reason Sears filed for bankruptcy in October was that Lampert found he could no longer raise capital.\nAs Sears employees and creditors wait for the outcome, the US faces another problem: what to do with the real estate vacated by chains.\nEven before the e-commerce boom, US retail was considered massively overbuilt \u2013 a result of the big-box era that saw huge stores built across the country in almost every category of retailing. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, 6,752 locations were scheduled to close through the first nine months of 2017. Of those, 550 were department stores, equating to 43m sq feet of retail space, or about half the total. This year\u2019s figures may well be higher.\nTens of thousands of low-paid jobs will go with those closures. States like Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan and Illinois have been among the hardest hit. But others which have relied on retail job growth, including Nevada, Florida and Arkansas, may now feel the impact.\nThat leaves mall owners struggling to find opportunities to bring foot traffic back to their locations. But even they don\u2019t want department stores as their flagship tenants.\nIn court papers, mall owners Simon Property Group and Brixmor Property Group said Sears\u2019 plan to keep stores open rather than pursue going-out-of-business sales was \u201can unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people\u2019s money\u201d.\nAccording to Herzog, mall owners are open to offers. \u201cThose big-box stores are probably going to turn into entertainment centres, maybe service centres, gyms or hospitals. Maybe there could be a real estate play on housing. A go-cart track. Anything is possible, but we know for a fact it probably won\u2019t be a retailer in.\u201d",

This is the home of that most sensuous of red grapes, pinot noir, which makes glorious wines, the best of which are, alas, also among the world\u2019s rarest and most expensive. Fortunately, winemakers all over the world are managing to capture some of the silky charm of Burgundy at more humane prices. Germany, for example, which has quietly become one of the most impressive pinot centres, does a nice line in affordable styles alongside its more ambitiously priced bottles, with Hans Baer\u2019s super-bright red-berries an absolutely delightful way to spend \u00a36.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nEdoardo Miroglio Soli Pinot Noir, Thracian Valley, Bulgaria 2016 (\u00a311.95, The Wine Society; Vinoteca) While few German pinots can match Hans Baer\u2019s take on what the Germans sometimes call sp\u00e4tburgunder, there\u2019s a high pleasure-per-pound ratio in the Hofmann Sp\u00e4tburgunder Rotwein Trocken, Rheinhessen 2015 (\u00a312.50, Slurp) and the burst of cherry juiciness in Villa Wolf Pinot Noir, Pfalz 2016 (\u00a312.50). Further east, Romania has a long if not always glorious tradition of making budget pinot, with the reliable firm Cremale Recas the name behind numerous examples, such as the gently spicy Incanta Pinot Noir 2017 (\u00a37.99, or \u00a35.99 as part of a mixed case of six, Majestic). And Italian winemaker Edoardo Miroglio has shown an undiscovered affinity for pinot in Bulgaria: vintage after vintage, his lithe Soli Pinot Noir is among the best value reds of any kind.\nErrazuriz Coastal Series Pinot Noir, Aconcagua Costa, Chile 2016 (\u00a310.99, Waitrose) From New Zealand\u2019s Central Otago to Australia\u2019s Yarra Valley and California\u2019s Santa Barbara, the New World\u2019s finest pinots are often a match for top Burgundy in price as well as quality. But you can still get a measure of pinot\u2019s graceful allure in a decent Antipodean pair from Asda: both the Extra Special Yarra Valley Pinot Noir (\u00a38) and the rounder slightly richer Extra Special New Zealand Pinot Noir (\u00a38.98) have the requisite mix of slippery texture and earthy notes to rub along well with mushrooms or fish. Another southern hemisphere country that has shown a real improvement in its pinot, without pushing prices too high, is Chile. Coastal sites seem to provide the best environment for a variety that likes a cooler climate, with Errazuriz\u2019s Pacific-cooled vineyards yielding a delightful, floral style.\nFollow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach",

        "content": "Fearing the prospect of a plunging pound, travellers are turning to an unlikely destination to make their money go further\nAs the wrangling over how Britain should leave the EU reaches fever pitch, one country is already experiencing a Brexit dividend: Bulgaria.\nResorts in the south-eastern European country have seen a surge in bookings from British holidaymakers as families seek out alternative summer destinations.\nTraditionally popular tourist spots in the eurozone have become pricier as the pound has slumped against the euro since the vote to leave the EU in 2016. Now families are taking action to guard against future fluctuations in the event of no deal.\nDuring the busiest holiday booking period of the year, travel agents report that more people are opting for all-inclusive deals, in effect locking in costs for food, drink and accommodation.\nBanks currently give about \u20ac1.11 to the pound, a sharp drop from just before the referendum, when \u00a31 bought \u20ac1.30. In December, travellers at some UK airports were receiving only \u20ac0.90 for every \u00a31 they changed as Brexit turmoil pushed sterling to fresh lows. Expectations are that a no-deal will result in a further drop in the value of sterling, making this summer even more expensive for anyone travelling to Europe.\nBut Bulgaria, a low-cost destination for both sun and skiing holidays, has seen the benefit of the currency uncertainty. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said there had been an increase of almost one third in the number of holiday bookings to the country this year compared with 2018, when there had already been a rise on the previous year.\n\u201cPeople are looking at different destinations and the length of time that they go in order to make sure that they can get the best value for money when they are being increasingly cost-conscious,\u201d said Abta.\nDire warnings have been made about what would happen to sterling on the currency markets under a no-deal. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said last summer that it was likely there would be a drop in value, while the Bank of England said in November that a disorderly exit from the EU could result in a fall of 25% \u2013 lowering the pound to below parity with the dollar.\nLast weekend was one of the busiest periods of the year for travel agents as people sought to offset the January blues by booking a summer holiday. Travel agents reported strong sales despite the Brexit uncertainty, with travel firm Tui saying summer 2019 was ahead of last year.\nBut if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal the outlook could change.\nFor example, the consumer group Which? has warned that, even if people have bought and paid for their holiday already, they are not fully protected from price increases that may come into effect in the case of a no-deal. Holiday companies have the right to raise the price of a holiday by up to 8% if they incur additional costs as a result of new taxes and fees imposed by third parties, it said.\nBeyond the currency fluctuations, a no-deal could result in a series of administrative headaches for travellers. Abta has warned that UK-issued European health insurance cards, which allow EU citizens access to state healthcare in other EU countries, would no longer be valid. Drivers may need to apply for an international driving permit and also carry a physical card issued by their insurance company to show their cover is applicable while abroad.\nThere would also probably be changes to the documents and health checks required for pets. Rules around roaming for mobile phones would probably change, although some companies have said they will continue to offer the same prices after a no-deal.\nInsecurity around the future of Brexit has also affected the housing market, with sellers and buyers sitting tight because of the uncertainty over the future. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last month reported that the market was at its weakest level in more than six years.\nDavid Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London & Country said the uncertainty had contributed to the slow market and that it was unlikely to change now that the new year was here, as people adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.",

But it wasn\u2019t exactly what he had in mind when he left his homeland to study photography in Paris. \u201cIn the 00s, if you were a wedding photographer, you would not reveal it,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWhen I got back to India, people were a bit shocked, saying, \u2018You spent all that money, you should do advertising or something.\u2019 But weddings gave me excellent access to society across India. And I was one of the first photographers to use a, let\u2019s say, western approach to photojournalism and apply it to weddings.\u201d\nShantaram\u2019s new book, Matrimania, is \u201can alternative wedding album\u201d, one that features not only the bride and groom, but also guests and workers. Some of the \u201cmania\u201d in the title is obvious, such as an Alice in Wonderland-themed set on which the bride\u2019s parents spent \u00a350,000 on lighting. A typical wedding that Shantaram photographs might have 1,000 guests, but some have as many as 400,000. \u201cYou did hear that right!\u201d he says.\nBut many of his images deftly cut through the glamour, a technique familiar to admirers of Martin Parr or Lauren Greenfield. The photograph here is of a young bride at her family home in Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya state in north-east India. She appears euphoric, but her wedding has not been straightforward. First, hers is a \u201clove\u201d marriage \u2013 \u201cto differentiate it from an arranged marriage\u201d, says Shantaram, which is still \u201crare\u201d, he notes. Second, the bride and groom are from different castes and her new husband\u2019s entire family has boycotted the ceremony in protest.\n\u201cI really like the picture,\u201d says Shantaram, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a happy occasion, but there\u2019s also something sad, a little disturbing about it.\u201d\nMatrimania is out now (Hatje Cantz, \u00a345)",

The worst were the people who had money: the more money it seemed that somebody had, the cheaper they were.\u201d One particular man hired the limousine for the afternoon to propose to his girlfriend: Shorr bought flowers and drinks for the couple, and it took military precision, timing and coordination to get them from their upmarket brownstone building to Times Square for the exact moment a sign would appear on the billboard with her name on it, asking her to marry him. It all went off without a hitch: they got there at the right time, saw the message, she said yes. But at the end of the trip, nothing. The next day the man complained, saying the limousine was too cold.\nEven more galling, because of all the strategising involved, she didn\u2019t even get a picture of them. In 1989, as a recent graduate of New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, Shorr had decided to take a job as a limousine driver in her native Brooklyn to photograph the people she drove around. At first she had considered driving taxis, but the customers would have been in and out too quickly, constantly in a hurry, while driving a limo gave her several hours with her passengers. So, for nine months in 1989 and 1990, she worked weekends for a downtown limo company. \u201cI would describe them as being on the low end of the limousine hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cDrivers had to provide liquor and mixers for their clients, and everything was a bit shabby and cheap.\u201d\nShorr would wait until half an hour or so into the ride \u2013 assignments could last from a couple of hours to the whole day \u2013 and ask if she could take a few pictures. To her surprise, with the exception of one client, everyone said yes. When she revealed herself as a photographer, the dynamic inside the car would change. At first, they would treat her like an employee, giving her orders. \u201cBut then when I made that proclamation that I was a photographer doing a project, suddenly the guests in the car were working for me: everybody was like \u2018Oh Kathy\u2019, very friendly, and we were on the same level. You\u2019d feel like you were no longer somebody that was going to be told what to do, you were going to be asked.\u201d\nMost journeys were festive, joyous occasions: apart from one funeral, Shorr worked on weddings, proms, sweet-16 parties. \u201cPeople were in a good mood and when you\u2019re in that kind of mood there are very few things that will fluster you. There was a lot of laughing and drinking and extending the festivities of the day into the car.\u201d At the time, limousines were not an unusual way of getting to and from special events: for a couple of hundred dollars, anyone could feel like a celebrity for a few hours. \u201cIf you were a working-class person you knew that if you saved, you could afford a limousine if you had an event.\u201d\nStill, there was something about the limousine that fascinated onlookers. \u201cSeeing that big white car, it was always like: \u2018Oh, who\u2019s in the car? I hope it stops, I want to see them get out\u2019,\u201d says Shorr, remembering the crowds that would form. \u201cIt had a cachet to it \u2013 usually when there\u2019s a group of people that are dressed up, anybody in the vicinity is going to stop and watch, because it is kind of a spectacle.\u201d\nThere were also less thrilling sides to the job. Events could last five or six hours, which meant a lot of alone time for the waiting driver. Once, with her guests deposited at a party, Shorr parked the limousine and went to the cinema on her own; at other times she watched the TV in the back of the car. On another occasion, a young couple vaguely asked her to drive through Central Park. \u201cSo I drove through the park and I remember I had The Magic Flute on and I had the sun roof open and it was a nice night and all of a sudden the car started rocking back and forth.\u201d She laughs. \u201cSo I had an inkling what was going on in the back seat.\u201d\nAlmost 30 years on, Shorr \u2013 now a freelance photographer and teacher of documentary photography at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts \u2013 looks back on her limo-driving days fondly. Limousines have become less fashionable, partly due to increased transport options such as Uber, partly due to the changing nature of fame. \u201cMost celebrities drive in black 4x4 cars now,\u201d says Shorr. \u201cThat says \u2018Stay away, I don\u2019t want to be looked at\u2019, where with the limousine it was very much about \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m having a good time.\u2019 I can\u2019t even remember the last time I saw a limousine in New York.\u201d\nThe photos are a document of their time: people were smoking, smartphones didn\u2019t exist, no one was taking selfies. \u201cNobody was interested in giving you a sanitised version of what they were,\u201d says Shorr. \u201cThis was a collaboration between photographer and subject.\u201d Most of all, the photos are documents of people: the types of people Shorr grew up with, who lived in Brooklyn before it was an aspirational place to live. \u201cI think all the people I drove had jobs that they worked hard at. They weren\u2019t jobs that required an education per se, but these were people that did what they had to do, and they also played hard. They liked to enjoy themselves, they lived life. They knew how to have a good time.\u201d\nkathyshorr.com",

The water is icy, the breeze hard and the clouds low, yet she\u2019s imprinted by the experience as surely as one of Konrad Lorenz\u2019s geese. Or should that be gannets? Because she is left ravenous for more, seeking out its salty swell at every opportunity and lining her pockets with littoral keepsakes: sea glass, cockleshells, desiccated starfish.\nHer longing only intensifies when, living in Edinburgh and becalmed in a state of extended childhood while her contemporaries net dream jobs or \u2013 cliche of cliches \u2013 go travelling, she finds herself pregnant, aged 28. Her first thoughts are of all that seems suddenly out of reach. \u201cI wanted to have an adventure. But I\u2019m going to have a baby,\u201d she panics. If she has become a \u201cvessel\u201d, then the coming nine months will turn out to be a voyage in themselves, one whose far-flung itinerary includes ancient Greece and 18th-century shell grottoes and whose manifest runs to monsters of the deep, superstitious sea shanties and Grace Darling \u2013 the real Grace Darling, not the saccharine heroine invented by the Victorian media.\nAs she nurtures new life in her saline core, Runcie is also haunted by her grandmother\u2019s sudden death. Salt on Your Tongue is her voyage\u2019s log, a delightfully idiosyncratic prose debut that mixes memoir with history and cultural criticism to explore some of the ways in which the sea inspires and connects women in art and life.\nDespite her love of all things nautical, Runcie neither swims obsessively nor learns to sail. In the way of generations of women past, her relationship with the water is primarily shore-based. Ships may be universally female, their prows even adorned by bosomy figureheads, but in many traditions, it\u2019s considered bad luck to have an actual woman aboard. Female sailors have only grown common since the mid-20th century. Previously, \u201cwomen of the sea were, instead, women of the shore\u201d, Runcie notes. They were fishwives and sea widows. Or else they were fictitious and fearsome \u2013 mermaids, Scylla, Grendel\u2019s mother, beings whose malevolent intent underscored their otherness.\nBoth the superstitions and the tall tales derive, Runcie suggests, from women\u2019s \u201csuspicious affinity\u201d with the sea and its lunar tides. \u201cWomen and coasts are constantly changing and physically redrawing themselves in cycles,\u201d she reminds us, none more so than during pregnancy. And so she weathers waves of morning sickness and contractions, feeds salty cravings (anything from McDonald\u2019s fries to Monster Munch will do) and becomes a \u201csea witch\u201d during labour. Having wondered at the similarities between mythic sea monsters and drawings of early-stage foetuses, she is mesmerised by her newborn daughter\u2019s hands, delicate as starfish. Only wave sounds will lull her infant to sleep and, on their first beach trip together, Runcie dabs her forehead with seawater.\nA hybrid of nature journal and motherhood memoir sounds cynically on-trend, but Salt never feels anything less than wholly authentic. True, its brief chapters sometimes read like the ramblings of a writer in search of her story, hopping from topic to topic with a fidgetiness that can leave the reader feeling almost seasick. Still, relax into its motion and the narrative\u2019s fluidity becomes a joy. Runcie is appealingly unfashionable, too \u2013 she is erudite, weaving in quotes in ancient Greek and old English and, despite her narrative\u2019s first-person candour, she retains a certain reserve. (A passing reference to her clergyman grandfather, for example, neglects to mention that he was in fact the late Robert Runcie, archbishop of Canterbury.)\nThroughout, her prose is defined by cool confidence and unshowy clarity, allowing its more poetic observations, of which there are plenty, to glimmer like glass pebbles. Starfish are \u201cskeletons of the night, souvenirs of possibility\u201d, while at the height of summer, churches and pubs bask in a \u201cwarm haze as if seen through a jar of clear honey\u201d. She has a nice way with lists, too \u2013 her grandmother, for instance, \u201cwas a woman of piano keys and seashells, and distant sparkling cruise ships, and ambition and defiance\u201d. It all makes for bracing reading and, just like her favourite kind of blustery beach, it\u2019s strewn with pocketable treasures.\nBefore becoming pregnant, Runcie always suspected that her sea obsession was born of her Britishness \u2013 we are, she notes, a nation characterised by sea-themed cliches, from fish and chips to Rule Britannia. The pull towards the sea also seemed part of her search for an ancient, mystical connection to nature. By the book\u2019s end, she knows better. \u201cThe call of the sea is the call to the absolute strength of women,\u201d she declares.\n Salt on Your Tongue: Women and the Sea by Charlotte Runcie is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99).

        "content": "From yoga to surfing to pool therapy, Yorkshire to Sardinia to Poland, find yourself on an amazing retreat\nEva Wiseman visits a traditional \u2018wellness island\u2019 reinvented for the 21st-century traveller\nWhat is a holiday for? Once, I would have confidently said: \u201cFor a break from work\u201d, or if I was being paid by the word, \u201cFor reading bestsellers, in the sun, slightly drunk on local wine and weather, in a bikini and area of patchy phone reception, just bad enough that you have no choice but to fall behind on world news.\u201d\nBut it has become clear that the point of a holiday is a fluid and changeable thing, a thing that tells us much about our seasonal anxieties and spiritual ambitions. Consider for instance the inner workings of the period when a holiday was about \u201ctravel\u201d, about journeying and exploring, broadening our minds through a long plane ride to somewhere hot. Or the focus on \u201ceco-tourism\u201d, where tourists were encouraged to believe they were saving the world by camping.\nToday, according to Lonely Planet, \u201cwellness tourism\u201d is the fastest-growing sector in travel, having seen a 10% rise last year to make it a market worth over $500bn. The Global Wellness Institute predicts that by 2020 it will rise to $800bn. Across the globe, retreats and resorts are opening or rebranding, whether it\u2019s yurts in Cornwall or medical clinics in Greece, places to improve oneself, ideally while also getting a tan. And all because a holiday is never just a holiday.\nIt is for this reason that I\u2019m sweating on a six-seater plane with my family, juddering over the Adriatic and pretending to our four-year-old that everything is completely, totally fine. Until now, the island of Lo\u0161inj in Croatia has been accessible to many only via a five-hour road and ferry trip from Zagreb, so it\u2019s remained a holiday destination for tourists driving from Hungary or Germany. But this year the scattered five-star hotels have started chartering these tiny, terrifying flights to bring a wealthier clientele from Russia and the UK, people attracted by its historic \u201cwellness\u201d credentials.\nIn the late 1800s, after Croatian botanist Ambroz Hara\u010di\u0107 helped reforest this previously rocky port, the Austro-Hungarian government declared Lo\u0161inj a health resort. Today, having dusted off the title \u201cwellness island\u201d, Lo\u0161inj is welcoming a new influx of tourists visiting to enjoy air quality so pure (a combination of salt-spray from the sea, hundreds of thousands of Aleppo pines, and a unique geographical micro-climate) it\u2019s been proven to improve lung health. That and the blue water, the heat, and its relative affordability. Typically, visitors have rented mobile homes or stayed on the campsites, all of which are metres from a stony beach, and most of which have their own massage facilities \u2013 health drills deep here, wellness is not just for the wealthy. But one draw of the newly renovated luxury hotels is the scale of their offerings, vast modern spas, air-conditioned to a gentle chill. We are greeted at the Bellevue, its midcentury furniture suggesting a dozen new ways to relax, with the coldest glasses of water I\u2019ve ever tasted.\nThe spa here stretches across the basement of the white 1960s hotel \u2013 one end is dark-walled and soothing, with colour therapy and steam rooms, the other clinical and spare, offering Botox and cryotherapy.\nAfter checking in I walk through the piped music of its hallway, be-robed and dazed \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s the Lo\u0161inj air or perhaps the flight, but I feel almost medicated, floating.\nThe island is only 21 miles long and just under three miles wide \u2013 a coastal path wraps around the bay of \u010cikat, and a guide walks us along it into a forest to pick herbs and plants, which we take back to the spa to blend and distil into a balm. It smells like the island, a rich green scent which follows us as we trot around the cove that evening to a fish restaurant, Konoba Cigale, where the proximity to Venice shows in the menu \u2013 they stuff their homemade pasta with seafood caught that morning. Again, that blissful feeling overwhelmed me as our daughter danced to the accordion player and my partner and I looked at each other over our Istrian wine with a sort of stunned disbelief at the glory of it all, at the possibility of a holiday that feels like the photos.\nMorning came with birdsong. But, a moment here to discuss the breakfast buffet. Too often, I think, hotel guests become jaded by the intense joy delivered to them daily \u2013 this, too, is a side-effect of the holiday experience. A couple of days in and you no longer marvel at the blueness of the sea or the blueness of the sky, or the crisp affordability of the local wine, or, in the case of Lo\u0161inj, the smell, that leafy smell of health and wellness. But if you are four years old and enjoying your first hotel, the breakfast buffet in a grand lobby is by far the most exciting element of any holiday, and remains so every time you emerge from the lift, into this oasis of omelettes and fruit. For the stressed and old, wellness is a simplifying of one\u2019s polluted urban life; for children, it\u2019s cake for breakfast.\nA freediver ferried us on a speedboat around the bay, stopping to show us secluded caves where we could swim, eventually pulling up to a restaurant on the shore of the tiny car-free island of Ilovik. On the way back, our daughter slept by the engine of the boat in a nest of towels.\nThere was much we didn\u2019t do. We didn\u2019t visit the Museum of Apoxyomenos in the town of Mali Lo\u0161inj, which boasts a single exhibit \u2013 a Greek bronze statue of an athlete dating from the 1st century, found in the sea. We didn\u2019t cycle into the forests, or see a dolphin, or stumble into the naturist colony. We did, however, eat ice cream in the island\u2019s two fishing villages, Veli Lo\u0161inj and Mali Lo\u0161inj, and we did eat at the obscenely romantic Lanterna restaurant, in the shade of an old lighthouse, and we did take a taxi up to the Providenca at sunset, a viewpoint carved into a mountain top. And we did lie motionless on sunloungers with local aloe vera pulp smeared across our sunburned shoulders in the bloated afternoon sun.\nThough some wellness tourists expect to come home thinner, instead it felt as if we\u2019d returned with a gorgeous weightlessness, the result of a week on this perfumed island with its daily catches and clear water. We braced once more on the tiny plane, our teeth rattling as we insisted, dry-mouthed, that the wings were meant to wobble like that. At home it took some time to rejoin our old commuting routines, our school runs, our doom. Some time to recover from the undiluted joy of a holiday like this, one that left us feeling\u2026 better. A week\u2019s half-board stay in the four-star Family Hotel Vespera costs from \u00a3708pp. A week\u2019s half-board at the five-star Hotel Bellevue costs from \u00a31,514pp, losinj-hotels.com. British Airways and Croatian Airlines fly to Zagreb. Silver Air has launched summer-only scheduled flights to Lo\u0161inj from Zagreb, Venice and Lugano, silverairtravels.com\nThis year the \u201cwhite town\u201d of Vejer de la Frontera will see the return of a traditional hamam after an absence of several hundred years. Communal bathhouses were a common feature of Andalusian towns under Moorish rule. The Califa Hamam will combine a Roman-inspired caldarium, tepidarium and a frigidarium (hot, warm and cold baths) with a Moroccan steam room, massage room and a domed atrium where mint tea will be served. The company behind the new venture, the Califa Group, will also open a boutique hotel in Vejer\u2019s medieval old town this spring. Plaza No 18 will have six stylish guest rooms set within a 19th-century merchant\u2019s house with courtyard and roof terrace. Hotel and hamam packages will be available for a cosseting break.\n Double rooms at Plaza No 18 from \u00a3179. Prices for the hamam have yet to be released, califavejer.com\nFitness is the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll, if the recent proliferation of exercise-themed festivals is anything to go by \u2013 think Glastonbury with 5k runs instead of all-night raves. Love Trails is a family-friendly running festival in Dartmoor with scenic races and marathons for all ages and levels, forest school for children, yoga, wild swimming and live music (2-4 August, weekend tickets from \u00a320pp). The Love Trails Festival on the Gower Peninsula (4-7 July, tickets from \u00a362pp) takes a more hedonistic approach with pub-crawl runs and a line-up of bands alongside the race programme, campfire talks, wood-fired hot tubs and wellbeing workshops. At the Big Retreat in Pembrokeshire, you can choose from more than 200 fitness and wellbeing classes, plus creative workshops (24-27 May, early-bird adult weekend tickets with camping from \u00a3144).\nPeople have been coming to take the waters at Bad Ragaz for almost 800 years, ever since Benedictine monks first discovered the healing properties of the warm spring water. The Grand Resort Bad Ragaz is home to one of the leading medical spas in the world, but a night at the hotel here will set you back at least \u00a3300. However, you can bathe in those same mineral-rich waters for the less terrifying price of \u00a322. The Tamina Therme is a contemporary public bathhouse which opened in the town nine years ago. Forget any negative notions of municipal baths: this place is stunning, with soaring ceilings, marble floors and mountain views. The entry price gives you access to various indoor and outdoor pools, whirlpools, steam baths and saunas and, for an additional fee, you can book treatments such as Haki \u2013 a relaxing cross between massage and yoga.\n Entry to Tamina Therme costs from \u00a322 for up to 2 hours (taminatherme.ch). A double room at the Hotel Garni Torkelb\u00fcndte, a 500m walk from the Tamina Therme, costs from \u00a376 per night, torkelbuendte.ch\nSoul & Surf, which has gained a devoted following for its laid-back yoga and surf holidays in Kerala and Sri Lanka, will open its first permanent European base in Portugal in April. Following a series of successful pop-up retreats in the Algarve, the British founders Ed and Sofie Templeton will set up shop in a rustic Iberian farmhouse on the outskirts of Lagos, a 40-minute drive from Faro. This stretch of coastline is known for its great surf conditions for all abilities. Families are welcome and the company will launch some kid-friendly breaks later this year. \n A week\u2019s retreat costs from \u00a3712pp full-board, based on two sharing, including surf tuition, yoga and meditation sessions. Three-night breaks start from \u00a3370pp (soulsandsurf.com)\nIt would be hard to conjure up a more enchanting setting for a retreat than the village of Ulpotha, surrounded by jungle in central Sri Lanka, with a lotus-strewn freshwater lake for swimming. Despite its location and rustic accommodation \u2013 off-grid wattle-and-daub huts \u2013 its reputation attracts burned-out travellers from all over the world. Retreats run for a fortnight at a time for six months of the year (from November to March and June to August) with each one being led by a different yoga teacher.\n Two-week programmes cost from \u00a32,335pp including accommodation on a twin share basis, vegetarian meals, snacks, two yoga classes a day, a consultation with an Ayurveda doctor, a full day excursion per week, a massage per week (ulpotha.com)\nHike Caribbean has launched two new \u201chike and swim\u201d trips for 2019, combining challenging hikes with an open-water swim from Nevis to St Kitts. The group tours depart in March and will give participants the chance to summit the peaks of Nevis, Antigua and St Kitts. Tours will be timed to coincide with the annual 4km swim from Oualie Beach on Nevis to Cockleshell Beach on St Kitts on 31 March. It finishes with a breakfast party on the beach.\n Prices start from \u00a31,299pp for the seven-night Double Summit and Swim trip (departs 27 March). Includes accommodation, based on two sharing, transfers and inter-island flights (hikecaribbean.com)\nThe White Isle has reinvented itself in recent years as a wellness destination, a canny move given that its original clubbing clientele have (mostly) grown up and are more interested in soaking in a hot tub than dancing on a podium. At the forefront of this reinvention are two of the island\u2019s most iconic hotels. Atzaro \u2013 one of Ibiza\u2019s best-loved agroturismos, whose celebrity fans include Kate Hudson and Rihanna \u2013 has upgraded its spa facilities as part of a major revamp and launched walking and cycling breaks for winter and spring. Packages include guided hikes or bike rides with a nature guide, foraging for medicinal wild herbs and access to spa, yoga and wellness classes. In the evenings, chill out in the brand new Scandi-inspired garden sauna pod, or in front of one of the hotel\u2019s log fires. And for further proof that times are changing: Pikes, the party hotel where the video for Wham\u2019s Club Tropicana was famously shot, will host its first-ever fitness retreat this spring. The Rockovery Retreat is being billed as an extravaganza of \u201cfun, frolics and fitness\u201d.\n A three-night nature walking or biking package at Atzaro costs \u00a3595 (plus tax), based on two sharing a double room and B&B (atzaro.com). The three-night Rockovery Retreat at Pikes (12-15 May) costs \u00a31,352pp, including accommodation, meals, fitness training, yoga, talks and workshops (pikesibiza.com)\nMindfulness and environmental sustainability are the cornerstones of the Sharpham Trust, an educational charity based just outside Totnes in Devon. Most of the retreats are in the charity\u2019s Grade I-listed Georgian mansion, or in a barn set in its grounds, but if you really want to make a connection with nature, opt for one of the Woodland retreats which include accommodation in bell tents. The days include guided meditations, sensory exercises and periods of silence, with evenings around the campfire. For something more active, the popular Walking Retreats feature daily guided walks through the countryside, along the Devon coast path or in the Trust\u2019s Capability Brown-designed gardens.\n A three-night Nature Connection retreat costs \u00a3335, with full-board camping, next retreat 25 July; a four-night Mindfulness and Walking Retreat costs from \u00a3385pp including single-occupancy accommodation in the mansion, 13 May (sharphamtrust.org)\nAn estate in Tuscany, surrounded by lavender fields, vineyards and orchards is the new location for luxury retreat company in:spa. The family-run Locanda Cugnanello, which is 20 miles from Siena, features a luxurious villa alongside an 800-year-old farmhouse that blends rustic style with modern comforts. There are 12 comfortable guestrooms, a saltwater pool, outdoor sofas and a large hammock. Its rural location offers guests a peaceful retreat in which to detox and de-stress, with a combination of yoga and fitness classes, hikes, spa treatments and nutritional consultations. Also, new for this year, in:spa is offering guests the chance to sign up for a pre-retreat consultation with a health screening company who will check blood sugar, cardiovascular function and cholesterol levels and give recommendations on ways to improve health during the retreat. \n A week-long retreat costs from \u00a32,095pp, based on two sharing on an all-inclusive basis. Retreat dates are 4-11 May and 7-14 September. Pre-retreat health consultations cost \u00a3499 (inspa-retreats.com)\nGenevieve Fox defies her sons\u2019 scepticism \u2013 and her own expectations \u2013 on a fitness retreat\nTen days before my fitness bootcamp in Marbella, a friend came over and glanced at my fitness schedule, pinned to the fridge.\n\u201cIt says \u2018hit\u2019 here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut with two i\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cMust be a typo,\u201d I said. I hadn\u2019t looked at it.\nSeven days before I was due to meet my fitness fate, my 17-year-old son also looked at the schedule. He promptly telephoned his older brother, who then rang me.\n\u201cAbout this fitness thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re doing something called \u2018insanity\u2019. Are you sure about all this?\u201d\nMy sons expressing concern for their unfit mother. I was touched. And secretly alarmed. From Thursday afternoon until Sunday lunchtime, a new world awaited: of beach runs and burpees, fasted HIIT and tabatas, circuits and squat jumps.\nI emailed James Davis, who runs 38\u00b0N \u2013 specialising in luxury fitness retreats in Marbella and Ibiza \u2013 with his wife Claire.\n\u201cAm worried that I am too unfit to benefit from a weekend and that everyone else will be super-fit,\u201d I wrote.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a fitness benchmark. From there, we adapt the training to the individual.\u201d\nIn case he was lying, and because I dreaded the public humiliation more than the heart attack, I did some emergency pre-training: two jogs with the dog, one on my own, and two cycling and running sessions in a gym.\nThe day before departure, I emailed James again: \u201cAm slightly dreading being so hideously unfit.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone is at their own level,\u201d he replied, \u201con their own journey, and we\u2019ll have a great time.\u201d\nAnd I did. In the words of the late artist Louise Bourgeois: \u201cI have been to hell and back. And let me tell you, it was wonderful.\u201d\nIt really was. I did one form of high-intensity exercise after another, on the beach, on tarmac, in the gym. Just as Sisyphus pushed the rock up the mountain, so James and Claire pushed me on, and on.\nAt 8am, for three mornings running, I did \u201cFasted HIIT: Metcon\u201d. This translates as, skip breakfast, then do high intensity interval training and metabolic conditioning. I jumped through the rungs of a ladder on the sand, like footballers do; did star jumps and wished I had a pelvic floor; I saw, and swung, my first ever kettle bell, thrusting my hips outwards in what looked like a misguided mating call. I picked up two ropes thick enough to moor a tanker and tried, and failed, to wiggle them up and down. By Sunday morning, they were, if not ribbons in my hands, at least airborne.\nTwo boxing sessions with James and I was hooked. I\u2019ve since bought my own gloves and joined a boxing class. During the spin sessions, I slid off the saddle, swore volubly, sweated more, and felt like my legs were being ripped apart. But Claire got me through the pain barrier. She is dynamic, fun and magically motivating.\nI reported my triumphs, as well as the three-course lunches and sumptuous breakfast banquets overlooking the sea in this fabulous hotel, to the family. \u201cI\u2019m glad (and surprised) you\u2019re still alive,\u201d wrote my older son.\nI am surprised I\u2019ve since joined a gym, go to this gym, and have signed up to a 38\u00b0N bespoke, 28-day HIIT home workout plan \u2013 short bouts of exercise won\u2019t disrupt my day, so there\u2019s a high chance I\u2019ll do them, armed with my new, can-do mindset. I even fancy a 38\u00b0N pop-up fitness weekend in London later this year. I know I sound as if a cult has got me, but feeling energised is a revelation. Count me in.\n 38\u00b0N\u2019s Body: Reset Weekend at the Puente Romano Beach Resort and Spa, 7-10 March, costs \u00a31,399pp based on two people sharing (thirtyeightdegreesnorth.com)\nAre babies and relaxation incompatible? S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly finds out on a family spa break\n\u201cOh right\u2026 wow,\u201d replied one pal, when we said we were doing a spa break with our four-month old. \u201cGood for you,\u201d they added, in the strained, halted speech you\u2019d use if someone had announced their intention to eat the contents of a vacuum bag. Undeterred by such scepticism, we pledged to give it our all. The experience on offer seemed idyllic, two nights at a hotel and spa that catered specially to families, even babies. Taking a 90-minute train from Waterloo, we set out to do the unthinkable.\n\u201cNot much nightlife around,\u201d our cabbie said, just in case we\u2019d come to Brockenhurst in search of an active local grime scene. \u201cBut families love coming here for the views.\u201d On that point, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Around 15 miles southwest of Southampton, New Park Manor Hotel & Spa is set within the decidedly toothsome environs of the New Forest, and we hadn\u2019t been within its gates for 60 seconds before we sighted deer striding through the open park.\nThe manor itself is a grand old house that dates, in some form or another, to the 11th century. Since then it\u2019s been inhabited by lords, landowners and, at one point, Nell Gwyn, mistress of Charles II. It\u2019s only been operating as a hotel since 1970, which rather dashed my fond imaginings of William the Conqueror towelling down in the sauna after a busy day of mutton and jousting.\nWhile our room was prepared, we took in one of the nearby forest trails and found the effect so calming it took us a minute to realise our son was similarly transfixed himself. Ordinarily more of a picking-up-spoons-and-throwing-them guy, the perpetual fall of orange-red leaves had placed him in a state of cherubic hypnosis.\nNew Park Manor is part of the Luxury Family Hotels group, which specialises in providing plush but unfussy breaks for families, and we entered our room to find a cot, changing mat, baby swimming togs and a rubber duckie. Even better were the bright and colourful creche facilities, to which we delivered the boy for two hours on both days of our stay. Fears he would fret once we parted were, in the end, unfounded. One glance at his charming new handlers was enough to scrub us from his memory, allowing us to take in the luxuriously appointed spa while he was lavished with attention.\nLeaving the fickle brute to his new pals, we made our way to the spa for the pool, treatment rooms, sauna and sanarium. This last concept was previously unknown to me, and comprised a room that\u2019s basically a sauna, but at a lower temperature and slightly increased humidity. I found it had a gloriously balmy effect on my weary joints and, better still, the information plaque which listed the difference between it and a sauna was slightly obscured from view, so I could inform everyone who came in like some kind of spa connoisseur.\nMy wife and I both had deep-tissue massages, and were rendered pleasantly cross-eyed by Jeanette, who worked our tired muscles until our brains dissolved into warm goo. Upon collecting him from the creche, we took the boy for his first ever swim, an activity to which he took such an immediate and ecstatic liking, it might be the highlight of our entire trip. Better yet, the easy come and go of other families meant we never felt in anyone\u2019s way, and made us think a stay here would be truly ideal for slightly older children, as both the spa and the upstairs nook filled with books and toys, are perfect diversions for curious and mobile kids.\nWe ate in the restaurant both evenings. I particularly enjoyed the chowder and my wife nearly screamed at her menu, the first she\u2019d read in a while where vegetarian was not synonymous with \u201cyou can have mushroom risotto or some leaves\u201d. The restaurant even offered baby monitors in case our little Michael Phelps rose from his slumber. He did, on both evenings, but the process of jaunting upstairs to settle him was so pain-free, it made us reflect on the true success of what was a wonderful weekend. Holidaying with a baby isn\u2019t about having the work done for you; it\u2019s about providing the tools and environment to make that work more worth it than ever.\n The Baby\u2019s First Stay Away package costs from \u00a3469 for two nights, with dinner, including two 30-minute spa treatments, a two-hour creche session each day and welcome hamper (newparkmanorhotel.co.uk)\nCenter Parcs is known for many things \u2013 the weatherproof \u201csub-tropical swimming paradise\u201d and a mind-boggling array of child-pleasing activities \u2013 but it\u2019s not necessarily the first place you\u2019d head to in search of a zen-like state of relaxation. Which is a shame as its Aqua Sana spas are pretty good. The pick of the bunch is the spa at Center Parcs\u2019 Sherwood Forest site, which recently underwent a multi-million pound overhaul, resulting in a grown-up Scandinavian-inspired space which has been designed to make the most of the woodland environment and boasts the world\u2019s first \u201ctreetop sauna\u201d.

It was for this reason that pyschotherapist and author Danielle Marchant launched her Pause Retreats to give busy people a chance to step off the treadmill and take stock.

It\u2019s hot, really hot, with a gloopy, oily consistency making it move strangely \u2013 less like water than a thick milkshake. Wading in, I find it is also ridiculously buoyant. Infused with magnesium salts, it\u2019s three times denser than the Dead Sea. Why struggle to keep upright? I drop back and float. Blimey, it\u2019s relaxing. I feel weightless, and spend the prescribed 10 minutes watching clouds drift overhead.\nI\u2019m at the impressive Aquaforte spa, within Sardinia\u2019s Forte Village. When the resort built its six thalassotherapy pools 25 years ago, it was something of a pioneer. The pools become successively cooler and less murky as guests progress through each 90-minute circuit.\nThe second pool has a lower concentration of sea oil, plus anti-inflammatory aloe vera and mint. The third, is a sodium-rich pool with sea salt. The fourth is pure sea water with vigorous hydrojets. Pools five and six are the coldest \u2013 a refreshing 20C. They\u2019re all in an idyllic setting surrounded by trees.\n\u201cThe term thalassotherapy comes from the Greek and means sea treatment,\u201d says Dr Angelo Cerina, who created the spa in the 1990s. \u201cIt brings together a number of factors: climate, sun, wind, iodine-laden air, sand, muds and seaweed.\u201d\nEach pool is designed for a different effect: buoyancy in the first pool is to help post-traumatic recovery, and the salt level promotes powerful draining effects. The full circuit is recommended for skin disorders, such as psoriasis, and joint problems \u2013 and for people like me for, simply, wonderful relaxation.\n(Note: it\u2019s less relaxing if you shave your legs immediately before coming to the spa, because the salty water will sting like a thousand bees \u2013 but, happily, the sharp pain soon passes.)\nForte Village is a giant beach resort 45 minutes from Cagliari airport, but arranged to feel small \u2013 intimate and exclusive. It has variety of room options in its eight hotels dotted around the lush gardens, from the bijou to palatial villas. During high season there are 21 restaurants (Sardinian, Mexican, Brazilian, pizza, gourmet\u2026)\nAlso, in high season, however, Forte Village is expensive, the shops packed with slick designer labels and restaurants run by celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. We went in October when it was blissfully \u2013 sometimes eerily \u2013 quiet. Perfect for a spa break, and much easier on the wallet, though quite a few of the hotels, restaurants and facilities were closed.\nI was knackered and needed time-out, but others come for the high-tech medical centre, offering expert sports medicine, nutrition advice and osteopathy.\nIndeed, Forte Village is quite a magnet for top-ranking tennis players. While I was there, many up-and-coming pros worked out in the gym and relaxed their muscles in the pools after matches. Professor Pier Francesco Parra, medical specialist to the Italian Davis Cup national team who has treated the likes of Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams, is on hand during key periods to sort out the bad backs of the tennis players \u2013 and normal guests alike.\nThe 90-minute pool circuit is as active as I get during our short stay. When I\u2019ve dried off and wrapped myself in a fluffy bathrobe, I relax in the spa\u2019s beautiful reception, sipping herbal tea, and reading from the tempting menu of hands-on body treatments. Salt exfoliation, followed by Ayurvedic massage using warm Sardinian honey? Or a water-based massage while floating in pool three?\nI went for the first: wonderful. But the best thing about being at Forte Village is to visit those magic pools every day, wade into that murky-brown water, and repeat the restful circuit again and again. \n Forte Village Resort, Sardinia (fortevillageresort.com) offers three nights from \u00a3689pp, half board including return flights from Stansted with EasyJet (available April, May, September and October).

        "content": "After a tumultous week, the streets of the cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are likely to be quiet on Sunday as congregations file into churches to hear priests and preachers call for the Lord\u2019s blessing on a troubled land.\nFew doubt that the DRC is at a critical moment. The long-delayed elections that were finally held on 30 December could still be a turning point, leading the resource-rich nation to a better future. Or they could send the vast central African country, which has not known a peaceful transfer of power since it gained independence from Belgium in 1960, back into anarchy.\nSupporters of Martin Fayulu, a widely respected former business executive and parliamentarian, accuse F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, leader of the DRC\u2019s biggest opposition party, of doing a deal with outgoing president Joseph Kabila. The announced results bear no resemblance to the real vote, Fayulu has said.\nAcross the continent, the election and the post-poll power struggle pitting two opposition leaders against each otherhas been closely watched as almost everywhere else on the continent politics has reached a turning point. This year there will be more than 20 elections in Africa \u2013 from Algeria on the Mediterranean to the economic powerhouse of Nigeria in the west and in South Africa, on the continent\u2019s southern tip. Younger voters are demanding change from an ageing generation of leaders, who are now seen as repressive, not liberating. New dynamics have been unleashed by rapid urbanisation, economic growth and social media. A new crop of leaders is emerging.\nOne indicator is rising voter participation after a period of decline. \u201cWhere there is a sense that venal elites have stolen resources and are not delivering, there are strong protest votes. People sense they can really change things,\u201d said Alex Vines, director of Chatham House\u2019s Africa programme.\nIn the DRC, the stakes are higher than elsewhere. The 1997-2002 civil war killed five million people, but the importance attached to ensuring stability is a double-edged sword.\nIf it explains why the leaders of South Africa and Angola pushed Kabila, who took office in 2001, to hold elections, it also explains the absence of stronger statements voicing misgivings about possible manipulation to allow opposition leader Tshisekedi to take power.\nNic Cheeseman, an expert in African politics at Birmingham University, said many international actors were pulling their punches. There was a similar reaction to the military takeover in Zimbabwe in November 2017, which ended Robert Mugabe\u2019s 37-year rule and replaced him with ruling party stalwart Emmerson Mnangagwa, he said. \u201cIn Zimbabwe a coup was sold as a peaceful transition and that\u2019s what everyone wanted. It seems very similar [in the DRC]. It\u2019s a transition and relatively peaceful so far \u2026 so it is a way of making the continuity look like a change.\u201d\nComments by French and Belgian ministers on rigging allegations in the DRC rankled with African officials, said Peter Fabricius, an analyst in South Africa. \u201cImmediately, it became us and them. The attitude was: who are these outsiders from former colonial powers to tell us our elections aren\u2019t good enough?\u201d\nMany African leaders also face difficult elections. In Algeria it is unclear if Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81, will seek to prolong his rule but the political elite face deep anger and frustration. In Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari, 77, is seeking re-election, despite failing to deliver on promises to fight graft and defeat an Islamist insurgency. In South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the manifesto of the African National Congress (ANC)on Saturday. The party has been in power since the end of the apartheid regime 25 years ago, but corruption and economic mismanagement has undermined support.Ramaphosa needs to keep ANC\u2019s vote share above 60% to see off internal opponents \u2013 and relaunch its political fortunes in the future.\nSome analysts see a shift away from democratic aspiration in Africa and a growing desire for more authoritarian government. Even as Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, surfs a wave of popular enthusiasm as he moves his huge nation away from a hybrid Chinese model, there is a fear the strategy apparently pursued by Kabila in the DRC will be attractive to some leaders.\nCheeseman said few powers had criticised an election campaign during which major opposition figures were forced into exile, human rights abuses were widespread and untried voting machines were deployed.\n\u201cIf leaders can see that they can get away with that kind of election now \u2026 what is their motive to hold a better one in the future?\u201d he said.",

A new state translation of the Bible will establish a \u2018correct understanding\u2019 of the text\nIn late October, the pastor of one of China\u2019s best-known underground churches asked this of his congregation: had they successfully spread the gospel throughout their city? \u201cIf tomorrow morning the Early Rain Covenant Church suddenly disappeared from the city of Chengdu, if each of us vanished into thin air, would this city be any different? Would anyone miss us?\u201d said Wang Yi, leaning over his pulpit and pausing to let the question weigh on his audience. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nAlmost three months later, Wang\u2019s hypothetical scenario is being put to the test. The church in south-west China has been shuttered and Wang and his wife, Jiang Rong, remain in detention after police arrested more than 100 Early Rain church members in December. Many of those who haven\u2019t been detained are in hiding. Others have been sent away from Chengdu and barred from returning. Some, including Wang\u2019s mother and his young son, are under close surveillance. Wang and his wife are being charged for \u201cinciting subversion\u201d, a crime that carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison.\nNow the hall Wang preached from sits empty, the pulpit and cross that once hung behind him both gone. Prayer cushions have been replaced by a ping-pong table and a film of dust. New tenants, a construction company and a business association, occupy the three floors the church once rented. Plainclothes police stand outside, turning away those looking for the church.\nOne of the officers told the Observer: \u201cI have to tell you to leave and watch until you get in a car and go.\u201d\nEarly Rain is the latest victim of what Chinese Christians and rights activists say is the worst crackdown on religion since the country\u2019s Cultural Revolution, when Mao Zedong\u2019s government vowed to eradicate religion.\nResearchers say the current drive, fuelled by government unease over the growing number of Christians and their potential links to the west, is aimed not so much at destroying Christianity but bringing it to heel.\n\u201cThe government has orchestrated a campaign to \u2018sinicise\u2019 Christianity, to turn Christianity into a fully domesticated religion that would do the bidding of the party,\u201d said Lian Xi, a professor at Duke University in North Carolina, who focuses on Christianity in modern China.\nOver the past year, local governments have shut hundreds of unofficial congregations or \u201chouse churches\u201d that operate outside the government-approved church network, including Early Rain. A statement signed by 500 house church leaders in November says authorities have removed crosses from buildings, forced churches to hang the Chinese flag and sing patriotic songs, and barred minors from attending.\nChurchgoers say the situation will get worse as the campaign reaches more of the country. Another church in Chengdu was placed under investigation last week. Less than a week after the mass arrest of Early Rain members, police raided a children\u2019s Sunday school at a church in Guangzhou. Officials have also banned the 1,500-member Zion church in Beijing after its pastor refused to install CCTV.\nIn November the Guangzhou Bible Reformed Church was shut for the second time in three months. \u201cThe Chinese Communist party (CCP) wants to be the God of China and the Chinese people. But according to the Bible only God is God. The government is scared of the churches,\u201d said Huang Xiaoning, the church\u2019s pastor.\nLocal governments have also shut the state-approved \u201csanzi\u201d churches. Sunday schools and youth ministries have been banned. One of the first signs of a crackdown was when authorities forcibly removed more than 1,000 crosses from sanzi churches in Zhejiang province between 2014 and 2016.\n\u201cThe goal of the crackdown is not to eradicate religions,\u201d said Ying Fuk Tsang, director of the Christian Study Centre on Chinese Religion and Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cPresident Xi Jinping is trying to establish a new order on religion, suppressing its blistering development. [The government] aims to regulate the \u2018religious market\u2019 as a whole.\u201d\nWhile the CCP is officially atheist, Protestantism and Catholicism are two of five faiths sanctioned by the government and religious freedom has been enshrined in the constitution since the 1980s. For decades, authorities tolerated the house churches, which refused to register with government bodies that required church leaders to adapt teachings to follow party doctrine.\nAs China experienced an explosion in the number of religious believers, the government has grown wary of Christianity and Islam in particular, with their overseas links. In Xinjiang, a surveillance and internment system has been built for Muslim minorities, notably the Uighurs.\nXi has called for the country to guard against \u201cinfiltration\u201d through religion and extremist ideology.\n\u201cWhat happens in Xinjiang and what happens to house churches is connected,\u201d said Eva Pils, a professor of law at King\u2019s College London, focusing on human rights. \u201cThose kinds of new attitudes have translated into different types of measures against Christians, which amount to intensified persecution of religious groups.\u201d\nThere are at least 60 million Christians in China, spanning rural and urban areas. Congregation-based churches can organise large groups across the country and some have links with Christian groups abroad.\nPastors such as Wang of Early Rain are especially alarming for authorities. Under Wang, a legal scholar and public intellectual, the church has advocated for parents of children killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake \u2013 deaths many critics say were caused by poor government-run construction \u2013 or for families of those affected by faulty vaccines. Every year the church commemorates victims of the 4 June protests in 1989, which were forcibly put down by the Chinese military.\n\u201cEarly Rain church is one of the few who dare to face what is wrong in society,\u201d said one member. \u201cMost churches don\u2019t dare talk about this, but we obey strictly obey the Bible, and we don\u2019t avoid anything.\u201d\nWang and Early Rain belong to what some see as a new generation of Christians that has emerged alongside a growing civil rights movement. Increasingly, activist church leaders have taken inspiration from the democratising role the church played in eastern European countries in the Soviet bloc or South Korea under martial law, according to Lian. Several of China\u2019s most active human rights lawyers are Christians.\n\u201cThey have come to see the political potential of Christianity as a force for change,\u201d said Lian. \u201cWhat really makes the government nervous is Christianity\u2019s claim to universal rights and values.\u201d\nAs of 2018, the government has implemented sweeping rules on religious practices, adding more requirements for religious groups and barring unapproved organisations from engaging in any religious activity. But the campaign is not just about managing behaviour. One of the goals of a government work plan for \u201cpromoting Chinese Christianity\u201d between 2018 and 2022 is \u201cthought reform\u201d. The plan calls for \u201cretranslating and annotating\u201d the Bible, to find commonalities with socialism and establish a \u201ccorrect understanding\u201d of the text.\n\u201cTen years ago, we used to be able to say the party was not really interested in what people believed internally,\u201d said Pils. \u201cXi Jinping\u2019s response is much more invasive and it is in some ways returning to Mao-era attempts to control hearts and minds.\u201d\nBibles, sales of which have always been controlled in China, are no longer available for purchase online, a loophole that had existed for years. In December, Christmas celebrations were banned in several schools and cities across China.\n\u201cLast year\u2019s crackdown is the worst in three decades,\u201d said Bob Fu, the founder of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group based in the US.\nIn Chengdu, Early Rain has not vanished. Before the raid, a plan was in place to preserve the church, with those who were not arrested expected to keep it running, holding meetings wherever they could. Slowly, more Early Rain members are being released. As of 9 January, 25 were still in detention.\nThey maintain contact through encrypted platforms. On New Year\u2019s Eve, 300 people joined an online service, some from their homes, others from cars or workplaces, to pray for 2019. Others gather in small groups in restaurants and parks. One member, a student who was sent back to Guangzhou, said he preaches the gospel to the police who monitor him.\nThe church continues to send out daily scripture and posts videos of sermons. In one, pastor Wang alludes to the coming crackdown: \u201cIn this war, in Xinjiang, in Shanghai, in Beijing, in Chengdu, the rulers have chosen an enemy that can never be imprisoned \u2013 the soul of man. Therefore they are doomed to lose this war.\u201d",

        "content": "Harold Pinter theatre; Finborough, LondonThe surprises continue in an extraordinary Pinter season. Plus, the rise and rise of Sheila Atim\nIt has been hard to guess where lightning will strike in Jamie Lloyd\u2019s revelatory Harold Pinter season, which groups together the dramatist\u2019s short plays. The interest of Pinters Five and Six, directed respectively by Patrick Marber and Lloyd, is multifarious: historical, comical, alarming. For me, the high point was an apparently modest offering in Five (a triple bill of The Room/Victoria Station/ Family Voices). A tight two-hander written in 1982, Victoria Station delivers in one heated, bated breath a thriller, a comic turn and a metaphysical mystery.\nSoutra Gilmour (who designs the whole lot) has created an anti-advent calendar: no new birth at the end of this drama. Halfway up a huge brown wall, two windows are open, far apart. Colin McFarlane sits in golden light, staunch with thermos and muffler. He is the controller of a fleet of cabs, seeking a driver to go to Victoria station. Rupert Graves, lit with a silvery tinge, is fugitive \u2013 dodging the calls on his time, evasive about where he is. Marber\u2019s finely calibrated production draws on his own experience as a standup: the two bat around dialogue with top-notch timing. Yet the humour slides with complete naturalness into different registers: earthy and sinister, as Graves discloses that he has a recumbent female with him (\u201cI\u2019m keeping her\u201d); otherworldly and metaphorical as McFarlane proclaims himself \u201cappointed by God\u201d.\nThere are notes of Beckett, but they are delivered airily. The Room (1957) has a heavier hint at Waiting for Godot, in the sudden appearance of a blind man. It\u2019s a fascinating template for the later plays: an isolated couple; unexplained visitors; claustrophobia; bullying. Gilmour\u2019s chilly design and costumes show how easily cosiness can become bleak: the HP sauce; the electric bar fire; that headscarf. Jane Horrocks \u2013 peaky and garrulous \u2013 makes every stare over a teacup seem telling. But the plot moves in little runs; it could stop or start at any point. Not so Family Voices, written for radio in 1980, which spins fluidly along, with nuggety dialogue (\u201cher toes were quite restless\u201d) and Luke Thallon pulling off an extraordinary feat of multicasting, nimbly taking on both geezer and toff.\nIn Pinter Six, Lloyd ingeniously brings together two plays in which gaiety dances over chasms. Party Time (1991) twists around a neat pun. It is hinted that characters apparently meeting for cocktails may be part of another category of party, as socialites begin to look like apparatchiks. It is delivered with poise by the same actors who perform with buoyant extravagance in Celebration. This 2000 drama has always been a magnet for exceptional casting: the original Almeida production included Lindsay Duncan and Lia Williams \u2013 and a walk-on part for the then unknown playwright Nina Raine.\nCelia Imrie and Tracy-Ann Oberman are particularly glorious here, cleavaging away in spangly outfits and hair rampant; a fine contrast to the delicate coolness of Eleanor Matsuura\u2019s maitresse d\u2019. The brilliant central conceit tips its hat to Bernard Shaw, who in You Never Can Tell featured a waiter far wiser than the bigwigs he serves. Abraham Popoola has a lovely aplomb as Pinter\u2019s waiter who breaks into the babble of affluent diners with his observations about TS Eliot, the Austro-Hungarian empire and William Faulkner.\nLloyd directs with attention-grabbing pace but he knocks some of the nuance out of Pinter. Played boisterously over the top, with moues and flat vowels, it becomes a parody of the nouveau riche \u2013 a bit Abigail\u2019s Party and a touch snobbish. It would be equally funny and more penetrating done slightly posher. No faulting, though, the beautifully staged conclusion, in which Pinter goes beyond satire into dreamland.\nSheila Atim has had a tremendous few years. In 2016 she was transfixing as Ferdinand in the Donmar Tempest. Then she startled audiences with the direct force of her voice in Girl from the North Country. Now Ch\u00e9 Walker\u2019s production of his play Time Is Love/Tiempo es Amor lets us see close up, in the tiny Finborough, what makes her such a beacon as an actress. She has also composed the music that runs through the production as a soundscape of murmurs, rumbles of subterranean disturbance, enigmatic warning chimes. She has cited Stan Getz and Kendrick Lamar as influences. The effect is to summon up 21st-century Los Angeles.\nThere is a particular piquancy to her casting, as last year Atim appeared as Emilia in the Globe\u2019s Othello. Walker\u2019s episodic play takes off from some of the central themes of Shakespeare\u2019s play \u2013 the manipulation, the jealousy \u2013 but puts Latin Americans at the centre of the action, which is set often in prison and lap-dancing clubs and imagines what would have happened had Desdemona actually had an affair.\nWalker has been a compelling stage writer, as his 2008 Frontline and the subsequent success of Been So Long (which went from a 1998 Royal Court play to a 2018 Netflix film) has proved. But though Time Is Love sometimes flares into fervency, the drama sputters. The set-up of characters is not strong enough to make their disintegration matter; flashbacks confuse; the dialogue does not fight its way to clarity in the passages of untranslated Spanish. It is the performances that bring vivacity. Gabriel Akuwudike, as the man who seeks vengeance for being betrayed, is open and forceful. Atim \u2013 a lap dancer \u2013 is tremendous. She radiates power but never seems to impose it. At moments of greatest febrility she will slow down her speech, drop her voice, laugh. She never hurries a gesture. She has her own time. And the time is now.\nStar ratings (out of 5)\n  Pinter at the Pinter \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n  Time Is Love/Tiempo es Amor \u2605\u2605\u2605\n Pinter at the Pinter is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 26 January\n Time Is Love/Tiempo es Amor is at the Finborough, London, until 26 January",

        "content": "A long-held wish to bring the story of the Windrush generation and its descendants to a wider audience has come true for a leading director. But as Kwame Kwei-Armah\u2019s dramatic tribute \u2013 a series of televised monologues that will feature leading black actors including Lenny Henry \u2013 is announced this weekend, he is coming to terms with the death of his father a few days ago.\n\u201cIt is now very personal for me,\u201d said Kwei-Armah, whose mother died in 2005. \u201cI have been longing to make something that could be a tribute to my mother and father\u2019s experience [they arrived from Grenada in the early 1960s]. I did it to celebrate them and it means even more because of my father\u2019s death. I feel it will pay tribute.\u201d\nThe eight 15-minute films overseen by the director, Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle, are part of a diversity-themed season that runs on BBC Four next month, and were made for the channel by Henry\u2019s production company, Douglas Road, in collaboration with Kwei-Armah\u2019s London theatre, the Young Vic. They tell the chronological saga of a Caribbean family\u2019s arrival in Britain in 1948 and chart its progress down the decades, eventually projecting into the future.\n\u201cThe central provocation behind the idea was to wonder if this community will survive,\u201d Kwei-Armah said. \u201cWe are at a particularly significant moment in history and this story has been sitting in my conscience.\u201d\nThe former Casualty actor believes drama is the way to communicate the different social landscape of the past. \u201cI wanted to show that what people take for granted today was not always the case. Lenny and I have said to each other we are both in the legacy business now. So it is part of our responsibility as artists to tell these stories.\u201d\nThe writer, who made his name with the play Elmina\u2019s Kitchen in 2003, spent seven years running Baltimore\u2019s Center Stage theatre, which gave him a valuable lesson as an immigrant. \u201cI realised it is hard work. There are things I couldn\u2019t say, that Americans could, because from me it would sound like criticism.\u201d\nThe monologues have been written by different people, including the award-winning playwright Roy Williams, and tackle immigration and integration, as well as making reference to the Windrush scandal, which brought to light the uncertain citizenship of many who had lived, worked and paid taxes in Britain for decades.\n\u201cWe were mindful of not making it only a response to the Windrush scandal, but characters do refer to it. They also refer to other big issues, such as the Stephen Lawrence murder in the 1990s and the emergence of the hip-hop scene,\u201d Kwei-Armah said.\nThe 51-year-old director grew up in Southall, south-west London, with the name Ian Roberts. After watching the television series Roots, about slavery, he told his mother he would trace his family and take an African name.\nAt 19, while reading an autobiography of Malcolm X, he carried out this plan to reclaim his ancestral past, tracing his Ghanaian family tree back to the slave fort his great-great-great-grandfather was taken from.\nIn London, his father, Eric Roberts, worked at the local Quaker Oats factory. His mother, a nurse, took work as a hairdresser and a childminder to pay her son\u2019s fees at stage school.\nJonty Claypole, the BBC\u2019s head of arts, said the project is the first such collaboration with a theatre and external production team. \u201cIt was implicit from the start we would have a black cast and crew. This seemed like something television could do to mark the Windrush era.\u201dOther programmes in the season announced today by Claypole include a partnership with the Phoenix dance theatre, A Very British History, a factual series, and a documentary about photographer Don McCullin\u2019s travels across Britain.",

        "content": "It has been a grim decade for savers and it now appears younger people are looking closer to home in an attempt to make their money work. Consumer group Which? has found that well over half of young homeowners are overpaying on their mortgages, cutting the length of time they will have to pay back their house or flat loan.\nIt is little surprise, with high street rates at rock bottom after a dismal decade for savers. Many commentators are now actively encouraging people to look at increasing their repayments \u2013 if budgets allow.\nThe Which? research shows people in London and the West Midlands are the most likely to make larger repayments with the average at almost 15%.\n\u201cWhile it might be surprising to hear that so many people have paid off extra chunks recently, the benefits can be massive, cutting months off the length of your loan \u2013 and, in turn, saving hundreds or even thousands in interest,\u201d says David Blake from Which? Mortgage Advisors.\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t done so recently, you may want to look at your re-mortgaging options to ensure you\u2019re paying the best possible rate and have the flexibility to overpay when possible.\u201d\nFigures from Santander illustrate the effect of even small overpayments: \u00a310 more a month on a 25-year \u00a3200,000 mortgage would save \u00a31,146 in interest and be mortgage-free four months earlier; \u00a3100 a month on the same mortgage saves almost \u00a310,000 in interest and cuts three years off the life of the mortgage.\nWhile the vast majority of people use the extra repayment to reduce the length of the mortgage, a small number keep the same term, but reduce the amount they have to pay in the future. This gives homeowners some flexibility.\nBut there is not an unlimited amount that can be repaid. Some lenders limit the amount to 10% a year. Over that, fees may apply.\nMoneySavingExpert\u2019s Martin Lewis attributes the penalties to lenders having budgeted to make a certain amount from a mortgage and overpaying means that sum will be reduced. Anyone taking out a mortgage is advised to look carefully at the terms and conditions to see what the rules are.\nHowever, repaying early is not for everyone. It is important that debts are prioritised and those with high interest rates \u2013 credit cards, store cards and personal loans amongst others \u2013 are dealt with first.\nIt is also important for borrowers to make sure they have enough funds to cover the extra repayment without sacrificing other savings, such as money for an emergency.\nThere are other options to make a mortgage easier to deal with. For those who are able to switch, moving to a cheaper deal after an introductory period is finished, could result in savings.\nShortening the term of the loan may reduce the amount of interest paid, but it will increase the monthly repayments which borrowers should be sure they can budget for.\nWhile these are bad days for savers, anyone who thinks that they should repay early, rather than putting money in the bank, should examine the rates they are getting and do their sums accordingly, advises Lewis.\nIf you can get more in the bank than what you pay on your mortgage, then leave it in the bank. If the mortgage rate is higher, however, then look to overpay. This is also a good opportunity to ensure that you are getting the best bank rate as they vary widely.",

        "content": "The social historian on why he believes Britain may finally tackle the inequality perpetuated by independent education Read an extract from David Kynaston\u2019s Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem\nDavid Kynaston is a historian who has written books on postwar Britain, the City of London and cricket. His latest book, co-written with his old cricketing friend Francis Green, is called Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem, and focuses on the unfair advantage offered by the independent education sector.\nYou are known for your forensic histories of modern Britain. What inspired this book?\n It\u2019s an issue I\u2019ve become deeply interested in since my sons went to a state grammar school in 2007. They both played football for their school and standing on the touchline when they played against local private and state schools I saw the full spectrum of the unequal allocation of resources, the huge difference in the quality of facilities at state and private schools. The unfairness hit me terribly hard. A few years later in 2014 I gave the Orwell lecture, focusing on the private school question, and then at the end of that year my son George and I wrote a piece on the history and cultural significance of private schools in the New Statesman, which provoked five further articles the following week. That was the moment that made me think this was an issue that had some traction.\nYou argue that private schools add significantly to a child\u2019s socioeconomic opportunities. What do you think would have happened to you, had you not attended Wellington college?\n If one has had a very privileged education and then one achieves anything in adult life, there\u2019s always that nagging thought \u2013 how much is down to the fact that one had good fortune and others didn\u2019t? The academic advantages conferred by the private school are not dramatic but significant, and cumulatively over the course of a childhood they amount to quite a lot.\nWhat tangible advantages did going to private school give you?\n In my case, boarding school provided an escape from my parents\u2019 divorce. I was nine when it happened and school was friendly and cosy and it was nice to have another world to go to. Later, I had three very good history teachers and they really got me flying intellectually. In some ways I had better history teaching at school than I did when I was at Oxford. But perhaps the most important thing it gave me was confidence. Private-school students are taught that they are going to do well in life. That makes a huge psychological difference growing up.\nThere has been a discussion about reforming private schools for decades. Why has it not got anywhere?\n I think the liberal left find it a difficult issue because parents want to do the best for their children and if they can afford it they\u2019ll often educate their children privately, and that\u2019s entirely understandable. But attitudes become very entrenched when people have made a significant financial investment. And if one\u2019s been privately educated oneself there\u2019s the question of having advantages that others have not had, and then throwing away the ladder one\u2019s climbed up oneself.\nDo you think anything will change in your or your children\u2019s lifetime?\n It\u2019s not impossible because I believe that plates shift in history in a way that is often beyond the control of individuals. There was something plate-shifting about the 1945 election, which brought in the welfare state. I think the plates shifted again at the end of the 1970s and the Thatcher/Reagan era. Now, particularly since the financial crash, we are approaching the end of free-market orthodoxy and there is an anti-privilege mood around. It is hard to see how the private schools can escape from this unscathed.\nShould we bring back grammar schools?\n It is an important question and I am a bit conflicted. When grammar schools were phased out at the end of the 1960s, something was lost. At that point, they were offering real academic competition to the private schools. But you also had the problem of selection, division within families and three quarters of the population being written off. I think overall there was a good case for abolition but it was a debatable case. I am not nearly as unsympathetic towards grammars as I am towards private schools.\n  \nWhat should be done now?\n There\u2019s obviously the question of outright abolition, but in our view to aim at that is impractical because it would be such a difficult thing to achieve. My starting point is where we are at the moment, with these highly resourced schools for, on the whole, children of wealthy parents, entrenching already existing advantages. So anything, in a sense, is better than where we are now. We\u2019ve put our emphasis on changing the social composition of the schools. We call for a fair access scheme in which, initially, 33% of pupils at private schools would be state-subsidised.\nHave you had any interesting reactions to your book so far?\n Not yet, but I honestly do not know what to expect when it is published next month. We have tried to write it in a moderate way, keeping it evidence-based and non-agitprop, not attacking parents or making futile accusations of hypocrisy. If a lot of personal shit and mud gets thrown then I will be very sad because that is not the spirit in which the book is written. We are a mature democracy but we are not always able to talk about this subject in a mature way.",

Intouchables, the original French film on which this is based, starred Omar Sy as the ex-con who blags himself a job as the carer for a millionaire quadriplegic. This sluggish US remake trades the generous charm of Sy\u2019s affable screen presence for the niggling irritation of Kevin Hart. Everything that was already wrong with the original film \u2013 its sentimentality, its simplicity \u2013 is magnified. Bryan Cranston plays the venture capitalist who finds himself locked in the gilded cage of his own penthouse apartment following a paragliding accident. Nicole Kidman slips into sensible spectacles and the background as his loyal business manager. And the greatest hits of opera, bursting out of the soundtrack like an overbearing drunk at a party, are drowned out only by Hart\u2019s dental-drill delivery.",

We review four of the best\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nThe days of alarms and floodlights being the only choice for home security are behind us with the growing availability of more intelligent and flexible options, such as smart cameras.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nPlaced outside or within the home, these internet-connected cameras offer a live view of what\u2019s happening from practically anywhere, send alerts when they detect motion \u2013 and some can even recognise friend from foe. They promise full control and piece of mind through your smartphone, tablet or smart display.\nIf something suspicious is happening, you can fire off an alarm, alert the police or even shout at the intruder straight through the camera, all while recording their every move.\n\u00a3249 \nThe Ring Floodlight Cam combines, as the name might suggest, two articulated LED floodlights and a camera in one device, which make it perfect for replacement of traditional security lights in the back garden.\nLarger and more capable than its battery-driven siblings, the Floodlight Cam comes in black or white but requires wiring into the mains, most probably by an electrician. Once that hurdle is overcome, setup is straightforward using the Ring app on a smartphone or tablet.\nYou can activate a live stream at any time through the app, but it\u2019s the motion-activated smart alerts that are the main draw. You can set motion zones, filter alerts by size of object or just people, the time of day or day of the week.\nYou can also configure whether to trigger the floodlights, and there\u2019s a loud siren built into it for good measure. Not that the foxes invading my back garden paid any attention to either. The camera is weatherproof and comes with two-year theft protection, in case someone is brazen enough to unscrew it from your wall. The lights can be turned on manually too.\nThe camera records up to 1080p video and has a wide 270-degree field of view, digital zoom and night vision, and you can talk through the camera via the app. You get live view and alerts for free, but cloud recording costs \u00a32.50 a month for 60 days of event recording.\nVerdict: The Ring Floodlight Cam has bright lights, a good superwide-angle camera and a siren making for a good deterrent, but wiring it in requires a bit more than DIY. \nIndoor: \u00a3299; outdoor: \u00a3329 \nThe smartest camera here is also one of the most expensive. Google\u2019s Nest Cam IQ is a wired camera available in both indoor and outdoor variants. Both versions need plugging into the mains, which limits where you can put them compared to battery-powered products. But it also means you get the best-in-class camera, which captures up to 1080p video in HDR, a good 130-degree field-of-view and night vision.\nThe indoor Nest Cam IQ is a relatively attractive lollipop-style camera with wifi built in, which can be wall or ceiling mounted, but most will probably just put it on a bookshelf or something similar. The outdoor version is shaped like a large spotlight and is screwed into the wall on a rotating, angled bracket. An indoor plug comes with it, meant to be threaded through the wall into the back of the camera, but a weatherproof alternative is available to buy for \u00a349 if needed.\nWithout a Nest Aware subscription you get live video feeds, motion alerts and three hours of image snapshots of events in the Nest app on your smartphone or tablet.\nThings get a lot smarter with a \u00a34 per month 5-day Nest Aware subscription, adding continuous cloud recording, not just motion events, which makes it the best here for capturing everything that happens indoors or outside.\nYou also get smarter detection of events, activity zones, clips and time lapses in the app, brilliant motion gif alerts, and face recognition.\nBy tagging faces with names as they\u2019re detected you can get the camera to recognise whether a friend or family member has shown up rather than a stranger. It worked well after undergoing a bit of training to spot that me with glasses on, me with a hat and me buckling under the weight of Christmas shopping were all the same person.\nYou can talk through the camera via the app, or even access Google Assistant by saying \u201cHey, Google\u201d to the indoor version of the camera like one of Google\u2019s smart speakers.\nVerdict: It\u2019s expensive, but if you need high-quality continuous monitoring, the Nest Cam IQ is the smartest of smart cameras.\n\u00a3199 \nThe Logitech Circle 2 series of cameras that start at \u00a3169 for wired, or \u00a3199 for battery-powered, prove that feature packed flexibility needn\u2019t be complicated.\nThe little globe-shaped camera is simple to set up and use. Open the Logitech Circle app on your phone, connect the camera to wifi, place the camera somewhere and you\u2019re good to go \u2013 no need for another box or subscription.\nYou get 24 hours of cloud storage with video downloads and smart alerts free, plus a good 30-second summary of the day\u2019s action in the app. If you want more it\u2019s \u00a32.99 a month for 14-day cloud storage.\nThe Circle 2 is flexible too. Being weatherproof, it can be used indoors or out, has night vision, a 180-degree field of view and streams up to 1080p video. The camera bit unscrews from the back making swapping between mains and battery easy, while a variety of mounts mean you can stick it just about anywhere, including on the inside of a window looking out. It even proved durable enough to survive a couple of falls from my bannister, knocked off in the bluster of Christmas preparations.\nThe battery lasts around a month when placed in a hallway, or longer if there are fewer events to record, and you can talk through it to whoever comes calling using the app on your smartphone.\nVerdict: The Logitech Circle 2 is simple, flexible and adaptable, making it great for those who don\u2019t want to mess around with more advanced and costly systems.\n\u00a3347 \nThe Arlo Pro 2 consists of a battery-powered camera, which can also be plugged in, and a base station with a siren and local recording capability that connects to your router via ethernet.\nAt first the requirement for a base station was irritating, but I quickly found out that the ear-splitting siren makes for a much better alarm system. The cameras are small and weatherproof and can be stuck just about anywhere, with various mounts available.\nWhat they can do depends if they\u2019re on battery power or not. Plugged in, they offer up to three activity zones capturing a rolling three seconds before any event, sound detection and continuous recording. On battery power you\u2019re limited to motion-triggered recording and alerts, but the battery lasts around two months in medium-activity zones such as a hallway or much longer in a backyard alley.\nThe cameras capture up to 1080p video with a 130-degree field of view and night vision. You also get three seven-day cloud event recordings for up to five cameras. Paying \u00a36.49 takes that up to 30 days and 10 cameras, while \u00a36.99 a month per camera will record video 24/7 for 14 days.\nThe Arlo app is not quite as good as the Ring or Nest app, but still gets the basics right, handling setup fairly easily, alerts and live streams.\nVerdict: They aren\u2019t cheap, but if you need compact cameras all over your house and garden, even in awkward positions, then the Arlo Pro 2 is for you.",

        "content": "England go into the series with targets on their backs but Helen Housby expects her team to cope with the added pressure\nWhen England Netball sat down with three of their closest rivals to create the Quad Series this decade, their motivation was twofold. One factor was that a regular international showpiece beyond the four-yearly World Cup would play better with sponsors and broadcasters, who had previously been offered little in the way of a consistent calendar. Another was to ensure the best could complete against one another more often. The wisdom behind that thinking will be gloriously evident in Liverpool todayon Sunday.\nEngland will begin the competition\u2019s sixth edition with a match against New Zealand and its place in the public consciousness has never been higher. This was always intended to be netball\u2019s equivalent of rugby union\u2019s Six Nations, a stand-alone tournament whose kudos will grow as storylines are written and rivalries forged, and the events of last year have taken its allure to new levels.\n\u201cEverybody is coming out to beat England,\u201d says Helen Housby, who shot to fame when she scored the winning point in the Commonwealth Games final against Australia last April.\nWhile narratives of facing revenge on their own turf will certainly help attract the punters, the talk around Tracey Neville\u2019s England camp has centred more on this being the latest phase in a steady progression: a continuation of the development that has brought second-placed finishes in the past two Quad Series, along with that gold medal, and will carry on when Liverpool hosts the World Cup this summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about sticking to our processes, keeping our feet on the ground and working hard,\u201d says Housby, who has little truck with the idea \u2013 one that has particular currency Down Under \u2013 that England will be under unprecedented strain with a target attached to their back. \u201cI disagree with that,\u201d she says. \u201c2018 has gone now, it\u2019s done. Going into this I don\u2019t think we should feel any extra pressure. We just need to continue doing what we did last year: playing how we like to play, with freedom, expressing ourselves and enjoying being out on the court.\u201d\nWinning a Quad Series for the first time would be a logical next step for England, who will be able to call on shooter Jo Harten for the first time since September. Harten\u2019s last international appearance came against New Zealand in Auckland, where England won 52-39 before receiving a degree of payback from Australia in Newcastle, New South Wales, four days later. Her return helps ensure the core of the side will be familiar although, beyond the need to keep breaking new ground, some shadow boxing is inevitable too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last time [these teams] will see each other before the World Cup and everyone is looking to put a stake in the ground,\u201d says the England captain, Serena Guthrie. \u201cEveryone is bringing a slightly different team and our selection will probably look the most consistent. It\u2019s going to be about building relationships and feeling our way through the new-look New Zealand and Australia teams that show up.\u201d\nSouth Africa, who England play at London\u2019s Copper Box Arena next Saturday before a potentially decisive showdown with Australia the following day, make up the quartet although they have finished fourth in all five series. New Zealand\u2019s Silver Ferns, who have flagged in the past two years but are still regarded by Housby as \u201can incredible team that will come out fighting and won\u2019t be happy to lose any game against England\u201d are the priority and another win would help firm up the gains made last year.\n\u201cOur girls will want to keep their momentum,\u201d says Joanna Adams, the England Netball chief executive. \u201cThat Commonwealth Games was an historic moment but it can\u2019t be a one-off. To have this competition here, then a World Cup, is an alignment of the stars.\u201d\nThe long-term intention is for the Quad Series to be played once a year, scaled down from its current biannual format. Its organisers believe that would add to its sense of occasion, elevating the product once it has become a fixture in hearts and minds. For now, though, England cannot get enough.",

        "content": "The former Olympic champion hopes to win a different race, all for the public good and improving transport options for all\nIt is a Sherlock Holmes evening in south Manchester. There is a deep fog on an already black night, perfect for tail-coated villains to dart between the wheelie bins. But in a primary school hall the lights are on and a public meeting is taking place about a proposed local cycle route. There are a couple of councillors, engineers, 180 or so members of the public \u2013 the irate and the enthusiastic \u2013 and a world-record breaking and Olympic winning cyclist: Chris Boardman.\nThe microphone does not work, there are tetchy complaints about a phone vote and low-level tension plonks down in the corner. Boardman, here in his role as Manchester\u2019s cycling and walking tsar seems unfazed. He perches on the table, sticks a hand in his pocket and starts to speak. He is confident, blunt \u2013 and hackles visibly settle.\nIt is all a long way from Lycra-clad time trials. Boardman, 50 and who in 1994 became only the second British cyclist to wear the Tour de France\u2019s yellow jersey, retired from cycling in 2000 with the aim of doing \u201csod all\u201d. He and his wife had scaled their life down and Boardman was able to pick and choose jobs \u2013 before being sucked back in 2004 when asked to help a couple of coaches with \u201csome problematic athletes\u201d \u2013 including Bradley Wiggins. He then became head of British Cycling\u2019s Secret Squirrel Club \u2013 in charge of research and development \u2013 for the next two Olympics. He set up his own bike company and did TV commentary.\nBut it is this new role that has him up at night. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing in 20 years to do that because it\u2019s important,\u201d he says, earlier the same day, in a living room round the corner from the Co-op. \u201cPeople say do you enjoy it? No! I just feel this massive burden not to screw it up.\u201d\nManchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham, aims to turn the city into one of the greenest in Europe, and a place of mostly haphazard, sometime pot-holed cycle lanes, into the cycling capital of the country with 1,000 miles of network. Boardman has been given 10 years and \u00a31.5bn of ringfenced money.\nHe is confident he can change behaviour in this rainy city, where there are 250 million car journeys of less than 1km every year, where life expectancy is among the lowest in the country, where air pollution is too high, where people eat, drink and smoke too much and do not do enough exercise. It is also the first place in the world where Mobike, the Chinese cycle-sharing operator, withdrew because of antisocial behaviour. But Boardman sees only potential.\n\u201cI enjoy talking about this because it has absolutely nothing to do with cyclists. They might benefit but this is for people who drive because they\u2019re the ones who are going to want to change if it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\nHis criteria for success: doubling and doubling again cycling in Greater Manchester. Walking routes with space enough for a double buggy, a cycle network that can be handled by competent 12-year-olds and be trusted by their parents. His secret weapons: democracy, letting local communities plot their own routes, a joined-up network including, critically, junctions and \u201ctelling people if you don\u2019t want to do it, we won\u2019t do it. Then people say: \u2018Oh, we do\u2019, and you\u2019ve got a proper conversation on your hands.\u201d\nBoardman is no fanatic. He has two cars and spends lots of time on the M6, journeying from the Wirral, where he has lived most of his life. Nor was he a massive advocate for public cycling in his professional years. \u201cIt\u2019s a very self-centred existence being an athlete. You\u2019re incredibly selfish and encouraged to be so,\u201d he admits.\nBut he always had a thing for the outdoors \u2013 camping, scuba-diving \u2013 and he likes problem solving and logic. \u201cI realised the bike is a simple, cheap solution to so many of the problems we face, so why the hell aren\u2019t we doing it? Three hundred miles away from here 50% of kids ride to school every day, 30% of all journeys are by bike \u2013 in the Netherlands, in parts of Germany, in Denmark. Take anyone from here and stand them there and they\u2019ll say: \u2018I prefer this.\u2019 So it is such a sturdy soap box to stand on.\n\u201cPeople think the Netherlands have always been about bikes but they haven\u2019t. In the 1970s, because of child deaths on the streets and a looming oil crisis, they said: stop. They decided to change the way they used streets and put people first. Their spend went into public transport. They\u2019ve got a higher tax rate than we have but it is wonderfully civilised. We invested in private transport. We\u2019re not unusual, we just do the easy thing \u2013 and the car has always been easy until there\u2019s so many of them that it\u2019s not, and the consequences are becoming more and more apparent.\u201d\nBoardman\u2019s mother, Carol, was killed in a cycling accident in July 2016. Last month Liam Rosney admitted causing death by careless driving. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrifically ironic,\u201d Boardman says. \u201cI can\u2019t think about it because it would just destroy me. It\u2019s not just taking away someone\u2019s life. It\u2019s everything that\u2019s left behind. And we don\u2019t treat it as a crime. We say: \u2018Oh, what a shame.\u2019\u201d He sighs.\n\u201cThis, this is the biggest race I\u2019ve ever had. If we can change something as big as a city region and prove that it works, you have to believe the rest of the country will follow.\u201d",

        "content": "It is a crisp January morning at Wigan\u2019s training ground and Zak Hardaker is in his \u201chappy place\u201d. The 27-year-old has come in on his day off for kicking drills, preparing for his Warriors debut in a pre-season friendly at Salford next Sunday and as he sits down he tries to remember the last time we conducted an interview together.\nIt was September 2017 and a lot has happened since then. Hardaker is one of the most talented players of his generation, winning three Super League titles by the age of 24, but he has not played for 16 months after news broke of a positive test for cocaine, while playing for Castleford, days before their first Grand Final appearance. Unfortunately that is not where the controversy ends.\nThey say history has a habit of repeating itself and Hardaker can testify to that. After it was announced last summer that Wigan would give him the chance to resurrect his career, he was arrested and given a 20-month ban behind the wheel for drink-driving. That was the latest in a number of high-profile misdemeanours that have overshadowed his career, including being investigated by the police over an assault and receiving a five-match suspension for homophobic abuse.\n\u201cI was locked up overnight for 12 hours when I got arrested and after realising I wasn\u2019t going to be able to sleep I was staring at those empty white walls and wondered if this was it,\u201d Hardaker says. \u201cWigan had given me a chance I may not have deserved in truth and I\u2019d let them down. But they made it clear what I needed to do to save my career.\u201d\nHardaker is not foolish enough to believe his apologies mean a lot by now, given the number of controversies he has been embroiled in and last chances he has been handed. Many expected Wigan to tear up his five-year contract. Instead they stuck with him.\n\u201cIt was genuinely 50-50 whether we cut our losses at that point,\u201d says Wigan\u2019s director of rugby, Kris Radlinski, Hardaker\u2019s childhood idol. \u201cWe had a harsh meeting with him and explained he had some hurdles to clear to prove he belonged at this club.\u201d\nThat included Hardaker finally taking responsibility for his actions, which resulted in him checking himself into the Sporting Chance clinic last autumn. \u201cDrinking has been the issue that has led to 95% of my problems,\u201d says Hardaker, who underwent an alcohol rehabilitation course in the centre founded by the RFL\u2019s incoming president and former Arsenal stalwart, Tony Adams.\n\u201cI\u2019d reached a moment where me and my family realised I needed to do something to change my life, not just my career. You think you know all about yourself but when you\u2019re in a place like that, it teaches you to reassess. I\u2019ve apologised so many times before but I didn\u2019t know how to handle it when things went wrong. I had to accept I needed help, which was a big ask for a 27-year\u2011old, but I needed to.\u201d\nFor 26 days, rugby \u2013 and the distractions of home life \u2013 were off the agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s six hours away and it was about tackling your issues head-on rather than shrugging them off.\n\u201cI was lucky to be offered that chance and Wigan rang me every day, assuring me I had a future if I did the right things. I know people will struggle to believe this but I\u2019m sick of making the same mistakes. I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself in Sporting Chance.\u201d\nAside from his issues with alcohol and his high-profile drugs suspension, Hardaker has been fighting another battle: a lifelong struggle with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, though he stresses it is not the root of all his wrongdoings. \u201cMale mental health is very topical right now but I\u2019ve always been keen for my ADHD to be private, so it doesn\u2019t look like an excuse.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have sugary drinks or sweets when I was younger because of it, I had to do all sorts of unusual stuff and it\u2019s important people know that\u2019s a daily battle for me \u2013 but not while saying: \u2018This is why I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve done in the past.\u2019 It was 2016 when I knew it was becoming a real problem but I just tried to pretend it wasn\u2019t there. It\u2019s been difficult to live with at times.\u201d\nAfter leaving the clinic and resuming training with Wigan Hardaker began the process of moving away from his hometown of Pontefract for the first time. He believes that has also been crucial for his rehabilitation. \u201cBeing able to concentrate solely on rugby was why it was time to move,\u201d he says. \u201cAt home there were too many distractions to lead me astray. I\u2019m now in a town where rugby league is everything and the expectations of the people are huge.\u201d\nHardaker says he has not touched alcohol since the night he was arrested last September but for those who have followed his career, it is hard not to feel this has all been heard before. Does he accept it will be difficult to earn back the trust of the sport when his playing career resumes, with some arguing he has already had too many chances?\n\u201cI sincerely apologise for my actions and know it might take another five years for me to not do anything stupid, and people might think I\u2019ve turned a corner. Life now feels a lot clearer armed with what I learned at Sporting Chance. Previously, on days off, I\u2019d be sat around wondering what to do and it would normally end in me losing my head or going to the pub. But now I\u2019m much better prepared to deal with it.\u201d\nHardaker acknowledges the fierce public backlash his actions have provoked: \u201cSome comments I get on social media are very difficult to deal with and I\u2019ve stopped using Twitter because it\u2019s brutal.\u201d\nOne thing is clear: the former Man of Steel is itching to lay this latest tumultuous chapter of his career to rest by returning to rugby for good. \u201cI\u2019d be in a cell again if it went wrong one more time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t end well if rugby wasn\u2019t there for me because of my own mistakes.\n\u201cSeptember 25th was a defining moment in my life and there were times during the suspension when I wondered if packing rugby in would make all my problems go away. But I\u2019m back with a smile on my face, I\u2019ve found a way to deal with my problems for the first time and I\u2019m hungry to play. No more bad headlines, only good ones.\u201d\nRadlinski says: \u201cIt\u2019s early days but he\u2019s cleared a big hurdle with Sporting Chance. We want to be part of this journey with him and we think he can be the best player in the competition again \u2013 but it\u2019s up to him and nobody else now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all make a good book one day,\u201d Hardaker says with a smile as the end of our hour together nears. With the full-back now in his happy place once again, perhaps there could still be a good ending to this story. But only Hardaker can write the remaining chapters.",

        "content": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is \u201cfeeling a strong sense of trepidation\u201d ahead of a hunger strike she intends to start tomorrow, but will pursue the high-stakes strategy despite fears that the Iranian authorities will cut off her daughter\u2019s visits as a result, her husband has said.\nThe British-Iranian dual national plans to strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison, but will consider extending the protest if her demands to be seen by a doctor are not met, Richard Ratcliffe said.\n\u201cThe question is whether she\u2019ll just strike for the three days she announced or whether she\u2019ll decide to go on,\u201d said Ratcliffe, whose phone calls with his wife were cut back after she announced her plan to go on hunger strike. \u201cShe\u2019s giving slightly mixed messages, depending on whether she\u2019s feeling daunted or angry ... It\u2019s her decision to strike. Now she\u2019s made it, I think we will respond to how things develop and try not to feel too much panic.\u201d\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is an Iranian-British dual national who has been jailed in Iran since April 2016. She has been accused of attempting to orchestrate a \u201csoft overthrow\u201d of the Islamic Republic. She and her three-year-old daughter, Gabriella, were about to return to the UK from Iran after a family visit when she was arrested. Since then, she has spent most of her time in Evin prison in Tehran, separated from her daughter.\nIn January 2019 she went on hunger strike for three days in protest against being denied medical care in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison. In March, the UK Foreign Office granted her diplomatic protection, a step that raised her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.\nZaghari-Ratcliffe worked for BBC Media Action between February 2009 and October 2010 before moving to Thomson Reuters Foundation, the news agency\u2019s charitable arm, as a project manager. Her family has always said that she was in Iran on holiday.\u00a0\nRatcliffe said his wife was scared that her decision would result in further reprisals from the Iranian authorities after her food rations were cut last week and a programme was aired on state TV in Iran repeating allegations she is a British spy. In particular, the couple fear her twice-weekly visits with their daughter, Gabriella, will be stopped as punishment for the hunger strike.\n\u201cOutside contact has already been restricted,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cWhen she was in solitary confinement she went on hunger strike for six days and they sent her family in to plead with her. It\u2019s not impossible that family visits are disrupted for a bit. And then when she\u2019s weak and vulnerable, family is sent back in to plead she should end it.\u201d\nHe added that the Foreign Office had sent him advice stressing the negative physical effects of a hunger strike, which he found too painful to read closely. \u201cWe know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense, of trepidation. But there aren\u2019t many ways she can say, \u2018Enough is enough. Take me seriously\u2019,\u201d he said.\nRatcliffe said his wife, who is 40 and has been detained in Evin since her arrest in April 2016, had made the decision to strike because she wanted to send a message that she was \u201cat the end\u201d and \u201ccannot take any more\u201d.\nShe has been denied medical attention for lumps in her breasts and refused neurological care for neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, despite being referred by the prison doctor for specialist treatment for both. She has also been banned from seeing an outside psychiatrist.\nRatcliffe has been struggling to keep his wife\u2019s spirits up and simultaneously cope with his own anxieties. \u201cThis week I haven\u2019t gone to sleep before about 2am and I\u2019ve been waking up early. I carry on because you just do, don\u2019t you? But I\u2019ve been half dreading this moment and calming myself that the moment isn\u2019t actually here yet. It certainly feels like the stakes have risen significantly. I think we\u2019re on the precipice,\u201d he said.\nHe sees the decision to deny his wife treatment as an assertion of power by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. \u201cThey obviously don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to die this week and are just asserting that they are in charge. So everyone else can agree she needs medical treatment, and the Foreign Office can demand it, but they\u2019re the ones who give the say-so, and they haven\u2019t. That\u2019s my reading of it.\u201d\nNeither he nor Zaghari-Ratcliffe have been able to bring themselves to watch the lengthy TV documentary that was broadcast on Iranian state TV, showing secretly-filmed footage of her arrest at Tehran airport. \u201cThe other prisoners watched it. Nazanin couldn\u2019t watch it. She left the room. But she heard it and she heard again the voices of her interrogators ... I still haven\u2019t be able to watch it either.\u201d\nBoth of them found the broadcast shocking. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that, actually, all of this has been secretly filmed on a secret camera, perhaps hidden in a bag. It\u2019s very violating.\u201d He thinks broadcasting the footage was a way of sending a powerful message to the Iranian diaspora: \u201cWe can take who we want. No one can stop us. This could happen to you.\u201d\nRatcliffe met the British ambassador last week to find out what diplomatic discussions have been taking place behind the scenes and what the ultimate response of the British government will be if medical access continues to be denied to his wife. \u201cThe foreign secretary [Jeremy Hunt] made a clear ultimatum and got promises from the Iranian authorities they were going to give her the health treatment she needs. He said, do it or there will be consequences. Now Nazanin is essentially saying the same thing, there will be consequences if I don\u2019t get this treatment I need. The Iranian authorities are playing with fire.\u201d",

        "content": "When, early last June, the Italian football league agreed a \u20ac20m deal to play three of the next five Italian super cups in Saudi Arabia, it provoked very little controversy. This is, after all, a trophy that has frequently been decided on foreign soil, sometimes in quite unlikely locations.\nIn 2002, the year that Colonel Muammar Gaddafi bought 6.4m shares in Juventus, the Supercoppa brought the Turin side to play Parma in Tripoli. Since then the match has been hosted once by the United States, twice by Qatar and four times by China. Wednesday\u2019s game between Milan and Juve in Jeddah will be the sixth time in 10 years that the Supercoppa has been decided outside Europe.\nIt took until October before opposition to the match started to bubble and brew, as the murder of Jamal Khashoggi turned the spotlight on to associations \u2013 sporting and political \u2013 with the Saudis. \u201cWe must immediately reverse the decision to play the Supercoppa in Riyadh,\u201d said the former sports minister Luca Lotti, a member of parliament for the opposition Partito Democratico. \u201cThe world of sport cannot let itself fall behind. I can imagine that there are various economic interests behind this match but what took place in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul cannot pass in silence.\u201d He called on the government to \u201cuse all necessary measures to prevent Italian football from striking a blow against values and rights\u201d.\nIn November Gaetano Miccich\u00e8, the Serie A president, contacted the Italian ambassador in Riyadh to discuss whether to move the game and was strongly advised not to do so. \u201cFootball is a part of the Italian culture and economy and it cannot have an approach, certainly in the field of international relations, different to that of its homeland,\u201d Miccich\u00e8 said. \u201cSaudi Arabia is Italy\u2019s largest trading partner in the middle east. Dozens of important Italian companies trade there and have bases there, and none of these relationships have ended [since Khashoggi\u2019s murder]. With the approval of Fifa, Uefa and the Asian Confederation, we are going to play a match in a country with its own laws, created over many years, where local traditions impose constraints that cannot be changed overnight.\u201d\nControversy over the match ebbed for a while, until Serie A released ticket details at the start of this year \u2013 and revealed that large parts of the stadium would be out of bounds for women, who are permitted only inside designated family areas. The game sold out in a few hours but suddenly debate was as hot as the tickets. Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and a keen Milan fan, fumed: \u201cFor the Supercoppa to be played in an Islamic country where women cannot go into the stadium unless they are accompanied by a man is sad. It\u2019s disgusting. I won\u2019t watch the game.\u201d Giorgia Meloni, leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, said the game \u201cshould be organised in a country that respects our women and our values\u201d.\nOn Friday Codacons, a consumer and civil rights organisation, asked fans not to watch live coverage of the game, which will be shown by the public service broadcaster Rai, \u201cas a form of protest against the crazy policies of Saudi Arabia and the odious discrimination against women which is still rife not only in Arab countries but also in Italy\u201d.\nMiccich\u00e8, however, insisted the advent of family sections in Jeddah\u2019s King Abdullah Sports City Stadium was a positive development. \u201cThe Supercoppa will go down in history as the first official international football competition which Saudi women were permitted to watch live,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working to ensure that in the next games we will play in the country, women will be able to access all parts of the stadium.\u201d\nBut condemnation has not been universal. Giovanni Malag\u00f2, president of the Italian Olympic Association, said that those leading the outcry were engaged in \u201ca triumph of hypocrisy\u201d, having raised few objections to existing trade agreements between the countries. \u201cIf you take their money, you have to take what comes with it,\u201d said the television presenter Ilaria D\u2019Amica. \u201cOtherwise you need to make it clear from the start: I\u2019ll bring you the Supercoppa but in return we want respect for women. Instead, when the decision was made to play the game in Jeddah, everyone was silent.\u201d\nMilan qualified for the Supercoppa by reaching the final of last season\u2019s Italian Cup, where after a goalless first half Juventus eventually cantered to a 4-0 win. Juve lead Serie A by nine points, having won 17 and lost none of their 19 matches; Milan are 22 points behind after winning one of their last five. Hope for the Rossoneri comes from memories of the 2016 Supercoppa between the same teams in Doha, for which they were similarly unfancied but which they won on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\nThey will be without the Spanish forward Suso, suspended after being sent off against Spal at the end of December, while Juventus may also be missing a key attacker, with Mario Mandzukic ruled out of this weekend\u2019s cup game against Bologna with a thigh injury and considered doubtful. Consensus, however, is that Juve can win without Mandzukic while Milan cannot win without a miracle.\n\u201cEveryone agrees who the favourites are,\u201d says Davide Calabria, the Milan full-back. \u201cTheir players are at the highest level while our team is a work in progress. It will be hard to win but it\u2019s not impossible. We proved in Doha that they are not unbeatable. Even if we go into the game as underdogs, it starts at 0-0 and we\u2019ll give everything.\u201d",
