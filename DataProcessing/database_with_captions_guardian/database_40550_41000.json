        "content": "Inspiring, indiscreet and occasionally gasp-worthy \u2013 to mark the publication of Woody Allen\u2019s Apropos of Nothing, we arrange the best Tinseltown memoirs in order of excellence\nThe two volumes of Anjelica Huston\u2019s autobiography are a shrewd account of her life with wry comments on the alpha-males in it, including her father John Huston and longtime boyfriend Jack Nicholson.\nShe published this at 15 years old and like so many movie autobiographies, the title is a pre-emptive ironic twist on whatever the author is most famous for \u2013 in Drew Barrymore\u2019s case, a child-acting star turn in Steven Spielberg\u2019s classic ET, and then falling prey to substance abuse. As she says: \u201cI had my first drink at age nine, began smoking marijuana at 10, and at 12 took up cocaine.\u201d\nBette Davis published this autobiography in the 60s, at the end of her great period, and updated it in the 1980s \u2013 after her daughter BD Hyman published a Mommie Dearest-type memoir of her \u2013 detailing her life and times, with true leading-lady hauteur rising above the general awfulness and the fallout from four fraught marriages.\nThis bestseller from the golden-age legend Mary Astor recounted one of Hollywood\u2019s most scandalised lives. In 1936, she was divorced, after an affair with the dramatist George S Kaufman, and the press coverage became obsessed with her diary, which supposedly chronicled her sexual adventures. Much argued about in court, the diary was impounded in a bank vault and finally burnt.\nArt Linson (the producer of Fight Club) gives an amusing account of the unendingly humiliating business of a life spent trying to get movies made \u2013 there is a wince-inducing anecdote of trying to persuade Alec Baldwin to go back into his trailer and shave off the inappropriate straggly beard he had grown just before filming. Linson describes the process of sucking up to powerful people as \u201cbog snorkelling\u201d and \u201cgrabbing the knee pads\u201d.\nThe fatale screen-goddess\u2019s autobiography was written towards the end of her life, hitting back at her reputation for being difficult and recounting her professional partnerships with Joel McCrea and Alan Ladd \u2013 and with her legendary, lustrous hair, which she had to cut during the second world war to deter female factory workers from copying it.\nMia Farrow\u2019s autobiography was widely praised for her eloquent memoirs, recounting her troubled family life and her relationships with Frank Sinatra, Andr\u00e9 Previn and most dramatically of all, Woody Allen. The book was published five years after she first made public allegations that he had sexually molested seven-year-old Dylan, which he has consistently denied, which were investigated by the authorities and for which no charges were brought.\nThe suave and mellifluous actor\u2019s memoir sported jovially with his onscreen reputation, recounting his remarkable early life in Russia, his character-acting adventures in Hollywood and his marriage to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Written before his slide into ill-health and depression, it maintains a dapper jauntiness.\nIt was the courage and uncompromising commitment of Rose McGowan that formed the arrowhead of the #MeToo movement and the campaign to bring Harvey Weinstein to book. Part of what this memoir does is tell us what lies beneath a lot of Hollywood\u2019s racy anecdotes and gossip: a world of abuse and bad faith.\nThe producer Julia Phillips became the first woman to get a best picture Oscar with The Sting in 1973 and she was a driving force behind Taxi Driver in 1976 \u2013 but it was this tell-all book about the cocaine-fuelled, vanity-charged horror of Hollywood that made her a legend. (Cocaine use bankrupted Phillips.) David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss came off as ego-addled narcissists and the book so infuriated the industry that she really was banned from Morton\u2019s, the A-listers\u2019 restaurant.\nMichael Caine\u2019s three books of autobiography and his meandering thoughts on the acting craft give us his life from his beginnings as Maurice Micklewhite from a working-class family to his success in Swinging London and his breakthrough roles in Alfie, Zulu and The Italian Job. He recounts a legendary meeting with John Wayne in the lobby of a Hollywood hotel who advised him: \u201cTalk low, talk slow, and don\u2019t say much\u201d. Perhaps Caine\u2019s legendary delivery really is the Brit version of Wayne.\nIn the 50s, Tab Hunter was an impossibly gorgeous slice of B-movie beefcake, a sexy actor and singer for whom Jack Warner created Warner Bros Records. Hunter tells us how, despite being intensively marketed to swooning women, he in fact preferred men, in an era in which homophobic paranoia went hand-in-hand with red-baiting \u2013 and had affairs with Anthony Perkins and the figure-skater Ronnie Robertson.\nKatharine Hepburn\u2019s garrulous, wayward memoir is a fluent and engaging but scattershot performance (in which you can clearly imagine the famous quavering Bryn Mawr voice) perhaps designed to keep at bay those who would take too close an interest in her private life. She handles tactfully her relationships with Howard Hughes and her legendary co-star Spencer Tracy, and gives nothing to those readers who believed that she was gay.\nA massive bestseller in its day, with an aspirational title that is sometimes mockingly extended with \u201c\u2026 if Frank Sinatra says it\u2019s OK\u201d in honour of the line from This Is Spinal Tap about his perceived subservient position to Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes in the Las Vegas Rat Pack. Despite the conservatism of his later years, when he endorsed the presidency of Richard Nixon, his battle against racism is stirring. There is an extraordinary, Ballardian description of how he lost his eye in a car accident \u2013 it fell prey to the bullet-shaped horn button on the steering wheel of his 1954 Cadillac. Davis gallantly helped the other driver out of her car with the eye still dangling out of its socket.\nChaplin brought a richly Dickensian flair to this autobiography: with the same mix of sadness, sentimentality, humour and warmth that formed the bedrock of the Hollywood storytelling style he pioneered. He gave it to us in three acts: the grinding poverty in London; the staggering success in Hollywood; and then the chilly anti-communist cold shoulder and final retreat to that well-known leftwing enclave, Switzerland. Chaplin name-checks grand acquaintances such as the Prince of Wales, but he isn\u2019t big on acknowledging other silent-movie greats and is reticent about his love life.\nBoorman, one of many movie directors who turn out to be beautiful writers as well, vividly and disarmingly describes his childhood in south London and then in Ireland with the kind of engagement that he would show in his great personal film Hope and Glory. He gets his start making documentaries at the BBC, and then there are his experiences in Hollywood dealing with the fragile egos of Burt Reynolds, Richard Burton and Marlon Brando, who pointedly told Boorman what Michael Winner had said to him: \u201cYou are a great actor, I am not a great director, please do whatever you like.\u201d\nThe impossibly handsome Tony Curtis matured from being a B-movie swashbuckler into a brilliant dramatic and comic actor. After a depiction of his tough upbringing in the Bronx, New York, he gives a seductive view of the Hollywood playground, and his meetings with Laurence Olivier, Frank Sinatra and Billy Wilder. His subsequent book detailed the making of Some Like It Hot and his complex relationship with Monroe, with whom he had had a relationship that flowered again during filming (he was married to Janet Leigh, she to Arthur Miller). This resulted in a pregnancy that miscarried.\nTowards the end of her life, Louise Brooks revealed herself to be a great writer about the film business and this memoir, published when she was 78, cemented her reputation. Like so many stories of early Hollywood, it is the story of an inventor and a pioneer, someone who helped create a whole language now taken for granted. After her dull Kansas childhood, Brooks came to New York in the 1920s as a dancer and made the acquaintance of Walter Wanger, Herman Mankiewicz and Charlie Chaplin, but found greatness in Europe with the Austrian director GW Pabst. Her glossy bob hairstyle became a daring sexual brand identity, but this strong, vital woman found herself frozen out of Hollywood by its tetchy menfolk.\nKirk Douglas\u2019s story of his rise to greatness in the Hollywood golden age with movies including Champion, Spartacus, Paths of Glory and Ace in the Hole is a compelling read, for the blistering energy (reproduced in his prose) with which he strove to get away from his former poverty, and his rage at himself for not having confronted the antisemites earlier in his life. Despite his 65-year marriage, Douglas was serially unfaithful, and the book is naive about sexual politics, but there are some ripe stories about his relationships with Rita Hayworth, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford. While lovemaking on her rug, Crawford disconcertingly murmured to him: \u201cYou\u2019re so clean. It\u2019s wonderful that you shaved your armpits when you made Champion.\u201d\nLauren Bacall describes her career on Broadway and in Hollywood, her marriages to Humphrey Bogart and Jason Robards, and her affair with Frank Sinatra (who features as anecdote fodder in so many of the books about this period). She was a Jewish girl dreaming of being like Bette Davis, and made her mark first as a fashion model who caught the attention of Howard Hawks who cast her in To Have And Have Not, where she began an affair with Bogart, her married co-star, who was 25 years older \u2013 although their subsequent marriage was very happy. This was the love of Bacall\u2019s life.\nCo-written with the seasoned Hollywood ghostwriter Earl Conrad, this book was completed just before the death of the singing and acting star Dandridge, the first African-American to receive a best actress Oscar nomination (for Carmen Jones in 1954). She was a pioneering activist who had to contend with sexism and racism, and her career \u2013 after the sensational Carmen Jones \u2013 was hampered by her lover and director Otto Preminger, who told her to accept only leading roles. This was well-meaning but ill-judged advice. She was a campaigner with the NAACP and introduced Martin Luther King Jr at one event.\nThese two parts of Michael Powell\u2019s autobiography \u2013 he was the legendary director who worked with Emeric Pressburger \u2013 are an essential account of cinephilia and movie creativity. His is a compelling story of his early career in silent movies, working with Rex Ingram and then Alfred Hitchcock, his later collaboration with Pressburger and then the passionate admiration of Martin Scorsese, which effectively relaunched his reputation in the 1970s. Powell writes simply but rather movingly about falling in love with Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese\u2019s brilliant editor, and their subsequent marriage.\nMade into a movie in 2002, this memoir from the legendary actor-turned-Paramount producer is a great Hollywood insider tell-all, with a title quoting Darryl Zanuck\u2019s remark when some of Evans\u2019s erstwhile acting colleagues demanded he be fired from the 1957 film The Sun Also Rises. He was married many times, including to the Love Story star Ali MacGraw, and as a producer, he was the driving force behind Love Story, Rosemary\u2019s Baby, Chinatown and The Godfather \u2013 but also the notorious flop, The Cotton Club. To make it, he associated with a shady financial backer called Roy Radin, whose drug connections and contract-killing murder resulted in a trial in which Evans scandalised the business by refusing to testify. He was himself convicted of cocaine trafficking in 1980, but always claimed he was only a user.\nFor many, this memoir is the primal scene of Hollywood family dysfunction, with a title that has become ironic shorthand for bad parenting. Christina Crawford was the adopted daughter of Joan Crawford. Her book alleged that Joan was a controlling, boozing tyrant who would beat Christina and who was more interested in her (flagging) career and many affairs with men and women than in being a mother. And then in later life, when Christina had an acting career, she insisted on temporarily taking over Christina\u2019s role in a TV soap called The Secret Storm, as Christina was in hospital for a cyst removal: at the time, Christina was 24 and Joan was 60. Perhaps this extraordinary fact alone would be enough to damn Joan Crawford, but many of her friends and her first husband Douglas Fairbanks Jr denounced the stories as untrue.\nThis is the unchallenged champ of the Hollywood memoirs: glamorous, louche, exciting, amusing, name-dropping, ridiculous, outrageously sexual but seasoned with real tenderness and piquancy as Niven describes his unhappy childhood, the heartbreaking loss of his first wife, and also his military service in the second world war, which involved an encounter with Winston Churchill, who congratulated him on quitting the movies to volunteer, but added: \u201cYoung man, you did a fine thing to give up your film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so it would have been despicable.\u201d Unlike most movie memoirs, there is no tough upbringing in the slums: Niven\u2019s childhood was comfortable (though unhappy); he was the public schoolboy who went from Stowe to Sandhurst and, unlike so many Brit actors who had learned to fabricate a posh voice in rep, Niven\u2019s was the real thing, and his authentic light charm entranced Samuel Goldwyn at the high point of Hollywood\u2019s golden age. His book is packed with anecdotes about Hollywood pals, including the notorious Errol Flynn, but the most extraordinary anecdote is about losing his virginity at 14 to a Piccadilly sex worker. Before they went to bed, she told him to \u201cwash\u201d in a kidney-shaped metal bowl by the bed. \u201cNot yer hands!\u201d she then rasped. Since the book\u2019s publication, its mythology has been debunked, Niven was subsequently found to have concealed the extent of his compulsive infidelities and created the fiction of a happy second marriage, and even exaggerated a little his commitment to serving in the British Army during the war. But this book is addictive and unmissable.",

        "content": "Richard Lewis, the outgoing chief executive of Wimbledon, hopes tennis can be \u201coff and running again\u201d by August, when the US Open is scheduled to begin, although he admits there may be \u201cno more tennis this year\u201d.\nSpeaking the day after the All England Club finally cancelled the championships for the first time since the second world war, Lewis acknowledged that uncertainty has gripped tennis because of the continued spread of coronavirus.\n\u201cWho knows what will happen over that period?\u201d he said on Thursday of the summer to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for everybody. Let\u2019s hope the US Open and Roland Garros [rescheduled to start a week after the conclusion of the US Open] can take place. It would be genuinely wonderful if the sport was off and running again.\n\u201cThe optimist in me \u2013 and I am often not optimistic \u2013 still hopes the American hard-court season, the big tournaments, the Masters and the Premiers, will take place: Montreal, Toronto and then Cincinnati. But we all know that\u2019s probably tenuous at the moment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unrealistic to say that there may be no more tennis this year. But I would like to think that things will settle down so that tournaments can be played sooner rather than later.\u201d\nLewis, who quits at the end of July after running the tournament for eight years to make way for Sally Bolton, also hopes the former champions Roger Federer and Serena Williams, who hold 15 Wimbledon titles between them, can play when the championships resume in the summer of 2021.\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to see both of them back. It\u2019s something to look forward to, and we\u2019ll hopefully enjoy it all the more, a silver lining to come out of it.\u201d\nWhen news broke that the 134th edition of the championships would have to be abandoned, the former British No 1 Annabel Croft described the dilemma for Federer and Williams as \u201ca nightmare\u201d. The Swiss, recovering from knee surgery, is on a record 20 majors, one ahead of Rafael Nadal and three in front of Novak Djokovic, while Williams remains one short of Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 grand slam titles. Both are 38 years old and their chances of returning to the game after an extended absence depend on their fitness and continued enthusiasm.\nAlso unknown is how much of a hole cancellation will put in an estimated \u00a3250m revenue at Wimbledon. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have the insurance and it helps,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe insurers, the brokers and everybody involved have been excellent to work with so far, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u201d\nHe said the annual windfall from that which goes to the Lawn Tennis Association, estimated at more than \u00a340m, should be safe. \u201cThe insurance will help protect the surplus to a large extent. The details and the figure probably won\u2019t be known for months.\u201d\nThese are all daunting challenges for Bolton, the first woman to hold the club\u2019s chief executive job, although Nora Cleather was the acting secretary during the second world war. The surreal atmosphere and circumstances in the year of the virus might well feel like those of 1939-45 for Bolton, a widely respected sports administrator for more than 25 years, having worked in both rugby codes, athletics, and as head of corporate affairs at the All England Club since 2016.",

The apparent shortage of everyday essentials has been less well-documented and comes a fortnight before coronavirus admissions are expected to peak.\nAt least nine NHS trusts have turned to Amazon wishlists to ask for toiletries for staff and patients, making requests for thousands of sanitary products, body wash, shampoo, lip balm, face wipes, and hand cream.\nHospitals have also asked the public to donate new pillows, pillowcases, towels, nightwear and sleeping bags . One trust even requested camp beds for medics to sleep on.\nMedics at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex, asked for disposable clog shoes and empty bottles of nail polish remover to fill with their own antibacterial hand gel. An appeal set up by a local company had secured donations by Wednesday of 25 pairs of clogs, 100 sanitary products, 40 packs of shower gel, 40 walkie talkies, 40 phone charges and 50 razors.\nOne trust based at Northampton General hospital requested donations of dermatological cream and moisturising lotion. Hinchingbrooke and Peterborough hospitals asked for extra supplies of hand cream.\nNurses at Norwich and Norfolk University hospital asked for 20 iPads so patients could \u201cspeak and see families whilst they are in hospital during Covid-19\u201d. They also requested hundreds of packs of toiletries and hand cream for staff treating patients with coronavirus.\nNancy Fontaine, the chief nurse and director of infection prevention at the hospital, said: \u201cWe have received so many donations, such as kitchen equipment for pop-up staff areas, shower gels for staff and lovely cakes. We are sincerely grateful and ask that it keeps coming. The items we have added to our wishlist are to enhance patient and staff experience during this difficult time.\u201d\nSwansea Bay health board also appealed for donations of dressing gowns, slippers and sanitary towels for patients. In a post on its charity Facebook page, it said patients were running out of toiletries and clean nightclothes because almost all visits had been cancelled because of coronavirus. \u201cThis is already a problem and likely to get worse in the weeks ahead,\u201d it said.\nThere were also requests for pens, plastic cutlery, disposable plates, instant soups and noodles, hot chocolate, teabags, coffee, porridge, soft drinks and energy bars for overworked medics.\nStaff at the Whittington Health NHS trust in north London were in need of shower gel, toothpaste and other toiletries. Tony Rice, the chair of the trust\u2019s charitable funds, said: \u201cOur staff are currently working around the clock to ensure that all of our patients, including those with Covid-19, receive safe, effective and compassionate care. This means having to work longer shifts than usual and additional pressure and stress.\n\u201cWe want to use the money donated to our Coronavirus Crisis Fund to provide the little comforts that our staff have told us would make their lives easier during this challenging time.\u201d",

This has been a really successful collaboration with the BrewDog team and we look forward to getting the gel fully operational in health and care settings right across Grampian. \u200b We at no time \u2018rejected\u2019 the offer, we instead chose to work together on finding a solution.\u201d\u200b\nBrewDog\u2019s founder, James Watt, said it had distributed 100,000 bottles of sanitiser to groups including the Archie Foundation and Aberlour children\u2019s charities and would continue to supply frontline workers and charities.\nHe said: \u201cWe started making hand sanitiser at our distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, in response to the national shortage and are doing everything we can to help.\n\u201cThe production of sanitiser is completely new for us, we are working closely with the NHS to understand how we can best meet their requirements for clinical care.\u201d \nBrewDog began producing sanitiser last month amid shortages of the alcohol-based hand cleaner, which has been flagged as an important tool in combatting coronavirus.\n This article was amended on 2 April 2020. The headline and introduction were updated to clarify that it was the initial batch of BrewDog hand sanitiser that was turned down by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary because it did not meet clinical standards. As the text made clear, the brewer and the NHS trust hope to produce a hand gel that is suitable for hospital use.",

        "content": "Some British sporting bodies, including those sending athletes to next year\u2019s Olympics, fear they could go under because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian can reveal.\nA handful of national governing bodies have privately told UK Sport that they face an existential threat because of the crisis, while at least a dozen more say they are facing a severe financial hit with events being cancelled and other sources of revenue being slashed.\nOne chief executive admitted that his sport would lose more than \u00a31m in the next six months if the shutdown continues, and said his situation was not unique.\nLast month UK Sport sent a spreadsheet to every Olympic sport to find out the likely financial damage to medal programmes from Covid-19, and to identify which bodies are in distress or could face an insolvency risk in the next three months.\nEach organisation was asked to use a traffic light system to conduct a financial health check to assess the scale of the problem \u2013 with red being on the brink of going bust, amber having a significant financial impact on the organisation, and green meaning they were fairly sustainable.\nSports bodies were also asked what the implications might be if the crisis lasted for six months, and to outline what financial help they would require. It was also emphasised that UK Sport wanted to ensure that they were still able to support medal-winning performances in Tokyo.\nUK Sport\u2019s approach appears to have been widely welcomed, with one chief executive praising them for taking a \u201cproactive approach in these absolutely unprecedented times\u201d. However, he also admitted: \u201cThere are a lot of concerns in the sector that income is being turned off.\u201d\nAnother senior figure said that sports face a delicate balancing act, on the one hand trying to stay alive while also not wanting to appear in any way demanding given the stress the NHS and economy is under.\n\u201cThere is an incredible sensitivity around this issue,\u201d he added. \u201cClearly funding for the NHS and getting through this as a nation is far more important. But at the same time, if we don\u2019t get support, then sports like ours will find it very difficult to recover.\u201d\nBodies who get most of their funding from UK Sport, which has given Olympic and Paralympic sport \u00a3374m over the past four years, are not thought to be under great threat. However, sports with more diverse income streams, such as athletics, cycling and badminton, face being hit much harder because they rely on a combination of TV money, hosting events, membership fees, and sponsorship, much of which will not kick in if sport remains on lockdown.\nOne chief executive said he expected that sport would not get back to normal until September at the earliest and said there was added pressure because \u201cthe sponsorship market for Olympic and Paralympic sports is not strong right now\u201d.\nOther organisations, such as England Athletics and Scotland Athletics, are said to be concerned about a drop in membership fees from runners unable to use facilities or coaching at their local clubs for the foreseeable future. Another source said it was still unclear whether sporting bodies in receipt of government money would be able to furlough staff if the financial crisis worsens.\n\u201cThe one thing I would add is that Sport England, UK Sport and the DCMS are doing an amazing job,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are genuinely looking at helping governing bodies as well as the grassroots. The Sport England funding will be a lifeline for many community sports, for instance. But this is a really significant challenge for all of us.\u201d\nA UK Sport spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cThe current situation caused by coronavirus and the cancellation of the sporting calendar for the foreseeable future has created some immediate and significant future financial challenges for several national governing bodies.\n\u201cIn response, we are actively engaging with all Olympic and Paralympic sports to better understand their unique circumstance and remain in active dialogue with government to explore options to support those organisations most at risk.\n\u201cWe are also conscious of the wider environment and the fact that essential government services, especially healthcare, must be prioritised. However, we recognise the risk to NGBs and are committed to doing everything in our power to support them.\u201d",

        "content": "Consultant in respiratory medicine and leader in the global fight against TB and lung disease\nFew did more to help doctors recognise and treat severe lung disease than the American clinical researcher John F Murray, who has died, aged 92, of respiratory complications arising from Covid-19. For much of his career Murray provided international leadership in efforts to contain the scourge of tuberculosis, the leading cause of death from infection globally, at 1.5 million people every year.\nOne of Murray\u2019s major research contributions was to expand the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the condition that eventually killed him, to include a wider range of signs and symptoms.\nUsing the battery of diagnostic tests he proposed, doctors are able to work out how severely a patient\u2019s lungs are affected. The group of tests gives a \u201cMurray score\u201d, which helps the doctor to decide whether the patient can cope with conventional ventilation (via a tube inserted into their windpipe), or needs to have their blood oxygenated artificially outside the body (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). This research is highly relevant to the current situation, with the massively increased demand for ventilation in Covid-19 patients.\nMurray never went into private practice. For most of his career as a clinician, he chose to work at the San Francisco general hospital, a public hospital that treated people from the poorest and most deprived neighbourhoods in the city, where he was chief of the pulmonary division from 1966 to 1989 and set up the first intensive care unit.\nThe hospital has an excellent TB clinic, and although Murray himself was not a TB specialist, many of those that he trained have gone on to be leading figures in the fight against the disease.\nDuring the early 1980s, the hospital saw many of the first cases of Aids, and in response Murray convened the first of several workshops, under the auspices of the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, to develop an understanding of how Aids affects the lungs. He also warned that HIV was leading to an increase in cases of TB. \u201cThe major place of tuberculosis should not be forgotten \u2013 as it is,\u201d he told the Union World Conference on Lung Health in 1990, \u201cand TB should be considered when allocating health care resources \u2013 as it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nMurray was instrumental in establishing respiratory medicine as a discipline separate from cardiovascular medicine, helping to raise the profile of the lungs in a world where heart and brain steal most of the limelight. On the international stage, he was involved for more than 40 years in the work of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (the Union), based in Paris. As its secretary general, he extended the scope of the organisation to diseases other than TB, and made its membership much less exclusive. In his clinical practice he had always made a point of including nurses and other health professionals, patients and their relatives in discussions about the best approach in any individual case.\nBorn in Mineola, a village on Long Island in New York state, John was the son of Frederick \u201cFeg\u201d Murray, the cartoonist and former Olympic hurdler, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Hanna). The family moved early in John\u2019s childhood to Los Angeles, where they lived in some style thanks to the success of Feg\u2019s nationally syndicated comic strips.\nJohn attended Los Angeles high school and after a period of wartime national service in the US navy as a radar engineer entered Stanford University, where he graduated in medicine in 1953. He completed his training in San Francisco, New York and London, before embarking on his long career as a senior clinician at San Francisco general hospital and professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).\nPaula Fujiwara, who trained under him as a junior doctor in intensive care and later became his colleague in the Union, vividly remembers the experience of presenting cases to him, an immensely tall and hawk-like figure in a bow tie, and the fountain of expertise he would produce in response. While most clinical professors might prefer to teach young doctors at the end of their first clinical year, Murray always opted to take the first month, July, with newly graduated medical students who had no idea what they were doing.\nCommitted as much to communication as to research, in 1976 Murray published The Normal Lung, a detailed account of lung development and function from birth to death. He went on to co-edit (with a fellow UCSF chest specialist, Jay Nadel) the classic two-volume textbook Murray and Nadel\u2019s Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, first published in 1988 and currently in its sixth edition. He was working on a seventh when he died. Anticipating the current trend for memoirs from the medical front line, he also published Intensive Care: A Doctor\u2019s Journal in 2000.\nHis first marriage, to Sarah Sherman, ended in divorce in 1966. Three years later Murray married the novelist and screenwriter Diane Johnson. He moved as easily in literary circles as medical ones. A workaholic, in his rare off-duty moments Murray enjoyed fly-fishing. Since he retired from San Francisco general in 1994, he and Diane had lived for much of each year in Paris, where he retained a small office in the headquarters of the Union to work on his books and journal editing.\nDiane survives him, as do his children, Douglas and Elizabeth, from his first marriage, and his stepchildren, Kevin, Simon, Darcy and Amanda, and 14 grandchildren. His eldest son, James, predeceased him.\n John Frederick Murray, consultant in respiratory medicine, born 8 June 1927; died 24 March 2020",

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nAcross the country, lovers of camping are pitching their tents in gardens or living rooms, complete with marshmallows for toasting and guitars to play around mock campfires. Emma Cuff of West Malling in Kent is among the small but growing group of indoor campers dusting off their tents. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four camping trips booked this summer which may or may not go ahead, so for some fun we dug out an old tent from the loft.\u201d She posted the results on Instagram with the hashtag #thevirtualcampsite \u2013 and won a tent from Cool Camping, one of several companies encouraging people to post their home creations on social media. This week Cool Camping is giving away a pair of hiking boots to the best effort. Outdoor gear retailer Cotswold Outdoor and review site TentLife are both hosting virtual camp outs this Easter (the former\u2019s virtual Easter camp is on Saturday 11 April, #campingathome; the latter is promoting #stayhomecamp all weekend). Go Outdoors plans to offer tips in its GO Indoors project. The upside? Rain can\u2019t ruin an indoor camping trip.\nIn other indoor antics, adventure travel company Much Better Adventures has put together a spoof self-guided itinerary on its site, which includes the \u201cCamino de Kitchen-Living Room pilgrimage\u201d and \u201cwild camping in your Living Room National Park.\u201d So far one person has attempted to book the trip.\nMeanwhile, outdoor swimmers have been trying to get that cold-water high in their gardens and bathrooms. Deya Ward posted photos of her wheelie bin dip on Instagram (\u201cthe quarry is small, so I recommend maybe dipping solo \u2013 but I highly recommend if you are also after the cold swim feeling\u201d). Others are attempting the #virtualicemile, like Becca Harvey from Bristol who wrote of her wheelbarrow swim: \u201cLaughter and community are the remedy to most problems and by god, as swimmers we\u2019ve got that in spades.\u201d\nIf you would like to tell us about the inventive ways you are getting your outdoor fix at home, share them on Instagram with the hashtag #guardiantravelsnaps.

Doctors are continuing to see patients after they have been assessed.\nOne is the concern around the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), which is already in short supply to NHS workers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get pharmacists on the government\u2019s list of those who need PPE,\u201d said Leyla Hannbeck, the chief executive officer of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, which represents more than 2,000 independent pharmacies around the UK.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a real drop in capacity and shortage of staff as the crisis has gone on and our members are eager to stay open. We are very clear with regards to the government\u2019s advice on safeguarding, but there are still some owners who may be older who feel that they need to continue working.\u201d\nPharmacists have also suffered in other ways from falling outside the provisions offered to NHS staff when it comes to the challenge of buying food. Some were denied access to special shopping hours at supermarkets because they did not have an NHS card, according to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS), the sector\u2019s body.\nIt has written to the British Retail Consortium to raise concerns about the approach taken by some supermarket chains, and called on companies including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s to ensure that pharmacists are given access.\nThe increasing abuse has also been raised by the RPS with the National Police Chief\u2019s Council, which has advised pharmacies to report incidents so that forces can build up a picture of the problem and respond to it.\nSixteen per cent of pharmacists surveyed by Pharmacy Magazine over the weekend of March 28-29 reported a rise in physical abuse.\nOne told of \u201cverbal abuse, emotional blackmail, failure to observe social distancing, queue-jumping [and] generally selfish behaviour\u201d, while another spoke of \u201chuge amounts\u201d of verbal abuse\u201d over the phone, adding: \u201cStaff have been told: \u2018I hope you get the virus\u2019 or \u2018I hope you die from coronavirus\u2019 multiple times per day \u2026 Most of the abuse is from the over-60s.\u201d\nNicola Goodberry, a pharmacist in Doncaster, said aggressive behaviour by some customers had increased after the government introduced social distancing measures last month.\n\u201cAfter the advice came in, we had to limit the number of people coming in at one time, and that has led to grief. Unfortunately, we are seeing some people behave in a very out-of-character way when they have experienced delays, in some cases swearing and even throwing boxes of tablets at staff.\u201d\nWhile some pharmacies have been erecting perspex glass screens at their own expense, Goodberry said this was not always possible and that the layout in her premises would not allow for this.\nStaff in major high-street chains too have experienced the wrath of stressed customers. Boots, which is running a campaign called #prescribekindness aimed at encouraging kind behaviour, has meanwhile distributed 2,500 Perspex screens for its counters \u2013 one per store \u2013 ordered 20,000 mobile lightweight versions and supplied all stores with PPE equipment including gloves, face masks, visors and aprons.\nA manager of Boots in Cardiff praised his staff on a LinkedIn post, but added: \u201cThe abuse they\u2019ve endured on a daily basis since the outbreak of this virus is unfathomable.\n\u201cFor people to think they have the right to behave in the way they have is completely unbelievable. All I have seen on social media is people criticising pharmacists for keeping them waiting, making them queue, being out of stock of Calpol, I could go on. I have been called names, spat at, had to listen to my team as they tell me about the abuse they have endured. It breaks me.\u201d",

So it made us fall out of our dentist\u2019s chair to learn Edward Paul Sheringham MBE, the man that adage was written for, has turned 54 (FIFTY-FOUR). First of all: happy birthday, Teddy! Second: can we voluntarily furlough ourselves for a lockdown period spent watching late-1990s highlight reels?\nIn truth that\u2019s how thousands of us are spending our time anyway, isn\u2019t it? Be honest. The curious thing about Clever Teddy was that he only became mainstream from his mid-20s onwards \u2013 coincidentally from around 1992, when he celebrated his 26th (sob) birthday and joined Spurs from Forest. That happens to be The Year Football Began, obviously, so our Shezzler timed things pretty perfectly: he will forever be synonymous with those fertile early years of the Premier League when the glitz didn\u2019t seem too glitzy and the entire sport hadn\u2019t run away from itself. Good times, basically. Teddy Sheringham reminds you of good times.\nJust like the goals against Holland in Euro 96 or, to all bar the most vehement of ABUs, That Magical Night in 1999. Few of us need an excuse to wax nostalgic at the moment and there\u2019s a fair chance Sheringham, for anyone aged between 35 and 50, epitomises the best of that era \u2013 a bit of fun, a bit of daring, the optimism and knowingness of Cool Britannia with something intangibly raffish behind it all. The debate would rage over whether a player with his style, touch and intelligence would survive in today\u2019s top flight without a burst of speed or thighs of steel; on balance you\u2019d fear for him but, if it is true that you can\u2019t lose what you never had, he\u2019s presumably still dropping deep to carve out space for a rampaging young centre-forward on a rec near you.\nSo perhaps, in the latest virtual pub gatherings, we should all raise a glass to Teddy and memories of \u2013 in some ways at least \u2013 a slightly more innocent era. Just don\u2019t bother sending that Zoom invite to his old foe Andy Cole, who in 2010 wrote that he would \u201crather sit down and have a cuppa with Neil Ruddock, who broke my leg in two places since 1996, than with Teddy Sheringham, who I\u2019ve pretty much detested for the last 15 years\u201d. That all came about because Sheringham failed to shake Cole\u2019s hand on his England debut. Looking back now from a socially-distanced world, perhaps he was just ahead of his time. Either way, it\u2019ll be Drambuies and tequila all round for The Fiver, albeit from a sofa rather than a pretend dental surgery, and they\u2019ll be raised to a player who let those good times roll.\nThe latest Football Weekly Extra podcast features Max and Barry in conversation with Philippe Auclair on Fifa, board games and Eric Cantona.

We\u2019ve stopped, no team will return as before, the matches will be behind closed doors, plus there\u2019s a risk to the health of the athletes. For me to go back to business is pure madness.

But viewers can still expect to gorge on two and a half hours of highlights from the night of Friday 27 July 2012.\nInstead of the Euro 2020 football tournament, which has also been pushed back by a year, the BBC will show matches from Euro 96 and other European championships as live, alongside highlight packages. There will also be classic Wimbledon contests on our screens during the July fortnight normally turned over to tennis.\nAll of this is being done in the hope that reliving great moments of old will not only help struggling BBC schedulers left with hundreds of empty hours to fill, but distract the rest of Britain from ongoing lockdown.\nThe BBC\u2019s director of sport, Barbara Slater, said there was \u201csomething for everyone\u201d in the package. \u201cIn these unprecedented and difficult times we are delighted to bring some of the most incredible sporting events from years gone by to our audiences over the next few months,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom glorious moments at the Olympics including the magic of London 2012, thrilling Euro 96 matches, wonderful Wimbledon moments and the best of World Championship snooker, there is something for everyone to enjoy.\u201d\nAlongside big replayed events, the BBC has other tricks up its sleeve. Match of the Day will become Match of their Day as pundits pick their favourite matches in Premier League history and analyse the highlights. In cricket, with England\u2019s summer series against Sri Lanka postponed, Test Match Special is to curate 40 of the best \u201cFrom the Boundary\u201d features where celebrities discuss their relationship with the game. There will also be an expanded range of podcasts, including the venerable Question of Sport, which is to move to the radio for the first time, to be broadcast on Radio 5 Live.",

        "content": "Concern that police crackdown to tackle public health emergency will disproportionately affect vulnerable people\nEating a kebab on a bench, washing car windscreens at an intersection or sitting in a stationary car \u2013 these are just some of the reasons more than 50 people have been fined by police in New South Wales and Victoria for violating new coronavirus laws.\nSweeping new laws introduced to slow the number of people infected with the virus have reshaped Australian society in the past fortnight, imposing an unprecedented crackdown on public movement and curtailing civil liberties.\nBut while governments and police agencies say the laws are necessary given the public health emergency caused by the coronavirus, justice advocates warn the laws could have damaging consequences for traditionally over-policed communities.\nThanks to a string of public health orders issued by health ministers across Australia, police in most states now have the power to fine or arrest people caught gathering in groups of more than two or for being outside of their homes without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d.\nBreaching the orders is punishable in NSW by fines for individuals of up to $11,000 or six months in prison, or both, and in Victoria by fines of up to $19,800 through courts and $1,652 on the spot.\nThe bulk of the punishments have been issued in NSW and Victoria, where more than 50 fines have been handed out. Since 17 March two people in NSW have also been handed court attendance notices.\nOn Wednesday alone police in NSW fined 13 people for breaching the orders. In some cases, fines came after repeated warnings or while in the process of committing other crimes.\nOne 21-year-old man was fined $1,000 when he was spotted eating a kebab on a bench in Newcastle after ignoring two warnings by police earlier in the day.\nIn Albury a 51-year-old man was fined after he was involved in a minor car accident and allegedly told police he had left his home in order to visit his drug dealer. He was later found to have a disqualified driving licence.\nBut in other cases people were simply deemed to be outside without an excuse.\nA 32-year-old woman and a 27-year-old man from Muswellbrook in the state\u2019s Hunter Valley were fined for sitting in their car without \u201ca reasonable excuse not to be at home\u201d. A 34-year-old woman who was stopped at a roadside breath test in Moree was fined for the same reason.\nOn Thursday the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said the rules were necessary to \u201csave lives\u201d.\n\u201cThe important thing is that people comply with the two-person rule when doing exercise, or that they only exercise with their household,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs I keep saying, a good rule of thumb is that if you are questioning whether you should be doing something, it is best to give it a miss.\u201d\nBut justice advocates say this sort of broad discretion attached to harsh fines and possible jail times could have dire consequences for the people who come into contact with police the most.\nPolice accountability solicitor from the Redfern Legal Centre in Sydney, Samantha Lee, said police should be \u201cprovided with clear and rigorous guidance as to the application of these laws, and directed to issue a warning and a fine should be an absolute last resort\u201d.\n\u201cThis is one of the largest on-the-spot fines available to police, and one of the most complex pieces of public health legislation,\u201d Lee said.\n\u201cKeeping the community safe is vitally important, but we are concerned these fines will disproportionately affect people already experiencing vulnerability, including young people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and those who have just lost their job.\u201d\nShe said the fact the fines were not means-tested and could be applied to children as young as 10 meant they would have greater impact on those with lesser means to pay them.\n\u201cThe impact of fines often propels already marginalised people straight into the criminal justice system, simply because they are unable to pay,\u201d she said.\nSimilarly Jonathon Hunyor, the chief executive of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Sydney, said he was concerned about the potential for the laws to be used against vulnerable communities such as the homeless.\nWhile orders restricting public movement contain an exemption for homelessness, gatherings do not, something that could have negative consequences for people sleeping rough.\n\u201cOften homeless people will sleep near others because of the availability of shelter or safety and what we\u2019re concerned about is if it is used in a way that effectively criminalises rough sleepers trying to stay safe,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a protocol for homelessness in public spaces that police are signed on to and a fundamental principle of that is don\u2019t bother people minding their own business. We want to make sure that holds because those interactions are what lead to other offences like offensive behaviour or language.\u201d\nOther states have not disclosed how many fines they have issued. South Australia and Tasmania did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia, while Queensland police would not say how many people have been fined under public health orders.\nHowever it appears the state may have applied leniency to many instances amid \u201cconfusion\u201d about some of the new regulations.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday night, police said they would need to seek clarity about some elements of the state regulations. \n \u201cI understand there is confusion around what people can and can\u2019t do and we will aim to clarify directions as they come into force,\u201d deputy commissioner Steve Gollschewski said.\n \u201cBlatant disregard of the directions such as house parties will be enforced. Police will use discretion in other instances acting on intelligence or reported complaints.\u201d",

Zoombombings are possible because the company\u2019s product is built for use in cases where every caller is part of the same company, or already known to each other, security experts say \u2013 an assumption that no longer fits after weeks in lockdown.\n\u201cWe now have a much broader set of users who are utilising our product in a myriad of unexpected ways,\u201d Yuan said, \u201cpresenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived.\u201d Zoombombings can be prevented by changing the app\u2019s settings, Zoom said in late March as the problem was growing. And other tools, such as YouTube or Twitch livestreams, may be more appropriate for some uses, such as a broadcast of an author reading their book.\nOther problems were more baked into the product, however. In July 2019, before it exploded in popularity, Zoom faced an embarrassing security scandal.A researcher discovered that the company installed some code on Macs alongside its app that meant that even if the app was later uninstalled, a single click on a web link was all it took to reinstall the app and join a new conference call with mic and camera enabled. Zoom initially defended the flaw for more than 90 days, saying it was a feature intended to make it easy for users to join calls. Only when the researcher went public did the company act. Apple later pushed a software update to all Macs that automatically prevented the feature from working.\nThat episode left security researchers suspicious of the company, and when it burst into the public\u2019s consciousness in March, the suspicion returned. In just a couple of weeks, researchers found many more flaws, major and minor, which piled up faster than Zoom could fix them, from a broken promise to provide \u201cend to end encryption\u201d for video calls to bugs that would allow a hacker to gain access to a user\u2019s webcam and microphone.\n\u201cSo many of Zoom\u2019s poor decisions were about prioritising growth over security,\u201d said the analyst Ben Thompson. \u201cThis crisis, though, more than takes care of growth: it\u2019s up to Zoom to seize the opportunity to prioritise security in a transparent and verifiable way at a time when all of their customers want them to succeed.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what the company is promising now, founder Yuan says. Over the next 90 days, it will conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review with third-party experts\u201d, publish a transparency report, and run penetration tests to find and fix further flaws.\nSuperunion\u2019s Vincent Roffers believes that is the right approach. \u201cThey need to make it right in a way that\u2019s transparent that\u2019s visible. The worst thing they could do is retreat and disappear,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be fine. The thing about branding is, you always have a lot of chances: It\u2019s not about what you do now, it\u2019s about what you do next.\u201d",

Fact-checking organisations often find that people are reluctant to change their mind once convinced of an issue if they are simply told they are wrong, despite international agencies finding there are no health risks associated with 5G and no link to coronavirus. There is also the risk that declining trust in mainstream media means that attempts to stop the claims spreading are seen as a cover-up.\nIn the case of Uckfield FM, Ofcom reported that the guest also used her appearance to launch a lengthy attack on health professionals in the NHS dealing with the pandemic.\nShe said: \u201cJust because you have this qualification, do not wear that like a crown of glory \u2026 The days are gone when you were a doctor and a nurse and everybody trusted you. Those days are well gone. Do your own research. Do not trust a qualification. I know many people who are very qualified who know very little. Because remember the people that own the establishments that teach us, it all travels back to the same thing. It\u2019s all owned by big pharma. They own the medical elite and they determine what gets published.\u201d\nOfcom decided that the 20-minute interview with a person purporting to be an authoritative health figure who was not sufficiently challenged posed a significant risk to public health at a time of national crisis. It ordered the station to broadcast an apology in a manner of regulator\u2019s choosing and warned other outlets that it would be stepping up monitoring.",

Another 1,300 will be set up at the two sites in Swansea Bay and 350 at a rugby stadium in Llanelli, south-west Wales. One 350-bed facility is being built in Llandudno, north Wales.\nGoodall said: \u201cWe expect the pressure on our healthcare system to be significant. We\u2019ve never taken such actions before and they are a necessary response to ensure that we care for our patients and for our communities.\u201d\nThe largest rise in Welsh confirmed cases announced on Thursday was again in the Aneurin Bevan University health board area, which covers the city of Newport and the Gwent valleys. It accounts for about a third of cases in Wales. The Cardiff and Vale area has recorded the second highest number of cases, followed by Swansea Bay.\nWelsh ministers believe the virus is tracking east to west and have suggested the proximity of Newport to the border with England is one of the reasons it has been so badly hit.\nDr Martin Bevan, the unit medical director at the Neath Port Talbot hospital, said it had increased the number of beds within the hospital as well as preparing to care for patients in the field hospitals.\nHe said: \u201cMainly it\u2019s been expansion of our bed capacity ready for the onslaught. It does seem to be progressing along the M4.\u201d\nA particular concern in Neath Port Talbot is that it serves a relatively old and frail population. \u201cOur age profile is higher, deprivation is higher, comorbidity is higher,\u201d said Bevan. \u201cEverything that could be worse is worse in the Neath Port Talbot area.\u201d\nAt the Llandarcy Academy of Sport in Neath, workers were laying a wooden floor over an indoor artificial pitch in an arena nicknamed The Barn that is used by the Ospreys professional rugby team for training. They were also installing a new heating system.\nTracy Myhill, the chief executive of Swansea Bay University health board, said she was proud of the effort by a string of partners to build the field hospital. \u201cThere is a real can-do attitude being demonstrated, and people are determined to do everything possible to safeguard our population,\u201d she said.\nNo field hospital is being built in the Aneurin Bevan University health board area. Instead, part of a new hospital in Cwmbran will be opened early to provide an extra 350 beds.\nAsked why no field hospitals were being created in the south-east, a Welsh government spokesperson said: \u201cAs well as its two acute hospitals, the health board is bringing forward the opening of the new \u00a3350m Grange University hospital, which will make an extra 350 beds available. We are making \u00a310m available to bring the new hospital online. Action is also under way to substantially increase capacity at other sites in the region.\u201d\nAnother problem the NHS in Wales faces is the number of staff off sick \u2013 currently running at about 10%, double the average for this time of year. NHS chiefs are ready to quickly move staff around to make sure they are where they are most needed.",

        "content": "Some racehorses familiar to British punters may be back in action next month in Japan, following the decision by Charlie Appleby to enter eight of his horses in races there. Japan is one of the few countries where horse racing continues behind closed doors during the coronavirus crisis, though that situation is not certain to last long enough for Appleby\u2019s horses to benefit and nor are they certain to be allowed to run in any case.\n A selection committee of Japan\u2019s ruling body is to meet on Friday to decide whether each of the Appleby entrants is sufficiently highly rated to be given a slot in the races, which range in status from Listed to Group One. But that ought to be a formality in the case of Magic Lily, runner-up in the top-class Jebel Hatta in Dubai last month, where she was beaten only by Barney Roy. Magic Lily, who was beaten less than a length in the 2017 Fillies\u2019 Mile at Newmarket, is entered for Tokyo\u2019s Victoria Mile on 17 May, a race that was worth \u00a3778,000 to the winner last year.\nWhile the reward is certainly there for Appleby and there is hardly anywhere else for him to race his horses, there is significant financial risk in transferring horses from Dubai to Japan for races that might not take place. The races concerned are open races, not invitationals, and no travel allowance is offered for overseas runners.\n \u201cThe virus situation appears to be getting worse in Japan,\u201d said a spokesman for the Japan Racing Association. \u201cIt was recently decided that racing could continue until 19 April but we cannot guarantee that races will be held in May. In a worst-case scenario, we might be forced to cancel the race-meetings after these horses arrive.\u201d\n Appleby\u2019s entrants also include Space Blues, a winner on Oaks day last year and beaten just a head in the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot. He is in the Keio Hai Spring Cup, a Group Two on 16 May. The other possible runners are Well Of Wisdom, Mubtasim, Glorious Journey, First Nation, Spotify and Mythical Magic. They are Godolphin-owned except for Glorious Journey, who has been racing in the maroon colours of Sheikha Al-Jalila, one of the children to Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya whose custody has been the subject of legal dispute.\n Meanwhile in Britain, Chester racecourse announced that it would not stage their high-profile May Festival next month. \u201cIt was clear that it would be impossible to draw upon the support required to run this event,\u201d said a statement that referred to government guidelines on dealing with the coronavirus as well as discussions with the local authority.\n \u201cWith our proximity to the city centre and public access around the perimeter of the racecourse, any racing behind closed doors was considered impossible within the current climate,\u201d the statement concluded.\n The British Horseracing Authority said it would not seek to stage jump racing before July, an acknowledgement of the additional danger posed by that branch of the sport at a time when the health service is under immense pressure. However, it promised to plan an enhanced jumps programme in late summer and early autumn to make up for the lost fixtures.\n \u201cTracks capable of holding jump racing in this period and most affected by the reduction in the number of jump fixtures earlier in the summer will be given priority when programming additional opportunities,\u201d a BHA statement said.\nMeanwhile, Irish racing bowed to the inevitable on Wednesday with an announcement that the five-day Punchestown Festival, which was due to open on 28 April, has been cancelled as a result of the lockdown to combat coronavirus. Neither Punchestown nor the Grand National Festival at Fairyhouse, which had been scheduled for its traditional slot on Easter weekend, will be rescheduled and as a result, the 2019-20 jumps season has now officially closed.\nIt could now be several months before another horse jumps a fence in public in Ireland, as Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), the sport\u2019s ruling body, also said on Wednesday that when the sport eventually resumes it will do so with a month of Flat-only fixtures, almost certainly behind closed doors.\nThe decision to draw a line under the 2019-20 season means that Willie Mullins, who had a narrow lead of just over \u20ac100,000 in the trainers\u2019 table, is Ireland\u2019s champion trainer for the 14th time, while Paul Townend, his stable jockey, is the Irish champion for the second year running.\n\u201cWhile the conclusion of the National Hunt season is a major blow for that sector and jump racing enthusiasts,\u201d Kavanagh said, \u201cin making an early decision we want to give as much certainty as possible to owners and trainers and this plan will allow winter National Hunt horses to take advantage of summer grass, reducing the costs for National Hunt owners, with the knowledge of an enhanced programme to come for them from the autumn onwards, circumstances permitting.\u201d",

        "content": "Updated advice says any healthcare worker coming within two metres of suspected case should wear protective equipment\nClinicians given the right to demand higher-specification personal protective equipment when dealing with coronavirus have warned that new guidance could count for little unless new supplies are made available.\nNew guidance, issued by the UK government, public health authorities and NHS England after criticism of previous guidelines, states that any clinician working in a hospital, primary care or community care setting within two metres of a suspected or confirmed coronavirus Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, surgical mask and eye protection \u201cbased on the risk\u201d.\nIt was updated after fears that the existing rules were confusing and some healthcare professionals were not being adequately protected from the risk of contracting the virus and passing it on to others.\nEmployers and unions broadly welcomed the new guidance, issued on Thursday, which doubles the distance at which PPE is required, but warned that it must be backed by adequate supplies.\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of council at the British Medical Association (BMA), said the doctors\u2019 union had heard concerns from physicians in more than 30 hospital trusts about shortages. \u201cWhat fundamentally matters is that doctors and healthcare workers get the adequate and appropriate supplies of PPE on the frontline,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout these supplies, there is continued unacceptable danger to the health and lives of healthcare workers and their patients.\u201d\nDoctors\u2019 Association UK agreed that adequate supplies were key and said the requirement for long-sleeve protective gowns should have been extended in place of \u201cflimsy plastic aprons\u201d.\nReports have been rife of shortages and large variations in the level of PPE available. Pictures of healthcare workers who have created their own makeshift protective equipment out of bin bags and other materials have proved embarrassing for the government and NHS leaders. Staff have also improvised masks out of snorkels, bought kit from hardware stores, and used school science goggles to protect themselves.\nLast week, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Prof Derek Alderson, urged members not to risk their health, following widespread reports of shortages. He said the new guidance was an improvement, but so long as shortages remained, \u201cmy warning still holds true\u201d.\nNiall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the guidance was straightforward for \u201cstaff to apply it to the clinical reality they face, whether they work in hospitals or the community. It means that if they think they need protective kit in a particular situation, they should be able to access it and wear it. But guidance is not the whole answer. Staff will need the right training and the right equipment, including for example \u2018fit test\u2019 kits to make sure the masks are effective. \n\u201cThere have been real problems with distribution, we have been assured they are being addressed, and to be fair, in many places that is happening. But any remaining supply chain problems need to be dealt with without delay.\u201d\nUnite, which represents 100,000 NHS staff, said increasing supplies was \u201ca national priority\u201d.\nThe government said the new guidance \u201creflects the fact that coronavirus is now widespread in the community, meaning clinicians are more likely to see patients with the virus, some of whom may have minimal or no symptoms\u201d and has the support of the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe previous guidance recommended PPE outside high-risk procedures when healthcare workers were within one metre of a patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. The new guidelines makes them consistent with the two-metre social distancing rule.\nProf Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: \u201cNHS England and the government are working hard to secure the supply lines in this challenging period so staff have the appropriate equipment.\u201d",

        "content": "Customers are all asking the same question of an industry in freefall. As one tour operator says, how firms respond will shape whether or not they have a future\nFor the past two weeks we\u2019ve addressed several questions in our Q&A but increasingly readers want to know the answer to just one: can I get a refund? We answered one specific query on this last week and my colleague Miles Brignall also outlined consumer rights in this piece. But as it keeps being raised, we thought it worth addressing again.\nUnder the Package Travel Regulations (PTR), you are entitled to a refund if your holiday provider cannot fulfil the holiday but \u2013 and it\u2019s a big but \u2013 tour operators are struggling to meet this legal obligation while facing a massive loss of income and, in some cases, repatriation costs.\nIn short, the travel industry is in freefall. It has weathered problems from natural disasters to terrorism to recession, but nothing comes close to the Covid-19 crisis, which is disastrous for countries and tourist destinations all over the world. A ludicrous, hypothetical scenario \u2013 what would happen if no one could travel? \u2013 is now a shocking and surreal reality.\nOf course, many sectors are on perilous ground, but the knock-on effects of this global paralysis are arguably worse for travel. The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) estimates that a million jobs are being lost every day in the travel and tourism sector because of the pandemic.\n\u201cFrom waiters to taxi drivers, tour guides to chefs and caterers, pilots to cleaners, the relentless cascade of job losses is plunging millions of families into terrible hardship and debt. The domino effect of Covid-19 is right now having a massive impact, wiping out an entire economic sector,\u201d said WTTC president and CEO Gloria Guevara.\nAs Brignall says, you should keep contacting your travel provider for a refund. If the government acts on calls from Abta for the refund window to be extended from 14 days to four months, you will wait longer for the money.\nBut tour operators are pleading with customers to postpone instead of cancelling, warning that mass cancellations will lead to a meltdown of the sector. Credit notes are protected in the same way as holidays and if the company does go under, the Atol scheme means you will be compensated.\nThe most responsible tour operators are being as flexible as possible. Much Better Adventures, for example, is offering refunds as an option but incentivising customers to postpone by offering a 5% discount (for life) on future trips. So far it has worked: 80% of customers have opted to postpone instead of cancel. There will be no increase in the cost of trips for 2021, and no expiry date for credit notes. Co-founder Sam Bruce admitted that small companies can be more adaptable but he\u2019s also critical of companies that are refusing refunds. \u201cLots of companies in our position aren\u2019t being as flexible.\u201d\nHe also said he doesn\u2019t support Abta\u2019s call for changes to the PTR rules and believes there is \u201ca lot of love being lost between the travel industry and consumers. If customers bought under those terms, they should be honoured.\u201d\nFor some tour operators that is simply not possible. They are being asked to give full refunds for air-inclusive holidays, often without being able to recoup money from airlines \u2013 leaving tour operators out of pocket. \u201cUntil governments step up, and bring the airlines to heel, the consumer has to rely on the quit wits and sympathy of small tour operators,\u201d said Douglas Durrant of Caribbean Fun Travel.\nAs Bruce sees it, this is a test of loyalty \u2013 those companies that work with customers during this challenging time will be the ones that benefit in the long term.\n\u201cThere are a lot of travel companies making rash decisions, and they may not come out of this looking too rosy at the end. This is about treating customers well so the terms know who to trust when this passes.\u201d\nThat is small comfort if you are trying to get money back right now, but worth bearing in mind when you come to book a future holiday.",

        "content": "Health officials appear to be coming around to masks for the general public. We asked four experts for their advice\nFor several weeks, health professionals, political leaders and even the World Health Organization have told the public that people do not need to use protective face masks unless they are sick or caring for someone with Covid-19.\nExperts agree that medical-grade protective gear, such as N95 respirators, should be reserved for health workers, but officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US said on Monday they were reviewing their recommendations after new data showed nearly a quarter of those infected did not show symptoms, meaning they were infectious perhaps without realizing it.\nSome countries, such as Austria, have made mask-wearing in supermarkets compulsory. Local leaders in the United States have begun encouraging \u2013 and in some cases mandating \u2013 that people cover their faces in public. We asked four experts for their advice.\nJeremy Howard The primary transmission [of coronavirus] is now known to be droplet-based, and we now know that that transmission largely occurs in the first seven days after infection, when people are largely asymptomatic. So that means that if you\u2019re highly infectious, you probably won\u2019t know it. So we should all assume that we are potentially lethal to people around us. The way we are potentially lethal to people around us is when we speak: that\u2019s when these micro droplets get ejected up to six feet.\nIf you\u2019re speaking, and you put a couple of layers of cotton or paper towel in front of your mouth, the droplets go into that and not into the face of the person you\u2019re speaking to. That\u2019s why masks dramatically help reduce the spread of the virus.\nJessica Justman It\u2019s like a pitcher and a catcher at a baseball game. And the masks are all about trying to keep the pitcher from pitching the ball. There are more pitchers than we realized, and if we need to all wear masks in order to keep the pitchers from pitching their balls, then so be it.\nHoward There is some extra protection for the wearer, but it is imperfect. It\u2019s good to think about wearing a mask as protecting your community and asking your community to do the same for you.\nHoward They were trying to protect frontline healthcare workers from running out of N95 respirators.\nBen Cowling If the WHO were to consider modifying their current recommendations, they might go in the direction of saying: \u201cSave the surgical masks for the healthcare settings, and let\u2019s look into using homemade masks and cloth masks in the community to reduce transmission.\u201d\nSaskia Popescu I worry about someone who is sick wearing a mask, but then touching their mouth underneath, not washing their hands, and touching surfaces. I worry about the false sense of security, about people not wearing them appropriately, or cleaning them appropriately. So there are a lot of other pieces to [stopping transmission] that extend beyond the mask.\nOf course, we want sick people to be wearing the mask, but if you tell everyone to go wear a mask right now, I think that could put a run on supplies.\nHoward When we found that seatbelts keep people safe, we required people wear them. When we realized that condoms can protect you from disease, we told people to avoid unprotected sex. If there\u2019s something that could dramatically slash the transmission of disease, and our response is to tell people not to use it because they might do it wrong, that\u2019s incompatible with any other kind of policy decisions we make.\nHoward Cambridge University has shown that a couple of layers of cotton, like a T-shirt, would work great. A Shenzhen hospital scientist showed a couple of layers of paper towel worked great. We have a DIY recipe on our site that actually shows a combination of those two things requiring no tools other than a pair of scissors.\nCowling Cover the mouth, the nose, and the chin. Don\u2019t touch the front of the mask because it might be contaminated.\nHoward: No, not at all. A seal is something you need for aerosol-generating procedures. So unless you\u2019re planning on intubating patients at your own home or during your shopping trip, that\u2019s not an issue. Remember, the main thing we\u2019re doing is protecting those around you.\nHoward: We absolutely can\u2019t. There are four measures \u2013 rigorous testing, contact tracing, quarantine of potentially infected persons and universal mask-wearing \u2013 that represent a known good recipe. We don\u2019t know exactly which combination of those things works and how important each one is. We\u2019ve just got to do what works.\nBen Cowling is a professor of epidemiology and co-director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of Hong Kong\nJessica Justman is a professor and attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center\nJeremy Howard is a distinguished research scientist at the University of San Francisco and founder of the #Masks4All campaign\nSaskia Popescu is a Phoenix-based epidemiologist",

        "content": "Women are leading a volunteer effort to care for elders and vulnerable people across the tribe\u2019s vast, poorly served territory\nIn mid-March, shortly after the Navajo Nation declared a public health state of emergency, Ethel Branch went out to stock up on supplies for her elderly mother and nieces who live on the Native American reservation.\nBranch, who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent all day going from store to store trying to find canned soups, soap and toilet paper. Many had sold out, while others were price gouging amid rising panic about the coronavirus pandemic.\nBranch started calling friends looking for ideas about how to ensure the tribe\u2019s most vulnerable families got enough food, water and hygiene supplies without risking their lives by traveling long distances.\nIt was not easy. The Navajo Nation is the second-biggest tribal group in the US, with 332,000 people, according to the last census. But unemployment on the reservation hovers around 50% and it is also a food desert with only 13 grocery stores for 180,000 people. One in three people do not have running water or electricity.\n\u201cI\u2019d been monitoring developments [in Asia] since January, and knew when it hit us, it would be really bad so we had to get prepared,\u201d said Branch, 40, who served as the Nation\u2019s attorney general between 2015 and 2019.\nWith these harsh realities in mind, Branch and her friends created the Navajo & Hopi Families Covid-19 Relief Fund, and started a GoFundMe page.\nBy Thursday, $267,000 had been donated and a small army of volunteers was coordinating a full-scale emergency response to distribute crucial supplies to needy families across the vast Navajo territory and the neighboring Hopi reservation, where three small convenience stores serve almost 3,000 people.\nSo far, more than 2,000 households have registered for help \u2013 some online but most by calling a call center volunteer who asks them about how much food they have left, allergies and medical needs, in order to prioritize orders.\nHundreds of care packages \u2013 containing core items such as flour, beans, rice, canned soups, dried meat, fever and cough medicine, as well as fresh vegetables, fruit and meat when available, have been delivered to elders caring for grandchildren and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty went to Chilchinbeto, a close-knit community of 500 people which has been locked down since the first localized spread was detected.\nThe volunteer effort is an example of what the Navajo call T\u2019\u00e1\u00e1 hw\u00f3 aj\u00edt\u2019\u00e9ego, or self-reliance and self-determination.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fixed model, we do what needs to be done, to get supplies where they are needed as fast and safely as possible through our network,\u201d Branch told the Guardian.\nThe volunteer \u2013 and government \u2013 efforts are a mammoth task given the size and geography of the Nation which stretches 27,000 square miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The territory, which is roughly the size of West Virginia, includes arid deserts and alpine forests with high plateaus, mesas and mountains reaching over 10,000ft in altitude.\nIn addition to economic and topographic challenges, the coronavirus pandemic represents particular risks to the Navajo \u2013 and other tribal nations \u2013 as rates of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and diabetes are comparatively higher than in the non-Native populations, while tribal health services have been underfunded for decades.\nAmid growing concern, the Navajo government issued a shelter-in-place order on 21 March \u2013 two days after California \u2013 shutting down all non-essential government services and businesses.\n\u201cThe order is to make sure we flatten the curve as soon as possible, and that means getting supplies to our most vulnerable residents and shelters so people stay home, and stay safe,\u201d said tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. \u201cWater is now our number one priority.\u201d\nEven before this crisis, access to water on the Navajo reservation was incredibly complicated. At least 30% must rely on unregulated wells and springs \u2013 which can be unsafe as many groundwater sources are contaminated by some 523 abandoned uranium mines \u2013 or travel up to 40 miles to replenish tanks and buy bottled water to meet basic needs like drinking, cooking and bathing.\nThe limited access to clean, running water made following coronavirus prevention guidelines such as frequent hand-washing challenging. Now, many government water distribution points have closed, while others have cut their hours to comply with the stay-at-home order.\nFinding a reliable bulk water supplier is a priority for Branch\u2019s group as local stores and distributors expect shortages over coming weeks.\nThe Navajo women driving this grassroots relief effort bring a range of business, public service and organizing experience, and include the owner of a home care company, a director of a not-for-profit small business incubator, and head of the department of corrections.\nThese skills and contacts enabled them to make deals with wholesalers, and set up distribution points where volunteers sanitize items before trucking them to households in far-flung communities like Tuba City, Black Mesa and Hopi. The baskets are left on the doorstep, to minimize unnecessary physical contact.\nSo far, 214 Covid-19 cases including seven deaths had been confirmed on the Nation.\n\u201cIt warms the heart,\u201d said longstanding tribal council delegate Daniel Tso. \u201cIt brings tears to my eyes to see people organizing and risking their own health to protect the elderly and vulnerable children, it really shows the strength of the Navajo people.\u201d",

We are talking about \u20ac100bn of loans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an enormous amount of money \u2026This is a massive support of the European Union that is laid forward here.\u201d\nVon der Leyen said the scheme, called Sure, was an example of \u201cEuropean solidarity in action\u201d, following criticism of a lack of support by EU member states for those most affected by the spread of Covid-19, including Italy and Spain.\nIn an article published in the Italian newspaper, La Repubblica, on Thursday, Von der Leyen had sought to assuage some of the anger at the EU\u2019s stumbling performance.\n\u201cI apologise, we are with you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cToday, Europe is mobilising alongside Italy. But that has not always been the case. It must be recognised that at the start of the crisis, faced with the need for a common European response, far too many thought only of their national problems.\u201d\nVon der Leyen has been under pressure to offer evidence that Brussels has the tools to help in the crisis after governments clashed over the ill-fated idea of coronabonds, an instrument to allow member states to raise cash on the financial markets on the same terms.\nGermany and the Netherlands were among those resistant to the idea, which would make borrowing more expensive for the wealthier EU member states.\nVon der Leyen said that finance ministers would examine the commission\u2019s job retention plan next Tuesday. The Sure programme will only come into effect once all member states have put up guarantees collectively worth \u20ac25bn.\nCountries will apply for loans from Brussels when they are \u201cseriously threatened with a severe economic disturbance\u201d. The need for the fund will be reviewed after 12 months.\nThe UK will not participate in the scheme as the withdrawal agreement rules out any further budgetary liabilities for the British government.",

        "content": "Fossil shows the first of our ancestors existed up to 200,000 years earlier than previously thought, researchers say\nThe earliest known skull of Homo erectus has been unearthed by an Australian-led team of researchers who have dated the fossil at two million years old, showing the first of our ancestors existed up to 200,000 years earlier than previously thought.\nThe lead researcher Prof Andy Herries said the skull was pieced together from more than 150 fragments uncovered at the Drimolen Main Quarry, located about 40km north of Johannesburg in South Africa. It was likely aged between two and three years old when it died.\nHerries, a geochronologist and head of archaeology at Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University, said he \u201ccould not stress how rare it is\u201d to find find enough fragments to piece together an intact brain case, especially given juvenile skulls are thin and fragile.\n\u201cAt this age they are so susceptible to damage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting, because our fascination with human evolution is because it\u2019s the story of us, and when we go back this far with a discovery like this, it\u2019s the story of every person living on the planet.\n\u201cThe group this two or three-year-old was a part of could have been the origin of everyone alive today.\u201d\nHe said while there was a lot of disagreement of opinion in the field of archaeology and human evolution, one of the reasons Homo erectus is significant is because everyone agreed: \u201cThis is the beginning of us, this is the beginning of our genus.\u201d\nHerries said it was one of his PhD students working with him at the excavation site, Richard Curtis, who found the fragments in 2015 during his first excavation. Curtis originally thought he had discovered the skull pieces of a baboon.\n\u201cI was working a bit further up the hill and you know when someone has found something because a big shout goes up the hill, people come up to you with wide eyes, some of my colleagues start dancing,\u201d Herries said.\n\u201cBut still, we find a lot of baboons, and that\u2019s what we thought we\u2019d probably found in this case. So it wasn\u2019t until we cleaned the fragments off and my colleagues at the University of Johannesburg started working to put them back together that it was obvious the skull was way too big and round to be a baboon.\u201d It took them five years to reconstruct, date and identify the skull.\n\u201cIt might seem weird that we can\u2019t tell what is a baboon and what isn\u2019t straight away, but it\u2019s difficult when you have a lot of fragments,\u201d Herries said.\nOne piece of the skull had actually been uncovered by archaeologists in 2007, but because the fragment was found on its own and was very thin, the researchers did not recognise they had found the skull of a hominin. The fragment was placed in a bag, and sat in a vault for about a decade until Herries\u2019 team realised it was a piece of their skull, which they named DMH 134.\n\u201cWe can now say Homo erectus shared the landscape with two other types of humans in South Africa, Paranthropus and Australopithecus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests that one of these other human species, Australopithecus sediba, may not have been the direct ancestor of Homo erectus, or us, as previously hypothesised.\u201d\nHerries said the finding was particularly special because in 1924 the Australian anatomist Raymond Dart identified the the first fossil ever found of Australopithecus africanus, an extinct hominin closely related to humans and discovered in South Africa.\n\u201cNobody believed him at the time because they thought the origin of humans would be in Europe,\u201d Herries said. \u201cAnd now, 100 years later, DMH 134 will go sit in the same room as that child he identified, further proving what he found. It\u2019s a testament to the work of Australians on human evolution.\u201d\nThe findings were published on Friday in the international journal Science.\nThe archaeologist Dr Ceri Shipton from the Australian National University was not involved in the research but examined the findings, which he said made a good case for Homo erectus and several more species of hominin and other animals emerging at a time of a drying climate 2.3-2 million years ago.\n\u201cThis fits with the idea of our genus being adapted to the savannah and in particular exploiting the big game that is available on grasslands, which they would then butcher using stone tools,\u201d Shipton said.\n\u201cThis find is a long way from the previous earliest Homo erectus in east Africa, confirming Homo erectus was wide ranging from the outset, which is why their early fossils have also been found in Georgia about 1.8 million years ago, and that they likely reached the island of Flores where they became isolated and evolved into Homo floresiensis.\u201d\nThe geochronologist and quaternary scientist with Macquarie University, Associate Prof Kira Westaway, said recent research into human evolution is increasingly uncovering overlaps between different hominids thought to be separated spatially and temporally.\n\u201cThese well dated overlaps indicate that the hominid family tree is much more diverse and complex than previously accepted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most fascinating implication from this research, fuelled by the confirmation of an overlap, is that the cause of Australopithecus extinction can be explored with the new potential that there may have been competition from Homo or Paranthropus \u2013 this truly is a new and exciting avenue of research.\u201d",

        "content": "Findings offer researchers new ways to measure intensity of emotional responses \nWhether it is screwing up your face when sucking a lemon, or smiling while sitting in the sun, humans have a range of facial expressions that reflect how they feel. Now, researchers say, they have found mice do too.\n\u201cMice exhibit facial expressions that are specific to the underlying emotions,\u201d said Dr Nadine Gogolla, co-author of the research from Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. She said the findings were important, as they offer researchers new ways to measure the intensity of emotional responses, which could help them probe how emotions arise in the brain.\nWhat\u2019s more, she said, the findings show mice have a repertoire of emotions.\nWriting in the journal Science, Gogolla and colleagues report that they exposed mice to a mixture of triggers. These included electric shocks to the tail, sweet treats, and lithium chloride injections, which induced a state akin to nausea.\nWhile the authors say the facial movements that followed were noticeable, anyone hoping for a comical murine grimace may be disappointed.\nIndeed, rather like Ben Stiller\u2019s Zoolander, the expressions appear very similar to the human eye \u2013 albeit with subtle differences. For example, compared with a neutral expression, a mouse\u2019s ears lay further back and the position of its lower jaw and nose shifted when it had its tail zapped.\nTo probe these expressions further, the team turned to computer vision technology that extracts features from different images, and quantifies differences between pictures.\nThe software revealed clear differences between images of mice taken from before and after each trigger was applied, as well as differences between images captured during different types of trigger, suggesting the facial expression linked to a zapped tail was different to that manifested when a treat was given.\nFurther work using average facial feature data relating to each trigger confirmed this, something the team say shows that the expressions reflect different emotional states, such as pleasure, disgust, nausea and pain \u2013 although fear linked to escape had a less distinct expression.\nThe team also employed machine learning \u2013 a type of artificial intelligence that can recognise patterns and hence sort data into different groups.\nThe system was first fed with facial expressions from the mice, labelled with the corresponding emotion. When it was subsequently presented with unlabelled facial images, it predicted the emotions captured within them with more than 90% accuracy. \u201c[The expressions] are very similar between mice,\u201d said Gogolla.\nThe team found that expressions could vary in duration and onset. while Mice pulled a stronger expression, relative to the average, when they were given a sweet sucrose drink when thirsty compared with when they were quenched. \u201cIt is not just a sucrose face we are eliciting,\u201d said Gogolla. \u201cThe pleasure is higher when you are actually thirsty.\u201d\nIn a further twist, the team looked at brain regions previously associated with emotions in animals including mice, finding that if they stimulated areas linked to particular emotions, the mouse pulled the expected corresponding face. Again, machine learning could tell these apart.\nIn their accompanying commentary, Dr Benoit Girard and Prof Camilla Bellone of the University of Geneva say the new research could not only open up new ways to probe how emotions arise in the brain, but could also help researchers explore whether animals share information through their facial expressions, and how and why experiences of emotions may differ between individuals.\nBut Dr Susanne Schweizer, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work, said it was unclear whether the facial expressions of the mice truly reflected emotions, since they relate to short-lived physical experiences.\n\u201cHow do these experiences \u2013 if at all \u2013 relate to the emotional pain experienced when we are faced with loss, the pleasure we experience when we see a loved one succeed, or the sense of disgust we are overcome with when we hear about a moral transgression?\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be fascinating to see if the effects can be reliably replicated in response to social stressors and positive social stimuli in mice.\u201d",

        "content": "Health secretary \u2018determined\u2019 to reach six-figure goal for England by end of April\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, has set the government a new target of carrying out 100,000 Covid-19 tests a day in England by the end of April as he sought to defend the government\u2019s approach.\nAfter several days of intense scrutiny over failures in testing, including the prioritisation of the public over doctors and nurses, Hancock said he was setting out a new \u201cfive-pillar\u201d strategy.\nHe said England would hit 100,000 tests a day, which would include antigen tests that show whether people are currently suffering from Covid-19, as well as antibody tests to see whether people have had the infection and recovered.\nSpeaking at the end of his seven days of quarantine after testing positive for the virus, he said: \u201cI\u2019m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I\u2019m determined we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, there was capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England, although just over 10,650 people were tested. The government\u2019s target by mid-April had been to test 25,000 a day.\nHancock said it was his decision to prioritise testing of patients over NHS staff, and added that he thought any health secretary would have done the same.\n\u201cI understand why NHS staff want tests, so they can get back to the frontline, of course I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I took the decision that the first priority has to be the patients for whom the results of a test could be the difference in treatment that is the difference between life and death.\n\u201cI believe anybody in my shoes would have taken the same decision.\u201d\nHis announcement came at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, where he announced that more than \u00a313bn of historical debt owed by hospital trusts would be written off to place the National Health Service in a \u201cstronger position\u201d to respond to the crisis.\nThe health secretary said he had also made \u00a3300m available for community pharmacies and that he wanted to make sure \u201cevery part\u201d of the health and care system was supported.\n\u201cToday, to help NHS trusts to deliver what\u2019s needed without worrying about past finances, I can announce that I\u2019m writing off \u00a313.4bn of historic NHS debt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis landmark step will not only put the NHS in a stronger position to be able to respond to this global coronavirus pandemic, but it will ensure that our NHS has stronger foundations for the future too.\u201d\nIn an unusually detailed press conference following several days of criticism of the government\u2019s strategy, Hancock also attempted to confront claims that the UK is lagging behind the responses to the disease in other European countries such as Germany.\nHancock said he was going to \u201clevel with you\u201d on the challenges the UK faced and the government\u2019s plan to increase testing significantly.\nThe UK had not gone into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry, as Germany had, he said, and so had been \u201ccatching up\u201d.\nDemand for materials had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents, Hancock said. The swabs issue has been fixed but \u201cwe are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge\u201d, he said.\nIn what appeared to be a first acknowledgement from the government that mistakes had been made, he added: \u201cThere will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.\u201d\nHancock said there was a \u201cchallenge\u201d in ensuring the public could have confidence in the tests being used on NHS staff. He added that a number of testing methods being analysed had failed to positively diagnose a coronavirus patient.\n\u201cIn one case a test that I\u2019m being urged to buy missed three out of four positive cases for coronavirus.\n\u201cThat means that three-quarters of cases, that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don\u2019t work is dangerous and I will not do it,\u201d he said.\nHancock paid an emotional tribute to NHS staff who had lost their lives, and expressed his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the friends and families of all coronavirus victims.\n\u201cIf the past few weeks have shown us anything, it\u2019s that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer,\u201d he said.\nHe went on to acknowledge that most of the NHS staff who had died had been migrants to the UK.\n\u201cI am profoundly moved by the compassion and the commitment that we are seeing from people right across the country, and in the health and care system we have lost colleagues too.\n\u201cMany of those who have died who are from the NHS were people who came to this country to make a difference, and they did, and they\u2019ve given their lives in sacrifice, and we salute them,\u201d he said.\nHancock said he had come back from self-isolation on Thursday \u201credoubled in my determination to fight this virus with everything I\u2019ve got\u201d.",

The mayor of Los Angeles also told everyone in the city to start wearing masks on Wednesday.\nUS cases of the virus have exceeded 215,000 and the death toll is approaching 5,000.\nCuomo noted the state released 400 ventilators to New York City on Wednesday night and would distribute ventilators based on need in the weeks to come.\nThe state has 2,200 in its stockpile and Cuomo said 350 people severely afflicted by the virus are coming into hospitals every night needing such breathing assistance.\nThe state has also seen 2,373 deaths linked to the virus, up from 1,941 yesterday. New York accounts for nearly half of the coronavirus deaths from the entire country.\nGlobal deaths confirmed from coronavirus exceeded 50,000 for the first time on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University, while global cases were approaching 1 million.\nCuomo said the number of people discharged from the hospital is \u201cway up\u201d, marking some rare good news since cases started to surge.\nBut Cuomo warned the state still needs more hospital beds to prepare for the peak of the crisis. The state is constructing temporary hospitals at places such as the Javits center and Brooklyn cruise terminal to add beds for coronavirus patients.\nThe governor said he was more concerned about ensuring the state has enough medical professionals and equipment to deal with the peak of the crisis. \u201cBeds we can find,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe harder component is the staff and the supplies.\u201d\nCuomo added that it was the \u201ccruelest irony\u201d that the country was now dependent on China for the production of crucial medical equipment.\nThe governor implored businesses to pivot to producing medical equipment like gowns. \u201cWe will pay a premium,\u201d Cuomo assured business owners.\nThe retired New York police department commissioner James O\u2019Neill is returning to help the city administration as a senior adviser overseeing distribution of essential medical equipment to hospitals throughout the city of 8.4 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of all New Yorkers to do their part,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cI always felt that way and I continue to feel that way.\u201d\nTens of thousands of retired medical workers have come forward to help New York and extra help is arriving from far and wide, including from the federal government after weeks of a mix of angry and desperate pleas from New York leaders.\n\n \u201cThe cavalry keeps coming,\u201d the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, said on Thursday as 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs and paramedics arrived from around the country, based on reinforcements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).\nIn a video on Thursday morning, De Blasio told the story of two men from Kalamazoo, Michigan, who drove their ambulance all the way to New York City to be of service.\nThere are heroes among us!@NYCMayor visited Fort Totten in Bayside to thank New York City\u2019s courageous EMTs and paramedics \u2014 and welcome some much needed reinforcements. From Kalamazoo to Florida, ambulances and EMS workers are arriving to support our teams and save lives. pic.twitter.com/8yAWUZpj9m\nThis surge in federal aid comes even as De Blasio warns the city is still lacking 3.3m N95 masks, 2.1m surgeon masks and 100,000 isolation gowns for a Sunday deadline, numbers he called big but reachable.\nData released late on Wednesday by city health officials shows that residents in the immigrant-rich Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona sections of the New York City borough of Queens have tested positive for the virus in far greater numbers and at higher rates per capita than in wealthy, mostly white parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn.\nPeople living in one Queens zip code just south of LaGuardia airport were roughly four times as likely to have tested positive as people in the gentrified section of Brooklyn that De Blasio calls home.\nThe numbers back something that has, for days, seemed obvious at Elmhurst hospital, the only major medical center serving that part of Queens where infections are most prevalent.\nLong lines of people waiting for testing and treatment outside the hospital have been one of the defining images of the pandemic, as have stories of multiple deaths in Elmhurst\u2019s overburdened wards.\nAsked about the disparities, Mitchell Katz, chief executive of the city-run hospital system, said crowded housing could be playing a role.\n\u201cWe know that in Queens, many families, because of poverty, live together in very close quarters. So that while we are practicing as a city social distancing, you may have multiple families living together in a very small apartment. And so it\u2019s easy to understand why there\u2019s a lot of transmission of Covid-19 occurring,\u201d he said.",

However, on Thursday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, signalled a shift in approach that will see a new target of 100,000 tests each day relying on a network of companies, universities and research institutes.\nProf Eleanor Riley, an infectious disease expert at the University of Edinburgh and former director of the Roslin Institute, said these resources could have been tapped into far earlier and, in some cases, laboratories\u2019 offers were not taken up. \u201cThis could\u2019ve happened a month ago,\u201d she said. \u201cPHE has been plugging on in its very blinkered way and meanwhile there\u2019s a revolution going on on the shop floor. It\u2019s like hospitals have decided, \u2018We\u2019re just going to go ahead and do it.\u2019\u201d\nAhead of Hancock\u2019s briefing, Sir Paul Nurse, director of the Crick Institute, said in the past 10 days a cancer genetics laboratory at the Crick had been transformed into a high-throughput testing lab. It will carry out 500 tests for healthcare workers from Monday, ramping up to 2,000 within a couple of weeks in what he described as the \u201cDunkirk approach\u201d.\n\u201cWe made a deliberate policy choice \u2026 to go ahead with this and to divert resources from research,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the little boats \u2013 well, moderate-sized boats. Once we get the destroyers in there to pick people up, it\u2019ll be a game-changer, but until then institutes like ours can have a huge impact on the national endeavour.\u201d\nHowever, many universities have opted to close labs, on the assumption that decentralised efforts were not required, in order to protect staff.\nProf Matthew Freeman, head of the Dunn school of pathology in Oxford, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a policy question and the government has to take responsibility for that. Either they decide they don\u2019t want a cottage industry doing this and they want it all centralised, or you talk about Dunkirk. If the view is that this decentralised approach can be helpful, the offers have been there for weeks.\u201d\nAfter offering to redeploy his lab, equipment and scientists to Covid testing weeks ago and not hearing back, Freeman said he felt some frustration at seeing efforts going ahead elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m slightly regretting [not setting things up] after seeing that the Crick has gone ahead and done it,\u201d he said, adding that the offer stood.\nIn Thursday\u2019s briefing, Hancock laid out a new five-pillar strategy for testing, which included a partnership with universities, research institutions and companies such as Amazon and Boots to build a network of new labs to provide swab testing for frontline health workers and their families. Trials at five unnamed sites had been completed, he said.\nIn advance of this, several major research institutes had started ramping up testing capabilities without this being an explicit part of the government\u2019s approach.\nCancer Research UK is replicating the Crick\u2019s setup at three major research institutes in Glasgow, Manchester and Cambridge, and anticipates that the sites will be running roughly 6,000 per day in total within seven to 14 days.\nIn Edinburgh, the Medical Research Council\u2019s (MRC) Human Genetics Laboratory has shipped in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines from across the university campus and by the middle of next week expects to be running 1,000 tests per day. King\u2019s College London and the universities of Dundee and Aberdeen have also repurposed labs and are expected to have a similar capacity.\n\u201cIn an ideal world, we would\u2019ve had more testing capacity online earlier,\u201d said Sir Professor Robert Lechler, senior vice-president of King\u2019s College London. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to point the finger of blame. It\u2019s remarkable that we\u2019ve moved at the pace we have and the upheaval that this new world has caused is difficult to exaggerate.\u201d\nProf Wendy Bickmore, director of the MRC human genetics unit at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cThis is very much a bottom-up local initiative with local NHS labs. It was recognising there\u2019s an immediate need in the NHS and that we can help meet that.\u201d\nOther large labs that could have been capable of similar efforts, but which did not have close ties with NHS testing facilities, might have been encouraged to do the same, she said. \u201cWe can probably look back on this from a happier future and see how we might be more ready next time to harness the capabilities that are out there.\u201d\nAddenbrooke\u2019s hospital has become the first in the UK to use a new, rapid Covid-19 test for staff and patients, called Samba Two, that delivers results in 90 minutes. The hospital has installed four machines in the triage area and is running parallel tests on patient samples for the next three days, after which it plans to install a further 16 Samba machines, which should cover the hospital\u2019s entire requirements for patient and staff testing without needing to rely on PHE labs.\nSeparately, Cambridge University labs will start running tests for healthcare workers in the region, and the scientists expect to be conducting 600 tests per week soon.\nSome experts expressed concerns that not all cities or regions had large universities or research facilities that could contribute to local testing capacity, meaning regional disparities could emerge, particularly in tests on healthcare workers.\n\u201cThere is definitely a potential for inequality,\u201d said Prof Ravi Gupta, who is leading the assessment of the Samba testing at Cambridge. \u201cThat\u2019s where government testing should be directed \u2013 that needs to be factored in.\u201d",

It also mandates jail time for intentionally spreading disinformation that hampers the coronavirus response, measures that were roundly criticised by the opposition at home and politicians abroad.\nThe gender regulation, part of a larger bill on a number of issues not related to coronavirus, will still be considered by parliament in the normal way.\nIt shows that even as Orb\u00e1n requested special measures for fighting coronavirus, his government had not forgotten its other battles. Trans rights and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d are frequent bugbears of alt-right and conservative politicians, and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has previously introduced a measure that in effect banned universities from teaching gender studies.\nTrans people have had trouble legally changing their documents since 2018, Reuters reported, a situation that is currently subject to several legal challenges. The proposed bill would enshrine this denial of changes in law.\nThe Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovi\u0107, called on Hungary\u2019s parliament not to adopt the law, and said the measure was in contravention of human rights standards and the case law of the European court of human rights.\n\u201cTransgender persons have the right to legal recognition of their gender based on self-determination. This is an essential step to ensure respect for their human rights in all areas of life. Legal gender recognition is a matter of human dignity,\u201d she said in a statement on Thursday.\nAt home, human rights activists also criticised the bill. \u201cIt is appalling that the government plans to ban legal gender recognition in the shadow of the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Tam\u00e1s Dombos, a board member of the Hungarian LGBT Alliance, told Agence France-Presse.\n\u201cSuch a measure would force trans people to live with documents that do not match their true identity and their appearance ... That exposes them to potential discrimination in employment, housing, access to goods and services, and official procedures,\u201d he said.",

He believes he was infected during a business meeting with a contact who had been to the festival and also subsequently tested positive for the virus.\n\u201cI would say that Cheltenham should have erred on the side of caution,\u201d his relative said. \u201cI think they should have made their own decision and not be passing the buck.\n\u201cI understand that they were acting in accordance with government advice at the time. However, the government was subsequently criticised as well for not acting quickly enough on this. I think we\u2019re seeing the effects in this lockdown of not acting quickly enough and what could be possible by taking stricter measures such as we are at the moment. That\u2019s potentially going to have an effect on the number of new cases already.\u201d\nThe Festival\u2019s organisers said the meeting, and several other high-profile sporting events the same week, went ahead following extensive consultation. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe Festival concluded three weeks ago and went ahead under the clear and ongoing guidance from the government and its science experts throughout, like other popular sports events at Twickenham [and] Murrayfield, 10 Premier League matches and the Uefa Champions League [between Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid] at Anfield that same week.\n\u201cWe promoted the latest public health advice and introduced a range of additional hygiene measures at the event, including hundreds of hand sanitiser dispensers and extra wash basins.\u201d\nSue Smith, the senior racecourse medical officer at Cheltenham, said on Thursday that \u201cit\u2019s simply not possible to know how and where someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 has contracted it\u201d. Smith added: \u201cThe standards of hand wash and hygiene at the Festival were of the highest level and all measures were taken in accordance with daily updates from Public Health England.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said on Thursday that Cheltenham\u2019s decision accorded with the measures in place on 10 March.\n\u201cIt is our absolute priority to protect people\u2019s health, and our advice on coronavirus is the result of direct, continuous consultation with medical experts,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cCheltenham Festival was operating within clear Public Health England guidance at the time.\u201d\nThe decision to hold Liverpool\u2019s game with Atl\u00e9tico at Anfield has been heavily criticised, particularly because Madrid was by then known to be a centre for the virus in Spain. And Cheltenham\u2019s decision to go ahead \u2013 and the decision of 20,000 Irish people to travel over for the festival \u2013 triggered widespread anger and disbelief in Ireland last month.\n\u201cIf Cheltenham was being held in Ireland I don\u2019t think it would be on, quite frankly,\u201d Simon Coveney, the foreign minister and t\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister), told RT\u00c9\u2019s flagship news show, Prime Time.\nMedia commentators and social media users went further and condemned as irresponsible those who at the start of the coronavirus outbreak trooped on to planes, ferries and trains and packed stands and pubs in the Cotswolds before returning home to potentially spread coronavirus.\n\u201cDamned if this timeless paradise of horse-iness is going to be thrown off course by some poxy little global pandemic,\u201d said the Irish Times.\nHowever, to date there has been just one case linked to the Festival \u2013 a man diagnosed with Covid-19 two weeks after he returned to Ireland. He has not been named and it is unclear where he became infected.",

        "content": "Communication Workers Union estimates half of sorting offices have insufficient PPE and sanitiser\nMany Royal Mail sorting offices are not providing workers with sufficient protection from coronavirus infection, according to a trade union, which argues that some depots should close until staff are safe.\nThe Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents thousands of postal workers, told members they should stay away if their local sorting office had not provided equipment such as masks, gloves and hand sanitiser, or implemented government guidelines of two-metre social distancing at all times. It estimates that at as many as half of sorting offices did not have sufficient protection in place.\nDave Ward, CWU general secretary, said: \u201cThe conditions thousands of our members are being expected to work in are not safe. Provision of PPE [personal protective equipment] across the UK is sporadic and Royal Mail have admitted they have no data on what equipment is available in each office.\n\u201cOur members are fantastic public servants. They want to keep the UK connected and are willing to step up their role by checking on the elderly, delivering government services and assisting with food deliveries. They deserve better than to be told washing their hands is the \u2018gold standard\u2019 of safety.\u201d\nRoyal Mail has disputed the union\u2019s claims, saying it had provided hand soap for workers to clean their hands and that latex gloves were available for those who wanted them. It said that \u201cwherever possible\u201d workers were being kept least two metres apart in depots.\nA spokesman said: \u201cRoyal Mail takes the health and safety of our colleagues very seriously. Throughout this crisis, every decision we make puts the health of our people and our customers first. In assessing the risks to our people and making the necessary operational changes to protect them, we take professional medical and health and safety advice on a daily basis.\u201d\nRoyal Mail added that under new measures to protect postal workers on the doorstep, customers were not being passed handheld devices to sign for parcels, instead logging their name from a safe distance. From last week the company said only one person at a time was allowed in a delivery vehicle and junk mail was now only delivered alongside addressed mail.\nThe spokesman said: \u201cRoyal Mail continues to engage with the CWU on a daily basis on this matter. We are pleased that at a local level and through national officers we have been working well together to find practical solutions to the many issues that have emerged. We have a joint interest in protecting our people and we hope that that focus can continue through the operational discussions taking place between our teams.\u201d\nHowever, more than a dozen Royal Mail workers have contacted the Guardian to say they were unhappy about the conditions in their local sorting office.\nOne said that there was not enough hand sanitiser available for post delivery staff to take on their rounds so that they feared taking a drink en route in case they got infected. \u201cWe have staff working shoulder to shoulder. There is one bottle of sanitising gel to be shared by the whole office,\u201d he said.\nAnother said workers were \u201ccramped like sardines\u201d and that many colleagues were off sick.\nThe CWU said it had asked Royal Mail to improve social distancing by cutting the number of staff working each shift and cutting the number of deliveries to three a week, with parcels, packets and first class mail delivered on alternate days.\nIt wants Royal Mail to prioritise the delivery of government communications, testing kits and other services and to halt the delivery of advertising flyers.\nWard said post delivery workers \u201cdeserve better than to be delivering advertising mail at a time of high risk for them and the customers they serve\u201d.\nThe complaints of postal workers echo those of employees in some online retail warehouses, including Asos\u2019s facility in Barnsley, where workers have said they are not happy with the protection on offer.",

        "content": "The health secretary wrote off \u00a313bn of NHS debt, promised 100,000 tests and acted like a grownup\nFor much of the week, it\u2019s been as if the government has gone out of its way to appear wilfully clueless. First, the psychotically unstable Dominic Raab, then the pathologically untrustworthy Michael Gove, culminating with the shambolically underprepared Alok Sharma. History repeating itself first as tragedy, then as farce. It was as if the only real contingency plans the government had made were for the postponement of this year\u2019s climate change conference. Sometimes, doing absolutely nothing proves to be entirely the right option.\nBut cometh the hour \u2026 There are some words I thought I\u2019d never write. Like \u201cThank God for Matt Hancock\u201d. But thank God for Matt Hancock. It seemed a high-risk strategy to send out the health secretary for the daily Downing Street press conference as it was only six days since he announced that he had contracted coronavirus. And the official NHS guidance is for anyone with symptoms to self-isolate for a week.\nMaybe he had first become symptomatic shortly after 5pm last Thursday. That at least would explain why the press conference began 25 minutes late. Matt was merely doing his civic duty. He had been waiting the full seven days and had sneaked into Downing Street under the wire.\nThis was Hancock at his least needy. Though, Matt being Matt, he couldn\u2019t not let slip a slight air of Tiggerishness at the start of his statement. A Tigger\u2019s gotta do what a Tigger\u2019s gotta do. The government had been doing a brilliant job. Everything that was being done was being guided by the science: even if the science the UK government had occasionally seemed out of step with that of countries with rather better track records on treating the disease.\nHe was also positively gushing about the speed at which the 4,000-bed Nightingale hospital had been knocked together in London. In fairness, it\u2019s one hell of an achievement. But by no stretch of the imagination can it be called a proper hospital. It\u2019s a field hospital at best. Let\u2019s hope Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t think he can get away with counting it as one of his promised 40 new hospitals. When push comes to shove, it\u2019s just a much-needed large facility providing basic care for people with respiratory problems. It would be no one\u2019s destination of choice for urgent treatment.\nBut then Tigger dropped the Tigger act. Rishi Sunak apart, for the first time since the pandemic started, a minister stood up to take responsibility for the situation. It\u2019s a weird coincidence that the two ministers who look as if they still need to show ID at off-licences are the ones to show true leadership. Sure, he looked a bit defensive at times, but given the circumstances, that seemed fair enough. He was boldly going where no minister had gone before.\nEven though he didn\u2019t go into details \u2013 such as why the South Koreans and the Germans are able to identify tests that work while we appear to have bought 7.5m kits that we still don\u2019t know are effective or not \u2013 he did admit the government had made mistakes. And now that he was recovering from the illness, he was going to take personal responsibility for putting things right.\nFirst, he was going to write off \u00a313bn of NHS debt. On any other day this would have been the biggest news story \u2013 one that would have horrified most of his fellow Tory MPs \u2013 but now it was nothing more than a throwaway. An academic footnote. He quickly moved on. \u201cI have a five-pillar plan,\u201d he declared. Politicians love to have plans in fives. Four sounds too few and six sounds as if you aren\u2019t thinking clearly. Matt, though, had just one pillar. To fend off ongoing criticism of the government\u2019s testing programme by committing to 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month.\nGiven that the government has consistently missed even its own piss-poor targets \u2013 we\u2019re struggling to manage 10,000 tests a day at the moment \u2013 it was understandable that most of the questions were on whether 100,000 was hopelessly optimistic. But Matt was adamant. He couldn\u2019t exactly promise how many of the tests would be antibody and and how many antigen, but 100,000 was the hill he was prepared to die on. No more bullshit. No more obfuscation. A real target with his job on the line if he failed to deliver.\nTo add to the distinct air of the surreal \u2013 it\u2019s so rare to find a politician behaving like a grownup \u2013 he even allowed journalists follow-up questions. Normally, the minister fails to answer the question and swiftly moves on to the next one. But now Matt was positively inviting interrogation. Had he been clear enough? Do you want more details? Most of the hacks were so startled by this new openness, they didn\u2019t actually have any prepared follow-ups and ad-libbed. For once it was the media doing the waffling.\nFor reasons best known to itself, the BBC got bored with such an informative press conference and cut to the weather forecast halfway through. Apparently it\u2019s going to be a nice weekend to stay indoors. But Sky persevered to the end and Matt extended the press conference to a record-beating 80 minutes. In more ways than one, he had raised the bar considerably for other ministers in the coming weeks.",

Hundreds of kids sent #abc730 video messages of love to their grandmas and grandpas to help bridge the gap. pic.twitter.com/T90EXyUxsY\nFor adults, the ABC has the smash hit daily podcast from Dr Norman Swan, Coronacast podcast, as well as breaking radio news across RN, ABC News Radio and local radio, live announcements on the ABC News channel and daily in-depth coverage on 7.30, which had a very moving segment on kids saying hello to their grandparents.\nBut not everyone is happy with the ABC\u2019s coverage of the pandemic. The Australian\u2019s media columnist Chris Mitchell was so annoyed by Fran Kelly\u2019s interview with health minister Greg Hunt he accused Radio National of being \u201ca shock-jock station\u201d. The former editor-in-chief of the Oz pointed to what he said were examples of excellent interviewing of officials by stablemates Chris Kenny and Andrew Bolt.\nCoronavirus strikes at News Corp HQ\nNews Corp\u2019s headquarters in Holt St, Surry Hills, has three confirmed cases of coronavirus but the building remains open, albeit with just a handful of staff still turning up.\n\u201cWhile our health and safety experts continue to closely monitor the situation there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever the three cases are in any way linked, or that they were contracted at Holt St,\u201d a spokesman told Weekly Beast.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue working closely with NSW Health, which has advised that our Holt St building is safe to remain open. The very small number of staff who had close contact have been identified and informed. Work areas and other impacted areas have been thoroughly deep cleaned to required standards. Only people deemed essential to be in the office and with approval from their managers are working from Holt St. This represents a tiny fraction of our normal Holt St workforce.\u201d\nJob cuts and closures as media industry reels\nThe media industry has been hit extremely hard by the coronavirus pandemic and every day there is more bad news for workers and the consumers who rely on their sources of news. Days after announcing it would have to close, regional newspaper Sunraysia Life is reviving its printed publication with a Saturday-only edition, a glimmer of hope in a bleak landscape. However, the print editions of 60 News Corp community newspapers will close by 9 April.\nAlthough News Corp has vowed to keep the digital community mastheads up, and has not announced any redundancies, Weekly Beast understands the print and digital staff are quite separate at some papers, and many print employees are likely to be affected. We\u2019ve spoken to several contributors who have already lost their gig on newspapers like the popular Sydney eastern suburbs giveaway the Wentworth Courier.\nBREAKING: MMG has stood down staff at its newspapers.\u00a0The ABC understands several journalists lost their jobs last week, as well as an unknown number of employees across graphic design, ad sales and reception.\u00a0Shepparton News has also stopped its Saturday edition. #COVID19Aus pic.twitter.com/TvEuUsiMp4\nOn Friday another small independent publisher cancelled an edition and laid off staff. The McPherson Media Group has 14 newspapers across the Goulburn Valley and Southern Riverina in NSW, including the national publication Dairy News Australia.\nBut the biggest companies have been hard hit too.\nThe managing director and CEO of Seven, James Warburton, had to impose a pay cut on his workforce this week. Already under significant financial pressure, Seven has given all staff above $80,000 a 20% pay cut and a four-day working week. Staff on more than $200,000 will still get the 20% pay cut but will be expected to work five days a week \u201cto help the company navigate the current financial and Covid-19 challenges\u201d.\n\u201cAs you would be aware, we find ourselves in an extraordinary and challenging situation,\u201d Warburton said. \u201cWe are all working to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact it is having on our people, our business and the broader economy.\u201d\nBut even these drastic measures may not be enough and \u201csome job losses will be inevitable\u201d, Warburton warned.\nThis follows moves by News Corp to put most staff on a nine-day fortnight and make everyone take at least four days off over Easter.\nSources told Weekly Beast photographers based at Holt St have been made to take annual and long service leave until the end of June.\nNine Entertainment\u2019s newspapers, heavily reliant on advertising, have had to suspend production of magazines and inserts Boss, Sophisticated Traveller, Luxury, Good Food Magazine and Executive Style, the Traveller lift-out, Domain magazines and The Shortlist/EG event guides.

        "content": "Langstone, Hampshire: The pair get to work high in the canopy, preparing their nest and seeing off predators\nSpurred into action by the spring sunshine, our resident carrion crows have one thing on their minds. Just as they\u2019ve done for the past five years, this pair have begun to build on the foundations of last year\u2019s nest, high in the crown of a statuesque oak \u2013 the tallest tree in their territory.\nUnlike rooks and jackdaws, which are social species and tend to nest in colonies, carrion crows are fairly solitary birds. Reaching sexual maturity at about three years of age, they form socially monogamous but genetically promiscuous pairings. This means that, while they typically mate for life, extra-pair copulation between a female and a male other than her pair-bonded mate is not unusual.\nThe nest is about 15 metres up, near the top of the canopy, close to the trunk and wedged securely between two thick forked limbs. From afar it looks like a platform of jumbled sticks, but through my spotting scope I can see that it is in fact cup-shaped.\nOnce the tree is in leaf, the nest will be concealed from sight, but for now it is in full view of predators and, though they have yet to lay, the crows are actively defending their territory, mobbing the local buzzards as they circle overhead, and seeing off passing sparrowhawks and kestrels. For another measure of protection, they have constructed a decoy nest in a neighbouring tree, conspicuously sited on an outer branch.\nThe male and female have been working together to construct their high-rise abode, taking it in turns to alight on my silver birch and break off twigs. Whippy and full of sap, these don\u2019t snap cleanly. One bird vigorously bends them back and forth, almost toppling over with the effort. The other takes a different approach, twisting a twig to weaken the wood fibres, then tugging it free.\nThese charismatic corvids are often considered to be bad omens. However, as with magpies, in some cultures it is not the mere sighting of a crow but the number of birds that is significant \u2013 two crows are lucky, three bring health and four wealth. During this tumultuous time, the presence of this pair of black-feathered beauties is certainly bringing me joy.\n The first picture on this article was changed on 3 April 2020 because an earlier image was of jackdaws, not carrion crows.",

        "content": "Pandemic forces even the most conservative companies to rethink their practices and let employees work from home\nUntil a few weeks ago Tsutomu Okada never imagined he would be working within earshot of his wife and daughter or talking to colleagues via his laptop.\nBut in Japan, as in other parts of the world, the coronavirus pandemic has forced even the most conservative companies to rethink the way they do business in a country that has been reluctant to embrace the idea of working from home.\n\u201cI used to commute for an hour in either direction, so I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to do that for the time being,\u201d Okada, who is in his late 40s, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd holding meetings online hasn\u2019t been a problem.\u201d\nOkada, an employee of a major company in Tokyo, started working from home two days a week from late February, but has been working remotely full-time since the end of March, amid a sharp rise in reported Covid-19 infections in the capital.\nIronically his firm, which employs more than 40,000 people, had already made plans for staff to work from home several times a month to ease congestion during the Tokyo Olympics, now postponed for a year due to the outbreak.\n\u201cOf course there are times when I have to be in the office, but I can see us continuing with telework for, say, two days a week,\u201d he said, adding that about 80% of his colleagues were now working remotely.\nThe pandemic has forced companies to implement changes the government has been encouraging for several years, in the hope that less demanding office hours would enable more women to return to work after giving birth and men to be more involved in housework and childcare.\nBut few companies followed the government\u2019s advice. A survey last year found that 19% had given staff the option of teleworking, but just 8.5% had taken it up.\nResistance to working from home stems from a corporate culture that values employees being present in the workplace, often for punishingly long hours, to demonstrate their loyalty.\n\u201cThe Japanese still have this image that telework isn\u2019t real work, because you\u2019re not physically in the office,\u201d said Haruka Kazama, an economist at the Mizuho research institute.\nWhile Japan has so far avoided the large number of infections and deaths seen in the US, Europe and China, the outbreak is challenging the traditional image of besuited, exhausted salaryman falling asleep on packed commuter trains following after-hours drinks with colleagues.\n\u201cThe situation has put companies\u2019 backs against the wall,\u201d Kazama said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been forced to give their employees the choice to telework.\u201d\nShortly after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called for staggered commutes and teleworking at the end of February, a poll by Keidanren, a business lobby representing about 400 major firms, found that almost 70% had either implemented teleworking or were planning to do so.\nHitachi has introduced teleworking for 50,000 employees of its group companies in Tokyo, while the advertising agency Dentsu closed its Tokyo headquarters and ordered its 5,000 staff to work from home after an employee tested positive for the virus. Daiwa Securities, with about 10,000 employees, introduced home-based teleworking for staff with small children.\nThe pandemic also enabled employees to experiment with a healthier work-life balance. Yuki Sato, an employee of a start-up in Tokyo, has set up a small office at the home he shares with his wife and two children. Teleworking means he no longer has to endure a long commute and has more time for his daughters, whose schools are closed due to the outbreak.\n\u201cI can also give them their bath in the evening, something I could never do before because I was never home before 8pm,\u201d Sato, who has been working from home since February, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cThis experience has completely changed my image of teleworking.\u201d\nTeleworking has sparked a boost in sales of items such as web cameras and headphones, but some old analogue habits die hard. In an age of electronic contracts, many Japanese companies still require employees to print out documents that are then stamped with official hanko seals, often by several people.\nMariko Kitano, who works for a TV production company, believes the last few weeks have proved that more flexible working practices should continue long after the coronavirus crisis has subsided.\n\u201cThere are times when you have to go into the office, but about 80% of my colleagues have been working from home since late February,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI live alone, so I\u2019ve found teleworking really useful. I meet my deadlines, of course, but I can take a break now and then to do things like hang out the laundry.\u201d\nThere are times, though, when teleworking is no substitute for face-to-face contact, Kitano added. \u201cI\u2019m mentoring junior colleagues and it\u2019s sometimes frustrating not to be able to see what they\u2019re doing and offer advice in person.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we can go back to the way things were, despite the traditional view in Japan that you can only prove your worth by working hard in front of your boss. The past few weeks have proved that teleworking has too many advantages to be ditched.\u201d\n*Okada and Kitano\u2019s names have been changed at their request.\nAgence France-Presse contributed reporting.",

        "content": "There is plenty of food to go round, which means there is no need for panic buying. But who said our relationship with food was fully rational? By Bee Wilson\nThis is a piece about panic buying in the time of coronavirus, and maybe I should stop right there. None of us needs more panic in our lives right now. If there\u2019s one thing psychologists can agree on, it\u2019s that panicky behaviour is contagious. Every time we read an article telling us not to be selfish and ransack the supermarkets, it triggers the thought that food is running out and we must urgently get to the nearest Tesco and buy five packets of pasta and as many tinned tomatoes and lentils as we can carry.\nThese are certainly unsettled times in which to feed ourselves. Over the past month, we have been exposed to an uncanny sight that has been almost unknown in Britain for decades: empty supermarket shelves. When you are not used to it, this sight does strange things to your insides.\nTwo weeks ago, pre-lockdown, I popped to Sainsbury\u2019s on the way home from school with my 11-year-old son. He drags his heels at shopping, but I assured him I only wanted to buy potatoes. I had everything else I needed for a shepherd\u2019s pie. But we stopped in our tracks to see that there were no potatoes and indeed, no vegetables of any kind anywhere in the fresh produce aisle, except for a few sad packs of drooping mixed veg for stir fries. The locusts had been. I was aware that hand sanitiser and pasta and toilet roll were in short supply, but hadn\u2019t realised that the fresh and frozen produce aisles were now emptying, too. I suddenly felt shaky. The last time I had seen a food shop with so little actual stuff in it relative to the shelves was on a school trip to Soviet Russia 30 years ago. My son\u2019s eyes lit up: boring old food shopping had become a post-apocalyptic scavenger hunt. \u201cWill frozen roast potatoes work in a shepherd\u2019s pie?\u201d he exclaimed in the near-empty wastes of the frozen food section.\nWhat is generally called panic buying \u2013 a common human response to crisis \u2013 is not caused by food shortages per se, but by fear. At its root is a fear of scarcity, and this fear is self-fulfilling, because the more people anxiously stockpile, the more others get infected by the panic and the faster the food runs out. According to Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of The Psychology of Pandemics, which was published last year, there are parallels between the ways people are behaving now and the way they behaved during earlier pandemics such as the Spanish flu of 1918, when there was panic buying of Vicks VapoRub, and the 1968 flu pandemic, when food was looted from restaurants. The difference now, Taylor observes, is that the panic can escalate much faster via social media and online news.\n\u201cInevitably, someone posts dramatic photographs of panic buying,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThis amplifies the sense of scarcity and perceived urgency, which leads to further panic buying.\u201d\nThe American food writer Helen Rosner has noted an element of \u201cfantasy\u201d to the shoppers who fill entire trolleys with cases of mineral water, given that \u201cstaying at home for a few weeks isn\u2019t quite nuclear holocaust\u201d. We need to keep reminding ourselves that there is still generally plenty of food going around, even if it does not always reach the right people at the right time. Prof Tim Benton, who is research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank, told me that the UK has \u201cfull warehouses\u201d of non-perishable food and that \u201cthe flow of fruit and vegetables from Europe is OK at the moment\u201d, although distribution has clearly been made much more challenging by the spread of coronavirus in Spain and Italy, and the fact that lorries carrying fresh foods have been subject to more delays and checks than before. But there is still food in the shops. Rationally, we don\u2019t need to panic.\nBut who said the human relationship with food was fully rational? Many people reacted to news of the virus by rushing to the shops, as if the prospect of running low on coffee beans were more terrifying than the risk of exposing yourself or others to infection. One of these people was me. Along with a couple of extra bags of coffee, I stocked up on ground almonds for my daughter who loves to bake; and lemons because they improve everything.\nUncertainty breeds fear, and fear makes a person wonder whether there is enough butter in the fridge. The restrictions on our movement in recent days and weeks, coupled with a daily drip-feed of unease, have been unlike anything most of us can remember. We can\u2019t visit our elderly relatives or even find out whether we are infected or not, but we can at least stock our kitchens with sardines and long-life milk \u2013 or gin, as the case may be \u2013 to give us the sense that we are somehow prepared. As the Harvard epidemiologist Karestan Koenen says, \u201cfood buying helps us feel in control\u201d.\nThe way we eat at any given time reflects our national state of mind. For 50 years or more in the UK, we have been eating with the largesse of a people who felt that food was an inexhaustible fountain. Unlike the wartime generation, we did not worry too much about wasting odds and ends or saving the bit of bread that was not mouldy, because we knew that there would always be another loaf. Nor did we have to keep track of the seasons, because in the never-ending summer of the supermarkets, blueberries could be shipped in for our pleasure no matter what the month. Yes, there were food banks, but most of the population could push the idea of scarcity far to the back of our minds. For many, these past few weeks have been a shock: a moment when almost everyone in the country felt at least a bit insecure about food, and started to realise that the fountain could dry up.\nIn some ways, this has been a rare moment of clarity, when we finally recognise how much we owe to the low-paid \u201ckey workers\u201d who put in the hours to grow and harvest and pack and cook and deliver so that the rest of us can have food available at all times. But with that clarity comes a new unease. The panic buying and shortages \u2013 even if temporary \u2013 have revealed to us that our food system is built on a far less solid foundation than we imagined.\nOn 20 March, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, commented that people should buy only \u201cwhat they need and not more than what they need\u201d. You can tell that something radical has shifted in our attitudes to food shopping when the Conservative party \u2013 which for so long has defended the right of the food industry to sell us anything it likes, regardless of its effects on our health \u2013 starts asking people to restrict what they buy for the sake of others.\nHancock\u2019s comments were prompted by a much-shared video featuring a critical care nurse called Dawn Bilbrough, who filmed herself in tears after coming off a 48-hour shift in intensive care and finding that she was unable to buy any fruit or vegetables in the supermarket. \u201cYou are just stripping the shelves bare of essential foods,\u201d Bilbrough says in the video. \u201cJust stop it. Because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you\u2019re at your lowest, so just stop it. Please!\u201d\nTo watch Bilbrough\u2019s video is to feel a visceral reaction against the selfish stockpilers who have deprived this hard-working NHS nurse of fresh produce. Her righteous rage is the same anger that people have felt throughout history towards the hoarders and speculators who put their own interests above the common good. During the Great Famine of England and Wales in 1315-17, the lords hoarded grain while the poor starved. In times of war, hoarding is loathed more than ever, and tends to be more severely policed. In 1941, an egg dealer in Folkestone was sentenced to three months of hard labour for illegally hoarding thousands of eggs and selling them on the black market. With rationing in place, to fiddle the system by taking more than your fair share of food was seen as an appalling form of cheating.\nBut what on earth would a fair share of food be by today\u2019s standards? Nowadays, you might get through half a week\u2019s wartime ration for meat and eggs in a single breakfast. There was an outcry during the first days of lockdown when some convenience stores reported that police had been trying to stop shopkeepers from selling Easter eggs on the grounds that they were not \u201cessential\u201d food.\nFor more than half a century, the freedom and abundance of our food system taught us that we could have whatever we want, whenever we wanted it, assuming we could pay. Over the past five years, food delivery services took this freedom still further. Whatever our hearts desired could be ordered up on an app and biked round in minutes, without fear of being judged for ordering too much or failing to share. Suddenly, coronavirus has tested the limits of our rights as consumers. For many modern families, there has been a profound shock to this new reality.\nEating is once again framed as a moral act. There have always been people who felt reassured by bulk buying, and the rest of us didn\u2019t feel the need to judge them for this quirk. But our scrutiny of others has sharpened \u2013 and some individual behaviour has been remarkably irresponsible. Supermarket workers have described acts of astonishing selfishness. In an excellent article for HuffPost, American grocery store worker Karleigh Frisbie Brogan described in horrified terms watching one shopper \u201cuse his forearm to empty a shelf of refried beans into his cart\u201d. As coronavirus spread through Singapore in February, there was an outcry when a photo was shared on Facebook of a middle-aged woman in a medical mask pushing a trolley piled to shoulder height with instant noodles. Most of the reactions consisted of crying with laughter emojis coupled with insults. Several people suggested that this \u201caunty\u201d would die not from coronavirus but from an overdose of MSG.\nMost of us would not go so far as to wish harm on the hoarders, although we can certainly unite in righteous indignation against these new villains of our post-coronavirus life. Besides the selfish shoppers who clear the shelves of fresh fruit, there are cold-hearted profiteers who buy up essential foods, as well as hand wash and face masks to sell them on at an inflated price. Sky News reported finding a carton of formula milk (normal price: \u00a311) being sold on eBay for more than \u00a3300.\nThe media have focused heavily on these stories of hysterical greed in the shops. \u201cSelfish Tesco shoppers block NHS staff from getting into supermarket after working gruelling 60 hours on coronavirus frontline\u201d read one headline from the Sun on 23 March. But this fixation with selfish shoppers is not good for anyone\u2019s anxiety levels. Some eating-disorder sufferers \u2013 who are already often grappling with feelings of guilt about buying food \u2013 have reported that reading stories of panic buying have triggered worries that they must not buy food at all, lest they be taking food away from people who need it more. Another reason we should stop talking so much about the stockpilers is that their role in the current upheaval (or their responsibility for the current shortages) is probably not all that important.\nHave you noticed that one of the main features of panic buying is that it is always done by other people, and never by ourselves? It is a label we attach to others in order to make ourselves feel better about our own shopping choices. He panic buys. You stock up. I tirelessly provide food for my family.\nA binary opposition has sprung up in our culture between shoppers \u2013 who are portrayed as grasping and selfish \u2013 and workers \u2013 who are heroic, especially anyone who works for the NHS. But NHS workers go shopping, too. Some of the people who took vegetables from the shelves before Dawn Bilbrough got there will have been other nurses just like her. They probably didn\u2019t take much more than usual.\nTrue panic buying \u2013 as in, cupboards full to the rafters with ramen noodles or packets of pasta \u2013 is actually much less common than we think. When market analysis firm Kantar Worldpanel looked at data from 100,000 UK shoppers in mid-March, it found that only 3% of the population engaged in full-blown panic buying. The rest of the increase in food sales over the past month \u2013 an extra \u00a31bn in the first three weeks of March \u2013 could be explained by consumers adding just a few extra items here and there. Chris Morley of Kantar wrote that the research suggested \u201chuge volumes of consumers were adding a few extra purchases of products they normally buy, and adding a few purchases of categories that they don\u2019t often buy into their trolley or basket [lentils being an obvious example] and were shopping more regularly than usual\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the term panic buying,\u201d says risk expert Tim Benton. He admits that there have been a few examples of \u201cstupidity\u201d from consumers in the shops, but he argues that for the most part, our patterns of shopping in recent weeks have been a \u201crisk-resilience issue\u201d rather than a \u201cpanic response\u201d. People have been told it is their duty to go home and stay there (and in some countries such as Canada, consumers have been explicitly told by politicians to stock up with enough supplies to last a week or two). At the same time, people can no longer have lunch or dinner outside of the home at cafes or restaurants or work canteens, which previously would have accounted for around 30% of all calories eaten in per day in the UK. \u201cThey can\u2019t eat out, so they stock their larders,\u201d says Benton.\nSome of the people buying more food than usual will have been doing so in order to help out friends and neighbours who are stranded at home. In Singapore in February, journalist Annie Tan observed that many people \u201cdecided to multiply their shopping list\u201d in order to \u201cspare their friends and family from knee-numbing queues\u201d. I have seen the same thing here, with WhatsApp groups filling up with neighbourly offers to share everything from fresh fruit to self-raising flour.\nInstead of panic buying, perhaps we should speak more of resilience buying. There is solace in feeling prepared, especially when we actually have no idea what\u2019s coming next. During the second world war, the writer Alice B Toklas lived in rural France with the art collector Gertrude Stein. In The Alice B Toklas Cookbook, she describes how she accumulated a store of dried fruits, including 4lb of citron and 2lb of raisins, which she was saving to make a liberation fruit cake when the war was over. From time to time, she would look at the fruit in its jars and feel \u201ccheered\u201d during the \u201cdismal days of that winter\u201d.\nThis is not a war, thank God. Many people are invoking the spirit of the blitz \u2013 and some of us are certainly digging for victory, judging from the fact that vegetable seeds have been bought in vast quantities. But we are not having to make do with wartime rations of dried egg just yet. Knowing that we have a store of the half a dozen things we dread running out of can make us more equipped to summon up the reserves of patience and humour we are all going to need over the next few weeks.\nWhen I put out a request on Twitter asking what items people felt they needed to stock up on most urgently, I was stunned to receive more than 1,300 replies. Many of them read like prose poems, speaking of private passions. \u201cParmesan. Just parmesan,\u201d read one. \u201cGarlic, olive oil, capers, anchovies, bacon. With them I can make any pulse, grain, or starch taste great,\u201d was another answer, from food broadcaster Sheila Dillon. Chef Alex Rushmer replied that his one essential was Lao Gan Ma crispy chilli oil, because, \u201cIf all you had was rice and noodles, Lao Gan Ma would make it OK.\u201d\nCommon themes emerged. Apart from the obvious answers of staple grains, other popular essentials included onions, ginger and garlic, frozen veg, lemons and cheese, butter and oil, various kinds of pickles and spices: all ingredients for enhancing a meal rustled up from pantry goods. Many people named their favourite stimulants, from teabags to coffee to wine. \u201cDark chocolate, floor cleaner, gin\u201d, read one of the most bracingly honest replies. Someone wrote from day 15 of lockdown in Madrid to warn that although she had laid in 10 litres of olive oil, she had not anticipated how much chocolate she would want: \u201cYou\u2019ll need comfort food after a hard, sad day.\u201d\nThe spirit that mostly emerged from these tweets was not one of panic, but of warmth and resourcefulness. People started to swap helpful tips on where to source certain hard-to-find products. There was a discussion of the fact that yeast \u2013 which is near-unobtainable in mainstream supermarkets, because so many people have started baking for comfort during lockdown \u2013 could still be found in some Polish shops, where it is labelled dro\u017cd\u017ce.\nOne of the most noticeable features of the current food shortages is the way they have disproportionately affected supermarkets rather than independent shops. A few weeks ago, when there were acres of empty shelves in the out-of-town hypermarkets, I strolled into a medium-sized Turkish shop near where I live in Cambridge and found plentiful supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables, cheeses and yoghurts, dried goods and breads and much more. Many of the items were both cheaper and more appetising than the supermarket equivalent, yet I didn\u2019t witness any customers piling their basket especially high. In a family-run shop like this, you would feel silly to clear the shelves. Others have reported that Korean and Chinese supermarkets in the UK have generally remained much better stocked than the big supermarket chains.\nAnd yet many British people still ignore these independent shops, in their eagerness to join the queue at a hollowed-out supermarket. It is as if we have been brainwashed to believe that these familiar superstores are the only ones that can supply us with the abundance and choice we have become accustomed to.\nFor years, food policy expert Tim Lang has been an almost lone voice in the wilderness, arguing that UK food security needs to be improved. In his new, very timely book \u2013 Feeding Britain: Our Food Problems and How to Fix Them \u2013 Lang notes that most consumers think that \u201cas long as there is food on the supermarket shelves, all is well in the world. It is not.\u201d According to Lang, Britain has long had \u201ca false sense of security about food\u201d, and all the more so post-Brexit. There\u2019s an assumption that, as a rich country, we will always be able to buy the produce we need from abroad, but this is a risky assumption in times of crisis.\nThe empty shelves we have been so shocked by are not just reflective of the behaviour of individual shoppers, but of a supermarket system based on \u201cjust in time\u201d delivery systems. The idea \u2013 eagerly embraced by all the major UK food retailers \u2013 is that the business carries minimal stock, buying only what it needs at any given time, to save on the cost of storage. It\u2019s an efficient and highly profitable model \u2013 as long as imports are freely flowing. But even in the good times, as Lang explains in his book, the plenty in our supermarkets was based on \u201cstretched and risky food supply chains\u201d. The current crisis has laid bare the problems with having a food system so heavily weighted towards imports.\nA country with the UK\u2019s climate will never be fully self-sufficient in food \u2013 we can\u2019t grow our own coffee beans, to take one pressing example \u2013 but Lang argues that far more land should be given over to food production. \u201cThe UK cannot grow rice or mangoes or bananas, but it could grow 100% of apples, pears and soft fruit, and a more diverse range of vegetables.\u201d\nAnother weakness in our food supply that coronavirus has highlighted is that it is so unfairly and unequally distributed across the population. The coronavirus outbreak has pushed millions of people in the UK to the brink of food poverty. A report from the Food Foundation in March found that the combination of self-isolation, erratic food availability and a drop in income was leaving many vulnerable households at serious risk of not being able to access an adequate diet without government aid. During the week before lockdown, a food bank in Enfield reported an 80% surge in visitors. As Tim Benton comments, the question is not currently whether there is enough food in the UK, but who gets it \u2013 and that ultimately needs to be addressed by the government.\nThe problem of individual panic buying may turn out to be a trivial worry compared with other, deeper issues in the food system, such as how to remodel it to deliver healthy food for all. Since social distancing and some temporary rationing were put in place in UK supermarkets, panic buying has largely taken care of itself. Because of the social distancing rules, one day last week I found myself one of only 11 people allowed inside a small supermarket. Each item was limited to no more than three per customer, but I only saw people take one or two. The atmosphere felt as hushed as a church, and I noticed that everything from eggs to \u2013 yes! \u2013 potatoes were now available again. Steven Taylor, expert in the psychology of pandemics, notes that rationing is a far more effective strategy for stopping panic buying during a pandemic than either pleas from the government or \u201csocial shaming and ridicule\u201d. Once rationing is in place \u201cand people can see that they can still obtain staples, fears of scarcity tend to abate\u201d.\nA much more serious issue on the horizon is panic buying not by consumers, but by governments. On 24 March, Bloomberg reported that some governments had started to put in place protectionist food policies as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Serbia has halted exports of sunflower oil and Kazakhstan is no longer allowing wheat flour or carrots to leave the country. If such protectionism spreads widely, it could result in higher prices and shortages of certain commodities, particularly for a country such as Britain that is so heavily dependent on imported food.\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d says Tim Benton, \u201cis that the more countries [engage in hoarding food], the free flow of food becomes sticky and imports start getting hammered.\u201d Technically, there is enough food in the world to feed current populations. According to the Agricultural Market Information System, which tracks food supplies across the world, \u201cglobal reserves of non-perishable goods such as wheat and rice should be sufficient to meet any imminent demand\u201d. Trade runs on trust, but at this moment of crisis, many countries seem to be feeling jittery and thinking only of national interests. Benton notes that in the current global food system \u201cwe are seeing every country working for itself\u201d. His concern is what could happen to imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from Europe into the UK, given shortages of labour in southern Europe as a result of coronavirus.\nThese are testing times for food delivery drivers, as Dan Saladino reported on a recent episode of the BBC Food Programme. There have been cases of drivers making the epic journey back from Spain or Italy with lorryfuls of fresh food, only to be turned away at distribution sites in the UK because of fears that they might be bringing in infection. The rest of us should be grateful that, for now, there are still plentiful supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables in Europe, and drivers still prepared to make the trip and get it for us. But we need to stop taking this bountiful flow of food for granted, and start thinking about building a more resilient system. As Benton points out: \u201cYou can\u2019t stockpile lettuce.\u201d\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

        "content": "Beijing \u2018aims to turn national disaster into global triumph\u2019 with help of TV news channel and Twitter\nThe Chinese state is ramping up its English-language media campaigns in a bid to defend the country\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, highlight the failings of western governments, and raise China\u2019s standing on the world stage.\nPhotographs of Chinese aid \u2013 dubbed \u201cfacemask diplomacy\u201d \u2013 arriving at Heathrow on Saturday including boxes labelled \u201cKeep Calm and Cure Coronavirus\u201d have been promoted to UK audiences by the Xinhua news agency. Some younger Chinese diplomats have used English-language Twitter, which is banned within China, to spread false suggestions that the virus may have been started by the west to discredit the Chinese state.\nProf Kerry Brown, an associate fellow on the Asia-Pacific programme at the thinktank Chatham House, suggested the country was trying to turn a national disaster into a global triumph: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to push back against some of the politicisation of this in America and to try to get control of the narrative before it spirals out of control.\u201d\nChina\u2019s authoritarian single-party state, which is at the bottom of the World Press Freedom Index and has faced recent claims of playing down its coronavirus infection numbers, has long complained of unfair coverage by western media and recently expelled many western journalists. In recent years it has invested enormous sums of money in its own English-language news infrastructure to project its image around the world.\nAt the forefront of this response has been the state-owned English-language 24-hour rolling news channel CGTN, which recently began broadcasting from a new UK base in west London with a mission statement of \u201creporting the news from a Chinese perspective\u201d.\nAlthough CGTN is facing ongoing investigations by the media regulator Ofcom over its impartiality and other issues around press freedom, its criticism of western governments is less overt than that of other state-backed news networks such Russia Today or Iran\u2019s Press TV.\nInstead, in the past week the channel has broadcast a combination of inspiring individual stories about Chinese doctors saving lives against the odds during the coronavirus pandemic, videos of Chinese aid arriving in European and African nations, and footage of China\u2019s economy already recovering from the lockdown \u2013 along with more unusual footage, such as film of an Ethiopian man who believed he could stop the infection by putting garlic up his nose.\nOn Thursday afternoon, it aired a series of interviews with Chinese diplomats and medical workers across Europe, with a presenter introducing interviews on how \u201cChina\u2019s experience fighting Covid-19 is proving invaluable to other countries trying to contain the crisis\u201d.\nThey also interviewed the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands who criticised western media for their coverage of coronavirus aid: \u201cDo they really wish China to stand by? I believe public opinion in the west is appreciative of China and its help.\u201d\nLijian Zhao, a young Chinese diplomat who has been likened to Donald Trump for his outsized and aggressively nationalistic Twitter personality, has also spread links to conspiracy theory websites suggesting the virus may have been created by the US.\nThis article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it. COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US. https://t.co/LPanIo40MR\nZhao is among a group of so-called \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats and state media accounts, named after a patriotic film from 2015, that have become more outspoken, especially in defending China\u2019s role in the outbreak. Over the past year, more Chinese diplomats as well as the foreign ministry have joined Twitter, posting in English and promoting China\u2019s perspective on issues from human rights violations in Xinjiang to the US-China trade war.\nThe cybersecurity researchers Recorded Future said they had noticed a distinct shift in tone on Chinese-run social media accounts in mid-February, which sought to move the narrative \u201cfrom China as the source of the pandemic to China as a global leader in its response\u201d.\nIn line with this approach dozens of branded articles from the Chinese state-controlled People\u2019s Daily have appeared on the Daily Telegraph website under a lucrative sponsorship deal, with headlines such as \u201cWhy are some framing China\u2019s heroic efforts to stop coronavirus as inhumane?\u201d Many of these have been removed from the UK newspaper\u2019s website in recent days, in a development first reported by BuzzFeed News.\nChinese companies have also done their best to help. Huawei, the telecoms giant at the centre of a global tussle over 5G mobile phone equipment, has donated thousands of facemasks to the UK under the slogan \u201cTogether we support the NHS\u201d. But while the move was applauded by the Apprentice host, Lord Sugar, to his millions of Twitter followers, the company has not promoted its role \u2013 potentially out of concerns of how the gift would be perceived.\nWhat is unclear is whether western audiences are being influenced by the Chinese material. CGTN\u2019s viewing figures are not publicly recorded but unlike Russia Today it is not available on the main Freeview broadcast service, while the online audience for Xinhua\u2019s UK Facebook page attracts very few interactions.\nBrown said there had been surprise in China at some of the negative reaction to donations of masks: \u201cThe Chinese complaint is when you sent aid for earthquakes in the past, we didn\u2019t complain. It\u2019s symptomatic of this cultural clash over news management.\u201d\nHe also said that current English-language campaigns by Chinese state-backed media outlets were still far too conservative in their approach compared with more effective and \u201cinsidious\u201d propaganda efforts by nations such as Russia.\n\u201cPeople bang on about Chinese influence in the media but it\u2019s too obvious \u2013 it walks down the street on stilts with a big sign above it saying \u2018government messaging\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they get good at it, we won\u2019t know. When they get good at it we have a problem.\u201d\nFrance has also become alarmed at attempts by China to use the coronavirus outbreak to project the superiority of its political system.\nIn an internal note, CAPS, the in-house thinktank of the country\u2019s foreign ministry, warned that China would take control of globalisation and future global governance in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak unless democratic states offered something better than sticking-plaster solutions once the crisis had ended.\n\u201cEven if China cannot claim leadership similar to that which the United States would have assumed a few years ago, China is already occupying the field by making itself essential, even central,\u201d it read.\nAdditional reporting by Patrick Wintour",

        "content": "Dramatists have long focused on the agonies and irritations of self-imposed or enforced isolation\n\u2018I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space,\u201d says Hamlet. He should be so lucky. A lot of plays in the history of drama deal with self-imposed or enforced isolation. Here are just a few to remind us that our current situation is not without precedent.\nSpare a thought for Sophocles\u2019s hero. He\u2019s been dumped on the isle of Lemnos for nine years with a festering snake bite that stinks to high heaven \u2013 that\u2019s why the Greeks abandoned him en route for Troy. Mind you, he\u2019s not without company: Odysseus and Neoptolemus turn up to trick him into returning since they need his expertise as an archer. There\u2019s an ironically happy ending, but Sophocles is the first great dramatist to explore the corrosive effect of isolation.\nCan plays do any good? This one is often cited because the wordless central scene shows a young clerk, sent to prison for forgery, locked up alone and beating furiously and helplessly on his cell door. Winston Churchill, on his sixth evening as home secretary, went to the first night and was so shocked by what he saw that he changed the law on solitary confinement and ordered that political prisoners, including militant suffragettes, be treated differently from hardened criminals.\n\u201cHell is other people,\u201d is the line everyone remembers from Sartre\u2019s tragedy of confinement: one that shows a neurotic pacifist, a female infanticide and a lesbian postal worker locked up together for eternity. Even though dead, the trio seek to destroy each other. But you could argue that Sartre\u2019s gloomy message is contradicted by our current crisis, where isolation is encouraging charity and goodwill. The play\u2019s real pertinence comes from the Beckettian final line, \u201cEh bien, continuons,\u201d as the trio confront an unending fractious co-existence.\nPinter had several alternative titles for this bleakly brilliant play: A Tomb of Honour, The Last Toast, Closing Time, Night Quartet. All reek of desolation and finality. Yet there is also wit and humour in the play, which shows Spooner, a minor pub-poet, seeking to penetrate the drink-fuelled defences of a self-immured writer, Hirst. There is much comedy in their canter through an imagined past and a strange gallantry about Spooner\u2019s final attempt to rescue Hirst from a permanent entombment.\nBeckett was the poet of terminal stages, and all his plays deal, in one way or another, with confinement or solitude. This, however, is one of the most haunting in the way the physical action perfectly embodies the theme. We watch as May, a middle-aged woman, paces relentlessly up and down a narrow strip of stage communing with her bedridden mother whom we hear but do not see. It is both an image of filial servitude and of timeless human suffering. Take May out of her setting, as a production once did by having her roam about the theatre, and Beckett\u2019s vision is shattered.\nChurchill often deals in big social themes but this play \u2013 part of a quartet seen at the Royal Court last September \u2013 had an eerie, claustrophobic resonance. The central image was of a pair of ageing cousins cooped up together in uneasy harmony and bound together by a dark secret. They have a pair of young visitors, but there was an element of the comic-macabre about the relationship between Toby Jones\u2019s depressive Jimmy and Deborah Findlay\u2019s quietly murderous Dot. It says a lot about the play\u2019s suggestive power that you wonder how they would cope with our current enforced lockdown.",

        "content": "Carers, wildlife rangers and scientists are among the workers shocked to find themselves fighting to keep their country afloat\nWhat Mar\u00eda would most like to do at the end of each long day\u2019s siege at the care home where she works is yield to the small source of comfort she has denied herself for almost a month now.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to hug my children, but I\u2019m so scared that I haven\u2019t done that for three weeks,\u201d says Mar\u00eda, who asked to use a pseudonym. \u201cI haven\u2019t been tested \u2013 so I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m positive.\u201d\nInstead of stopping for a hug when she gets home, Mar\u00eda leaves her shoes by the door, heads for the shower, and then makes sure her face mask remains in place at all times.\nThe self-imposed strictures are painful but necessary. Health authorities across the country are scrambling to disinfect Spain\u2019s care homes, which have become one of the frontlines of the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis. To date, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people in Spain and claimed more than 10,000 lives.\nBy Mar\u00eda\u2019s reckoning, 50 residents of the home near Madrid where she works have died in the past three weeks, while around 90 others are isolated in empty rooms.\n\u201cAll the tests on residents have come back positive so far,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the doctor says how many tests were coming back positive, she said, \u2018My God! It\u2019s already too late to do something about this. We\u2019re probably all positive already.\u2019\u201d\nEven so, Mar\u00eda and her colleagues have yet to be tested \u2013 or properly equipped as they wash, dress, feed and take their charges to the bathroom.\nMasks have been provided, but they are having to improvise gowns out of rubbish bags. According to the CSIF public workers\u2019 union, two care home workers have died from the virus in the Madrid region and another 400 have become infected. Across Spain, health workers make up around 14% of all coronavirus cases.\nMadrid\u2019s regional government activated an emergency plan to deal with the situation on 26 March and has been sending health workers, civil protection staff and firefighters to assess and deal with the situation in each of the area\u2019s 470 care facilities. By Friday this week, emergency teams had visited 100 of them, according to a spokesman.\nOn Thursday, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, president of the Madrid region, said \u201caround 3,000\u201d people had died of various causes in the region\u2019s old people\u2019s homes during March. A week earlier, her administration said that 1,065 Madrid care home residents had died over the first three weeks of March. The disparity suggests a huge surge in fatalities in the past few days.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard being there and knowing there\u2019s nothing you can do and that they\u2019re dying, one after another,\u201d says Mar\u00eda. \u201cYou do what you can, but staff are getting sick and the home is running with a minimum of people.\u201d\nWhile staff try to muddle through, residents sit in isolation, some lucky enough to have mobile phones to speak to their families, some not. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck in their rooms, where they have to eat. They\u2019re confused and frightened because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nLast week, Spain\u2019s defence minister revealed that soldiers from Spain\u2019s specialist military emergencies unit had found a number of elderly people abandoned and dead in their beds as they arrived to disinfect care homes.\nBut the unit is not the only group to find itself tasked with trying to save lives by bleaching away the virus.\nJavier Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda has been a wildlife ranger for 14 years. Until recently, the worst situations he had found himself in were trying to stop forest fires in their tracks and dealing with violent gangs of mushroom hunters.\nFor the past fortnight, however, he and a crew of fellow rangers and other volunteers have been working to disinfect care homes across the region of Soria, 230km northeast of Madrid.\nThey, at least, have good kit: suits, gloves, face masks, goggles, hoods, rubber boots, and a backpack for the spray.\n\u201cWe try to be quite jolly when we go into a home,\u201d says Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda. \u201cWe say hello to everybody because it\u2019s pretty odd for the old people to see us dressed like that \u2013 they\u2019ve only seen the gear in movies and information films.\u201d\nThe 50-year-old ranger has told his girlfriend about his volunteering duties, but not his parents \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want them to know and to worry\u201d.\nStill, says Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda, the work of recent days has been an education; the fear he felt at first has been replaced by action and a sense of purpose.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s a bit like fighting a fire: if you\u2019re not used to it, you worry because you\u2019re trying to figure out how to deal with something you\u2019ve never dealt with before. But once you\u2019ve put out a fire, you\u2019re calmer and you know what to do.\u201d\nAltogether more accustomed to fires like these is Luis Encinas. While he demurs at being called an expert on epidemics \u2013 \u201cI have a certain experience of outbreaks with low human resources and material and logistic limitations\u201d \u2013 the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res coordinator has seen more than a dozen outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever, including Ebola, and worked in war zones including Afghanistan and Angola.\nAll of which makes it even odder to be deployed in his home country as the medical charity sets up temporary hospitals and works to take some of the pressure off Spain\u2019s desperately overstretched health system.\n\u201cYou want to support the system in your own country, but it\u2019s really, really strange,\u201d says Encinas. \u201cIt\u2019s a mix of sadness and a will to help. We worked in Spain during the migration crisis, but not on internal stuff.\u201d\nHe doubts that any health system in the world would have had the capacity to cope with the pandemic, adding that Europe and other parts of the developed world haven\u2019t seen a crisis on this scale since the second world war or the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.\n\u201cThat means we\u2019ve had generations who have grown up free and healthy and seen life expectancy rising each year,\u201d he says. \u201cSo now, it\u2019s \u2018Wow! How could I have imagined this?\u2019.\n\u201cToday, the focus is on saving lives and and prioritising when it comes to greatest need. But once this is all over and done, it\u2019ll be important to analyse this and learn the lessons.\u201d\nAmong those lessons are humility, planning and preparation: \u201cLet\u2019s look at things so we can say what the plan will be if 40 Covid-19 patients arrive at my ER tomorrow? Or 400, or 4,000? What will the plan be?\u201d\nMar\u00eda\u2019s personal plans extend little beyond trying to get through one day, steeling herself for the next, and keeping her levels of fear, fatigue and exposure as low as possible.\n\u201cI had a really bad day last week when a lot of people died and no one seemed to care. I was so tired and fed up that I came home and said, \u2018That\u2019s it. I need to take a few days off to rest and recover.\u2019\u201d\nHer teenage daughter had other ideas.

        "content": "Fewer law enforcement officials going into the field open door for land invasions, indigenous communities and NGOs warn\nThe coronavirus pandemic is weakening Brazilian state protection for the Amazon rainforest and its people ahead of this year\u2019s fire season, according to indigenous communities and international NGOs.\nFewer law enforcement officials are going out into the field and monitoring missions are being scaled back, opening the door for more land invasions and forest clearance, they warn.\nIndigenous groups \u2013 who are the forest\u2019s main defenders \u2013 are retreating into isolation to avoid the disease and appealing for food and medical supplies. In some areas, they report an uptick in invasions by miners, driven partly by the rise in the price of gold since the start of the global crisis.\nThis week, Brazil reported its first Covid-19 case in its indigenous population, but as the pandemic extends through the country, death threats and violence against indigenous peoples continue, most recently with the fifth killing of a Guajajara forest guardian in five months.\nLast year deforestation and fire hit their highest levels in more than a decade, following ultra-right president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s weakening of environmental protections, encouragement of loggers and miners, and criticism of indigenous communities and conservation organisations.\nThe government\u2019s main environmental protection agency, Ibama, has acknowledged that even fewer agents are going out into the field due to Covid-19 risks. After years of personnel cuts, a third of the staff are close to retirement age, which means they are considered more vulnerable to the disease. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can take these people who are at risk and expose them to the virus,\u201d Olivaldi Azevedo, director of environmental protection, told Reuters.\nThe official said the Amazon would not be affected, but activists in the state of Rond\u00f4nia said they had already noticed a reduction in activity by Ibama and ICMBio (the state agency that maintains national parks) and a resurgent threat from land grabbers.\nThe environmental group WWF and its local partner Kanind\u00e9 say a major invasion is being planned in the coming days near the Alto Jamari village in the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau indigenous territory.\nThe land grabbers aim to gather a large group and start a riot as a pretext to enter the area and divide up the land. \u201cIt\u2019s starting next week so they want to build a team and go down there,\u201d said a WhatsApp audio message, which has been passed on to the Guardian.\nThis is not the first menace to the indigenous community, which has previously ejected illegal settlers and faced death threats. But villagers say the pandemic has strengthened the hand of criminals against the already reduced authorities.\n\u201cThe invaders know that this disease is weakening the inspection bodies even more,\u201d one of the villagers, Awapy Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, told the environmental group.\nWWF Brazil plans to donate 14 drones to indigenous communities and local governments so they can conduct their own real-time surveillance. \u201cNever has this been more important than during the current global health crisis, when official monitoring is being scaled back, bringing the threat of an escalation of invasions on indigenous territories\u201d said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK.\nOn the first flight over Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory, locals discovered 1.4 hectares had been cleared without their knowledge last year and they have recently spotted planes dropping grass seeds on the area so the land can be used for cattle grazing.\nThe Yanomami territory in Roraima state has seen an influx of illegal miners. Although this started before the pandemic, environmental groups fear the trend will accelerate because the crisis has pushed up the price of gold and the economic downturn that is forecast to follow will push more people to seek another source of income.\nTensions over land and natural resources have been rising for some time, sometimes leading to murderous violence. On Tuesday, Brazilian media reported the killing of an indigenous forest guardian in Maranh\u00e3o. Zezico Rodrigues Guajajara, a teacher and leader, was the fifth member of the Guajarajara community to be murdered since November. The circumstances are now under investigation.\n\u201cI\u2019m the most wanted of the leaders by the invaders and pistoleiros [gunslingers],\u201d he had previously told the journalist and academic Scott Wallace.\nZezico Rodrigues Guajajara was murdered this morning in Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil. Leader and educator who feared for his life and the lives of his people. My notes of our interview in Zutiua on 7.7.17: \"I'm the most wanted of the leaders by the invaders and pistoleiros (gunslingers).\" pic.twitter.com/sdDza2L1yE\nGovernment satellite alerts shows deforestation usually flattens out during the November to March rainy season and then picks up in April ahead of the June to October peak.\nWhether the current situation leads to more deforestation and fire will also depend on other factors. A global economic downturn will probably suppress demand for meat, timber, minerals, soy and other Amazon produce, which could ease pressure on the forest.\nBut this will be countered by the likely domestic recession in Brazil, which could drive more poor people to clear land for subsistence cultivation.\nThe health risks of such invasions are also enormous. Bolsonaro has gone further than Donald Trump in rejecting scientific advice about the need for isolation measures and quarantines to halt the spread of the disease.\nHe has actively encouraged people to flout restrictions put in place by state governors, joined mass rallies of supporters and touted medically unfounded claims about remedies and the innate resistance of Brazilian people.\nThis has been met with international condemnation and particular concern from indigenous groups in Brazil, who have proven horrifyingly vulnerable to previous disease outbreaks. Up to 90% of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas may have been wiped out by measles, smallpox and other diseases brought by European invaders in the 16th and 17th centuries, according to recent studies.\nMany indigenous people are now retreating to their villages in the forest and blocking outside traffic. They have put out an appeal for extra food and medical assistance, and decried the government\u2019s handling of the crisis, which they say has made a bad situation worse.\nAlthough the government has imposed restrictions on visitors to indigenous territory due to health concerns, this could work to the benefit of criminals, said Antonio Oviedo, monitoring coordinator of Brazil\u2019s biggest environmental NGO, Instituto Socioambiental.\n\u201cThere are rules forbidding entry into indigenous lands and conservation areas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut land grabbers, illegal loggers and illegal miners do not follow the rules.\u201d",

        "content": "Continuing our series of writers recommending underseen films available to stream, a shoutout for a suspenseful Hitchcockian thriller from 1997\nBack in 1997, Breakdown wasn\u2019t my \u2013 or any of my friends\u2019 \u2013 first choice when we saw it one Saturday evening at a shopping-mall multiplex in suburban Johannesburg. Whatever shinier blockbuster we had planned to see was sold out. By a process of elimination, factoring in what others had already seen and what a group of 14 year olds could credibly buy tickets for, the sweaty-looking Kurt Russell road thriller with the blunt, unsexy title was the compromise pick. We went in armed with popcorn and moderate enthusiasm. We emerged unexpectedly and excitedly buzzing: the \u201cOh, let\u2019s just see something\u201d option, as it turned, really was something to see.\nI don\u2019t even remember what our first choice was, or if I ever saw it in the end. I do, however, remember Breakdown, fondly and frequently: all too often it\u2019s the film I wish I were viewing for the first time as I sit down to see another Hollywood action spectacle succumb to narrative bloat and synthetic CGI overload. The first theatrical feature by writer-director Jonathan Mostow \u2013 he had made an ignoble straight-to-video debut, Beverly Hills Bodysnatchers, in 1989 \u2013 Breakdown was throwback entertainment even 23 years ago. A studio film with the lean proportions and demands of a 1950s B-movie, with a dependable but faintly on-the-turn leading man, it looked a modest offering beside its blockbuster rivals that spring, including Volcano, The Fifth Element and The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\nYet it topped the US box office for a week that May, fending off Austin Powers for the No 1 spot, en route to a $50m gross on a $36m budget: not exactly a smash, but a solid outcome for a small, largely effects-free genre film that doesn\u2019t reach standard levels of Hollywood bluster until one raucous, 11th-hour car chase that still looks pretty restrained in the era of Fast & Furious [Insert Digit Here].\nPut another way, it was a little engine that could, hinging on a little engine that couldn\u2019t. The setup is savagely clean and quick, indicative of the wholly fat-free proceedings to come. Boston yuppies Jeff (Kurt Russell) and Amy (Kathleen Quinlan) are driving cross-country to set up a new life in San Diego; in a parched stretch of southwestern John Ford desert, they have a near-collision with a local pickup truck and a menacing altercation with its hick drivers at the next petrol station. A few miles on down the remote highway, their engine cuts out; friendly passing trucker Red (JT Walsh) offers to give them a ride to the next diner to call for help. Amy goes, while Jeff stays to mind the car. Turns out he\u2019s guarding the wrong thing: she disappears, and when he catches up with Red, the trucker denies any knowledge of their previous encounter.\nThis is all accomplished in 20 hot, brisk minutes, during which time Mostow\u2019s film cheerfully recalls a wide range of other thriller styles, all of them good: there\u2019s gaslighting suspense of the Hitchcockian variety, townie-versus-redneck friction straight out of Deliverance, the minimalist tarmac menace of Spielberg\u2019s Duel, and even the eerie, godless ambiguity of George Sluizer\u2019s art-horror The Vanishing (the spirit of which this initially honours rather better than Sluizer\u2019s rubbish US remake from 1993).\nGiven all these genre roads to take, it winds up wending its own zig-zag route across them all, only at considerable speed. The initial mystery gives way to nail-digging survival drama, but the tension holds, as Russell\u2019s chino-clad beta male morphs into a never-say-die action man of the most tenacious order. \u201cIt could happen to you,\u201d threatened the film\u2019s poster tagline, which you can buy up to a point: by the time he\u2019s clinging to the underside of a speeding long-haul truck and clawing his way up the carriage, you have to conclude that it probably couldn\u2019t. Still, Russell\u2019s earnestly clenched, intrinsically decent performance \u2013 pulsing and perspiring in such ideal contrast to the late, great Walsh\u2019s unflappable, silver-eyed villain \u2013 keeps you in his tight corner to the ludicrous end.\nBest of all, it\u2019s all wrapped up in 93 minutes, not flagging for one of them, yet not leaving you in need of one more. Breakdown is a modern B-movie that knows its size and station: a rare commodity at a time when Hollywood\u2019s fast-car romps now sprawl as luxuriantly as The English Patient. Mostow went on to bigger things, if not better ones: 2000\u2019s U-571 was an accomplished if anonymous second world war submarine drama, while 2003\u2019s Terminator 3 kicked off a painfully protracted franchise decline. The less said about his 2009 Bruce Willis vehicle Surrogates, the better; nobody has anything to say, meanwhile, about the 2017 Sam Worthington thriller Hunter\u2019s Prayer, which made a grand total of $88,696.\nHe\u2019ll always have Breakdown, though, and so will we. Nobody talks about it much these days, yet when you prod people\u2019s memories, it often wakes dormant affection of the \u201coh yeah, I liked that one\u201d variety. It\u2019s the kind of happy 90s memory you all too often hope to find free to stream and don\u2019t, as their back catalogue dwindles. Finding out they actually have it triggers another old, familiar memory: the feeling of finding your chosen video hasn\u2019t yet been checked out at Blockbusters. Make it your first choice.\nBreakdown is available on Amazon Prime in the US and Netflix in the UK",

He did not exclude further measures, without nominating them.\nThe Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, struck a less optimistic note, warning people not to \u201cget carried away\u201d because although the rate of infection had slowed we were \u201cnot out of the woods\u201d yet.\nAndrews told reporters in Melbourne he still believed that \u201cthere will be a stage four\u201d \u2013 a fuller lockdown leaving only essential services such as grocery stores, petrol and pharmacies open.\nMorrison told reporters people should be patient, and ordered families not to go away on holiday over the Easter break.\nHe said places of worship would be treated as workplaces which respected the four square metre separation rules over the Easter period. Congregations would not be allowed in but could watch online in some cases.\n\u201cIt means there can be additional people taking part in the celebration of these services, not people going to church,\u201d Morrison said, saying the federal government had consulted religious organisations.\nMorrison said national cabinet had agreed to allow working-holiday makers to go to rural and regional areas for fruit picking and harvesting work, if they registered and self-isolated for 14 days before doing so.\nOn Wednesday, Labor\u2019s social services spokesperson, Linda Burney, wrote to the government calling on it to extend coronavirus support to temporary visa holders in Australia, who she said were \u201cfacing hardship and have no other way to support themselves\u201d.\nAsked about further measures to support temporary visa-holders, Morrison replied the acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, would announce further \u201carrangements\u201d in coming days. Guardian Australia understands these relate to relaxing visa conditions, not a new form of payment or special benefit.\nThe prime minister also was firm with visitors on visas, telling them to go home, and claiming that Australia \u201cmust focus on its citizens and its residents\u201d.\nMorrison said national cabinet had agreed to a code of conduct for commercial tenancies, that will be mandatory for businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million that participate in the jobkeeper program.\nThe code would require a \u201ca proportionality to rent reductions based on the decline in turnover to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants\u201d and mediation if they could not agree.\nMorrison suggested the principle of proportionality could be achieved in many ways, such as rent waivers, varying the term of the lease, or the rent.\nAsked why no outcome was announced for residential tenancies, Morrison said the \u201cpriority has been on the commercial tenancies given the business issues involved and the many business closures\u201d.\nGuardian Australia understands that \u2013 in addition to a six-month moratorium on evictions for residential tenants in Covid-19-related financial hardship \u2013 the states and territories are aiming to waive land tax to encourage residential landlords to offer rent reductions.\nUnder the proposal, landlords that offer rent reductions will be able to share the pain 50/50 with the state or territory government, capped at the amount of land tax they pay.\nThe New South Wales treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, told Sky News it was \u201cchallenging in circumstances where every state and territory has different land tax arrangements\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all agreed in principle to provide financial support to landlords who pass on rent reductions to their tenants, whether retail or commercial tenants,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut at the same time \u2026 we need to make sure we have a national approach.\u201d\nWhile those conducting church services will be allowed to attend their workplace, Morrison signalled that parliament would meet only \u201cas it needs during the course of the crisis and it will be done promptly\u201d when it returns to consider the third economic support package on Wednesday.\nLabor is alarmed that parliament has adjourned until August, and the crossbench is increasingly concerned about executive action taken without legislative oversight.\nIn a letter, seen by Guardian Australia, the Greens and much of the crossbench proposed two joint select committees to examine the health and economic responses to Covid-19.\nSigned by the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, independent MPs Helen Haines, Zali Steggall, Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter, and the Centre Alliance\u2019s Rebekha Sharkie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff, the letter complained they had been \u201ceffectively deprived of an important part of our role as parliamentarians\u201d. They warned that \u201cmillions of Australians\u201d who did not vote for the major parties were being locked out of decision-making.\nThe Greens believe they have in-principle support from One Nation, which would be enough to establish a Senate committee.\nAnthony Albanese has said Labor is open to a joint or Senate committee, but the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has warned it should not be a substitute for regular sittings of parliament.\nOn Friday, Morrison said the government \u201cdoesn\u2019t have issues\u201d with proposals to strengthen oversight of the response to Covid-19, suggesting that the \u201cSenate provides very good mechanisms for doing that\u201d.",

The timing is a godsend.\u201d\nThe puppy has helped her children, aged 12 and 15, adjust to life at home in Sevenoaks, Kent, without school, sport or much of a social life.\n\u201cThey entertain each other,\u201d says Brown. \u201cMy daughter would have been bored witless without him. He\u2019s brought structure to the day, and is getting us all outside in the garden.\u201d\nThe benefits of pet ownership for health and wellbeing are well-documented, reducing loneliness and anxiety, lending daily structure, and lifting mood.\nAnd that\u2019s in normal circumstances. In lockdown, pets are proving a lifesaver for many, providing companionship, consistency and even joy.\n\u201cBarney is definitely reducing the stress levels and upping the fun in our house,\u201d says Brown.\nDogs in particular have helped to keep their owners active, demanding daily walks, pandemic or no.\nBethan Taylor-Swaine, who lives in Brixton, south-west London, has been lending her brussels griffon dog, Loki, to her neighbours \u2013 for their benefit, and his.\n\u201cHe\u2019s super social, and he just can\u2019t fathom how he\u2019s gone from essentially being treated like a boy band member to only really seeing me and my husband.\u201d\nAfsaneh Parvizi-Wayne, from Highgate in north London, says Honey, a two-year-old cockapoo, has helped keep her husband sane as he weathers the coronavirus crisis as a hospital consultant.\n\u201cHe walks through the door and she\u2019s waiting for him, and he\u2019s on the floor playing with her. You can visibly see the day\u2019s stress and anxieties diminishing,\u201d Parvizi-Wayne says.\nRachel Conlisk, who lives in Birmingham, says her cats, Belle and Little Tyke, have been a great comfort to her and her 11-year-old son, Sam. \u201cThey\u2019ve been happy having us home \u2013 they\u2019re always on our laps,\u201d says Conlisk.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that when everything\u2019s so crazy out there, it\u2019s been really nice having them around \u2013 they remind you that life goes on.\u201d\nSam says when he has felt worried or sad, cuddling Little Tyke has made him feel better. \u201cShe\u2019s a tabby cat. She\u2019s got a small head and a big body. She sleeps on my bed.\u201d\nConlisk says Little Tyke is \u201creally tolerant\u201d.\nBut it is not only dogs and cats that bring benefits. Alexander Phasey, 18, from Newport in south Wales, says his reptiles have been key to managing his severe social anxiety and depression.\nHe has about 18 animals, including bearded dragons, leopard geckos, corn snakes, tortoises, and monitor lizards, the largest of which is about three-quarters-of-a-metre (2.5ft) long and growing.\nHis \u201cbaby\u201d is Lily, a nine-month-old Argentinian black-and-white tegu \u2013 a large tropical lizard. \u201cI\u2019ve got a proper bond with her. I\u2019ll tap my hand to the floor and she\u2019ll come running out like a puppy, tasting everything with her tongue.\u201d\nCoronavirus has had minimal impact on his ability to care for them, says Phasey, though his pet food supplier is struggling to meet demand from reptile owners stockpiling for their pets: \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of locusts.\u201d\nSome people without pets have seen lockdown as an opportunity to bring one home. Many animal charities have reported an increase in fostering and adoptions, despite most centres being closed to the public.\nBattersea Dogs and Cats Home rehomed 86 dogs and 69 cats in one week in mid-March, more than double the animals placed during the same period last year. One dog, Tulip, had been at the centre for 110 days.\nDogs Trust has reported a 25% increase in adoptions, but warned that \u201ca dog is for life \u2026 not just for lockdown\u201d.\n\u201cWe really need people to think about what might happen on the other side of this outbreak when people are hopefully back to their usual routines and have other commitments,\u201d said the trust\u2019s operations director, Adam Clowes.\nSome animals appear to be struggling with the disruption to their routines. Livi Perkins, a pet sitter in Rock Ferry, Wirral, has been put out of work by the pandemic and says a client sent her footage of their dog reacting to a video Perkins posted on Instagram. \u201cShe heard my voice and ran around looking for me.\u201d\nCaroline Wilkinson, an animal behaviorist and dog trainer near Bristol, says dogs in particular can become needy or prone to barking with their humans more available.\nShe recommends keeping their mealtimes and bedtimes consistent, and ensuring they have some time by themselves. Dogs may even need \u201ca rest day\u201d from all the exercise.\nFor now, many pets are relishing their owners\u2019 extra attention and new enthusiasm for walks. Brown \u2013 who has always worked from home, as a website designer \u2013 worries for Barney, who will have never known any other life.\n\u201cWhen this is all over, and everybody goes back to work and school, I\u2019m going to have a dog that is suddenly wondering where everybody has gone.\u201d",

        "content": "Bellevue hospital in Manhattan has fought against epidemics for centuries, but workers say they can see a breaking point coming as coronavirus cases rise\nFrontline medical workers at one of New York\u2019s best resourced and most prestigious public hospitals have warned the facility is in critical need of nursing staff, protective equipment, ventilators and medicines to cope with the rising number of coronavirus cases in New York City.\nStaff at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan, the oldest public hospital in the US, have been warned not to speak to the media, except with explicit approval. But medical workers told the Guardian on condition of anonymity that they were concerned about what would happen as cases continue to rise.\n\u201cWe are heading towards a situation where we will run out of ventilators,\u201d said one doctor at the hospital working on the Covid-19 response. \u201cI hope that this surge isn\u2019t as bad as we predict.\u201d\nBellevue hospital has been the battleground for epidemics for centuries \u2013 yellow fever in the 1700s, cholera in the 1800s and Aids in the 1980s. It even successfully treated New York City\u2019s lone case of the Ebola virus in 2014. But little could have prepared Bellevue for Covid-19.\nArguably one of the best-positioned public hospitals in the nation to deal with the pandemic, Bellevue normally has more than 800 beds and support from New York University (NYU). For the past few weeks, it has made sweeping changes to staff numerous new Covid-19 wards at the hospital, as well as the existing emergency room and ICUs.\nPhysicians and nurses normally working in clinical outpatient settings are now working in screening tents, and the hospital is deploying surgeons and other specialists to work across the hospital wards. NYC Health + Hospital System, which oversees Bellevue and 10 other public hospitals in the city, announced that the hospital will receive 52 more ICU beds, and more frontline staff in coming days.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting better coordinated by the day,\u201d said Dave Chokshi, a primary care physician at Bellevue and vice-president at New York Health + Hospitals. \u201cWithin our system, Bellevue is one of the most advanced hospitals with respect to the range of services it offers. It does end up being a place where the sickest patients go.\u201d\nThe hospital has also pared back other inpatient services to make room for coronavirus patients \u2013 regular appointments and clinics are canceled. And telemedicine has surged from 50 patients a day to 3,000 a day at NYU.\nHealth workers said they still see a breaking point ahead. \u201cSo many people working in direct care are getting sick,\u201d said a hospital physician. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still rationing masks.\u201d\nLike many hospitals in the country, several staffers outside of the emergency room at Bellevue said they currently have only the lowest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) available \u2013 surgical masks \u2013 and are not allowed to bring the more protective N95 masks to work, even if they have them at home.\nEmergency medicine residents at Bellevue hospital asked for money on GoFundMe to obtain N95 respirator masks. They raised more than $120,000, and obtained 10,000 masks for the emergency department and intensive care unit. Health workers said they\u2019ve seen more supplies delivered recently, but still worry that will not sustain them through the peak of Covid-19 infections, And some have reportedly quit or taken leave as a result.\nMeanwhile, droves of potential patients wait in tents outside Bellevue, where they are triaged for tests, including sick service workers from nearby restaurants needing a letter from a doctor not to work. Most, however, will not receive a Covid-19 test \u2013 a nationwide lack of swabs and reagent, a liquid essential to the test, has limited testing at Bellevue and its sister hospitals to only the critically ill patients in ICUs and frontline health workers.\nCity officials project every hospital bed in New York City \u2013 20,000 in normal circumstances \u2013 will need to be transformed into critical care beds to care for Covid-19 patients on ventilators.\nInside the wards, physicians in the system said Bellevue has a critical need for more ventilators as the weeks go on, and is on track for running out by the end of the week. Last week this urgency led the hospital, like others, to form an ethics committee to decide which patients receive a ventilator or other treatments, should they need to ration equipment. \u201cIt was quite scary,\u201d one physician said.\nNew York is expected to need 15,000 to 18,000 ventilators at the peak if the rate of people getting sick does not decrease, but it currently has fewer than 10,000. New York\u2019s mayor, Bill De Blasio, has urged private practices and even veterinarians to loan ventilators to the city, measures he said need to be in place by Sunday.\nAnd federal health officials on Tuesday advised hospitals to retrofit anesthesia machines as ventilators, and to double up patients with similar oxygen needs on to a single ventilator as a last resort.\n\u201cThe availability of precious medical resources will be limited in some places because of the numbers of patients and their severity of illness,\u201d said Adm Brett P Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, about current projections.\nEven in these dire circumstances, Bellevue staff told the Guardian that the hospital is in better position than others in the city, and has not yet reached full capacity. One physician working in the wards said there was no need for more physicians or beds at the moment, but expected that there would be in coming days.\nBellevue is also known for taking care of a diverse range of patients, including significant populations of low-income New Yorkers and immigrant communities. It\u2019s entire 19th floor is a prison ward for men at Rikers Island, where officials have warned that coronavirus cases are rising dramatically.\nLike other hospitals in the public system, it is accepting patients from other hospitals like Elmhurst hospital in Queens, and Lincoln medical center, in the Bronx, as they run out of beds and resources.\n\u201cBellevue always hemorrhages money but it\u2019s the stopgap \u2013 it\u2019s the hospital that takes patients others won\u2019t admit,\u201d said David Oshinsky, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone, who chronicled the hospital\u2019s history in his book Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America\u2019s Most Storied Hospital.\nAcross the city, 250 ambulances and 500 nurses have been brought to New York. The USNS Comfort, a navy hospital ship with capacity for 1,000 beds has docked at New York Harbor to treat non-Covid-19 patients. The Billie Jean King tennis center is being transformed into a 350-bed overflow for Elmhurst hospital, another public hospital in the Health + Hospital System in Queens, home to roughly one-third of the cases in the five boroughs of the city.\nThe death toll across the city, and at the hospital, however, is rising. Outside Bellevue, the city\u2019s chief medical examiner has set up massive tents and refrigerator trucks to handle a surge in deaths. And inmates at Rikers Island are now being offered $6 an hour to dig temporary mass graves on Hart Island, at a city-run cemetery.\nAs Bellevue\u2019s physicians and staff prepare for the peak of Covid-19 patients, they are hoping that the hospital will be able to draw on its past and curb the city\u2019s death and disease.\n\u201cOur house staff is superbly trained \u2013 they\u2019re also used to this in ways other hospitals may not be,\u201d Oshinsky said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a history of epidemics when all hands on deck were needed at Bellevue.\u201d",

        "content": "Health restrictions have already hit some long-term projects but routine monitoring could be affected if the pandemic drags on\nThe coronavirus pandemic has stalled scientific fieldwork and may even start to affect the monitoring of the climate, scientists have warned.\nMajor projects to gather environmental data have been postponed or canceled over concerns that teams of researchers working together will spread the Covid-19 virus.\nThe crisis has so far mainly stymied long-term studies, but concerns have been raised that routine monitoring of weather and the climate crisis may be affected if the pandemic drags on for an extended period.\nPetteri Taalas, secretary general of World Meteorological Organization, said: \u201cThe impacts of climate change and growing amount of weather-related disasters continue.\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge, and may exacerbate multi-hazard risks at a single-country level. Therefore it is essential that governments pay attention to their national early warning and weather-observing capacities despite the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d\nWealthy countries that have deployed land- and ocean-based instruments, as well as satellites, to gauge temperature changes and other readings mostly have done so with fully or partly automated systems.\nThis means that data will continue to flow without much hands-on human input but should the pandemic stretch out for many more weeks then missed repairs and replacements of instruments will become an \u201cincreasing concern\u201d, according to the WMO.\nFurthermore, in many developing countries measurements are routinely taken manually by scientists in the field and there are indications this work has dropped off.\nA huge slump in air travel since the start of the pandemic has dented the collection of ambient temperature and wind speed taken in-flight by sensors fitted to commercial airliners through an initiative called the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay program. A coalition of national weather services across Europe are discussing how to compensate for the decrease in the 700,000 climate observations normally provided per day by aircraft.\nIn the US, a swath of climate research work has been called off or delayed. Nasa-led missions to survey the loss of land in the Mississippi River delta and hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico have been suspended. With all flights to and from Greenland suspended, a project to collect cores from the country\u2019s vast ice sheet has been voided for the year.\nNasa has asked staff to work remotely where possible, with a spokesman telling the Guardian that the agency has a continuity plan to ensure that there is \u201cno interruption of climate-relevant data\u201d.\nA five-year Nasa project to study the impact of severe thunderstorms that enter the stratosphere is now mired in uncertainty. Researchers from several universities have partnered with Nasa to use its high-altitude ER-2 aircraft to take measurements this summer but this work is now on hold.\n\u201cBecause of the delays we haven\u2019t started tests yet and it\u2019s not clear if we are going to be able to do that,\u201d said Kenneth Bowman, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, who is working on the project. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know the timings, we are taking it week to week. It\u2019s always frustrating having all of your plans disrupted, not knowing when we will do what we want to do.\u201d\nBowman said routine climate monitoring is \u201crobust\u201d and that he would be surprised if the pandemic disrupted this work unless it spooled out for many months or years.\nGabriel Vecchi, a climate modeler at Princeton University, said while he was concerned about the impact of the pandemic on data collection he was \u201cquite heartened\u201d that observations of the Earth\u2019s surface have continued unabated so far.\n\u201cWe should all be grateful for the people and organizations that are continuing these essential forecast and monitoring operations, in spite of the severe challenges they are facing,\u201d he said.\nIf the pandemic lingers then climate scientists will face challenges shared by some other professions \u2013 meetings of teams will have to be reorientated, the maintenance of equipment will somehow have to be done and trips to research sites will be curtailed.\nThis is occurring at a time when air pollution, as well as planet-heating gases, has declined considerably in China and Europe due to a reduction in human activity.\n\u201cFor the most part these polluted areas have snuck up on people and they have become the norm and when the public realize it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, I can imagine considerable pressures to not let it go back to how it was,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, a veteran climate scientist.\n\u201cI can imagine that commuting from home may become a lot more common as we move ahead, to the advantage of the climate system and fossil fuel use, and to everyone.\u201d",

        "content": "The Upside succumbs to coronavirus positivity: silver linings, survivor stories and funny interludes\nLast week we began with a paradox. This week we have another for you which we have shamelessly borrowed from our fellow travellers at Christian Science Monitor:\nIt\u2019s one of the paradoxes of the coronavirus crisis: Local papers are going under even as both readership and public need for solid information soar. With advertisers pulling out, can other financial models offer hope?\nWe feel the paradox keenly at the Guardian as well. So I will do you a deal: if you will consider putting something in the tipbox this week that roughly equates to what you feel this newsletter is worth, we will give you more Upside news than we\u2019ve ever given you before.\nHere goes:\n The people who recovered from Covid-19. Two-minute read.\n Businesses move into ventilator overdrive. 90-second read.\n The African migrants helping to feed Italy. Two-minute snack.\n The great hope for our oceans. About 30 years.\n How to be isolated: a guide to surviving lockdown, by the people who are good at being alone. Three-minute read.\n How the crisis is reviving our utopian hopes of connection and community 90-second OpEd piece.\n How to manage Covid-19 anxiety. Two minutes.\n A new mini-series: hope in a time of crisis. Daily fix.\nAnd in non-coronavirus Upside news:\n The best schools in Brazil Three-minute read.\n How to stop flooding Three-minute read.\n Our best long reads ever. An hour or two.\n The antidote \u2013 most read non-Covid tales. Quick browse.\n New blood test can detect 50 types of cancer. One-minute read.\nFinally, two of the funniest stories of the week. The first involves a man, some magnets and a pair of very sore nostrils.\nThe second is pure internet gold.\nDefence budgets are likely to be a secondary victim of the Covid-19 pandemic. Jane\u2019s, a defence thinktank, reckons spending could be reduced by tens of billions of pounds around the world as a result of the virus.\nAndrew MacDonald, a Jane\u2019s analyst said:\n\u201cDefence spending plans in a series of the world\u2019s largest defence markets are on course to be derailed in the near-term by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\nThis piece in the Conversation asked whether the virus might kill off the global wildlife trade.\nWe were humbled by the sports stars who realised there is another kind of heroism, people like Jos Buttler, Marcus Rashford and the Barcelona football team.\nThis piece in the Atlantic is beautiful: the chance to regain a less hurried life.\nWe admired the Boston Globe\u2019s new initiative to connect people in need with people who are able to help. And the LA Times piece on the festival hands now building Covid triage units.\nGiven that we cannot travel at the moment and are restless for new vistas, we also liked this attempt to digitally recreate ruined castles of Europe by NeoMam Studios.\nAnd finally there were bouncy rubber pavements, which we thought might have been an early April fool, until it emerged that April Fool\u2019s Day was largely cancelled this year.\nWith so many of us restricted in our movements, the life-in-lockdown stories have been pouring in. Keep them coming.\nLesley Freedman wrote in from lockdown in Sydney\nWe celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary last week in Sydney. It was a covid news-free day! My partner and I rediscovered our wedding photos and watched the video for the first time right through. In the evening we dressed up and connected with four of our special guests online. We wore silly hats, popped champagne on cue and offered each other olives and cheese. For the first time in days we were happy.\nAdam Mileusnic has also been indoors, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from doing miles on his bike\n\n  I\u2019m a British guy living in Madrid and have been quarantined in my flat for 15 days now.\nI livestreamed an eight-hour cycling challenge on my exercise bike for a group of 36 children\u2019s charities affected by the Covid crisis (collectively called Family for Every Child) and raised over \u00a31,000.\nI came up with the idea after being trapped for so long with only one way to keep moving!\nYou too could emulate Adam\u2019s heroics. Check out connectandride.org.\nOn balconies everywhere, which are finding a new purpose in life.\nThese are extraordinary times, dear reader \u2013 let us know how it is for you.

According to one expert, however, it is also possible that substantial wage bills could hinder the Premier League\u2019s ability to bounce back after the crisis, leaving leading players as easy pickings for rival leagues.\n\u201cThey have to agree player wage reductions; that has to occur,\u201d said James Barford of Enders Analysis, author of a recent report into the effects of Covid-19 on the football industry. \u201cBut if the agreed temporary wage reductions are not adequate, there could be problems.\u201d\nThis week Barcelona players announced they were taking a temporary 70% cut in their pay. According to Lionel Messi the decision was made in order to \u201cfind a formula to support the club\u201d. Players at Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have made similar efforts, and Juventus\u2019s first team have agreed to freeze their pay.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/02-57075-gnl.fw.200402.jf.PhilippeAuclair.mp3\nAs the Premier League\u2019s rivals have taken action, English clubs continue to pay out wages that in several cases \u2013 according to the most recent accounts \u2013 equate to 75% of revenue, most of which has suddenly come to a halt.\n\u201cIf the reductions aren\u2019t sufficient but they are in other big football clubs and other big leagues in the world, then the only other option to avert bankruptcy for many Premier League clubs will be to sell their players,\u201d Barford said.\n\u201cThey could be forced even to sell them at cut prices, perhaps to the Chinese Super League or to rivals in Europe that have got their act together.\u201d\nThe PFA is believed to have resisted direct calls from the Premier League to consider wage cuts, preferring an arrangement which would defer wages. The union is thought to be sceptical that savings from cuts won\u2019t be used to finance clubs\u2019 future dealings in the transfer market.\nPressure is set to come to a head at Friday\u2019s shareholder\u2019s meeting, but if a solution can be found, Barford believes the Premier League can expect to return with a decent bill of health.\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt the Premier League\u2019s ability to bounce back,\u201d he said, \u201cprovided the players are there and clubs are still solvent. People still want to see football and they are missing it.\u201d",

They ran a small practice, knowing all their patients, each being \u201con-call\u201d alternate nights and weekends, rather than using any deputising service. Throughout her life, ex-patients remained in touch.\nThe daughter of Nellie (nee Hosegood) and Christopher Bennett, Monica was the middle of five children growing up on their father\u2019s farm near Louth, Lincolnshire. She went to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1942, one of a handful of women among a sea of men studying medicine, graduated in 1945 and qualified as a doctor in 1948.\nShe returned to Cambridge in 1949 after marrying Tony Shutter, assistant under-librarian at the university library. She took locum GP jobs while her children were young, and she cared for them; and later for Tony, who died in March 1959, at 38, of diabetes-related kidney failure.\nIn 1960 Monica began her long work partnership with Betty, and they became well-loved family GPs, nurturing doctor-patient relationships to promote health and find the best treatment for individuals. She was interested in the connection between physical and mental health and studied this with the psychoanalyst Dr Michael Balint, learning from him for years.\nShe was the regular doctor for the Cyrenians charity and for Jimmy\u2019s homeless shelter, volunteering with both organisations, and other health-related groups, for decades. She was a member of the Community Health Council until its abolition, and an early member of the Green party, deeply concerned about humanity\u2019s dangerous effects on the planet.\nMonica was a committed Christian and active in Wesley Methodist Church, which she joined as an undergraduate. She was a local preacher for over 50 years, retiring from that service only in 2010. She led the primary department of the Sunday school through the 1960s and was a member of the oversight committee of Wesley House, training future Methodist ministers.\nAfter retirement in 1990, Monica followed many courses at U3A (the University of the Third Age), in subjects as diverse as geology, archaeology and comparative religion. She loved caring for her granddaughters and getting to know her great-grandchildren.\nCambridge had not allowed women to graduate before 1948, and finally acted to remedy the injustice 50 years later. Monica was pleased to join some 900 other women in the 1998 ceremony finally awarding them their degrees.\nMonica\u2019s three children, Pip, Tim and me, her three granddaughters, Katie, Rosanna and Amy, three great-grandchildren, Imogen, Dylan and Otis, and her youngest sister, Josephine, survive her.",

        "content": "Dead bodies kept in homes or dumped on roadsides as authorities and hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19 in Andean nation\u2019s second city\nDemocratic leaders given poll boost for handling of crisis\nIt has been three days since Reynaldo Barrezueta passed away at his home in Ecuador\u2019s biggest city \u2013 and still his body lies in a coffin on the sitting room floor.\n\u201cThe authorities are just leaving us to die,\u201d said his son, Eduardo Javier Barrezueta Ch\u00e1vez, who has spent the last 72 hours pleading with authorities remove his father\u2019s corpse \u2013 so far to no avail.\nBarrezueta is not alone. In recent days the coronavirus has swept into Guayaquil with deadly force, overwhelming local authorities, funeral homes and hospitals and leaving families such as his facing unthinkable horrors.\nPhotographs and video footage emerging from this crisis-stricken coastal city look like images from the aftermath of a natural disaster: bodies wrapped in sheets and dumped on the roadside or outside houses; desperate families begging for help after being forced to keep their loved-ones corpses at home for days in temperatures of more than 30C.\n\u201cThey\u2019re leaving them in the streets, on the pavements, abandoned at home,\u201d tweeted the city\u2019s mayor, Cynthia Viteri, herself now in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19. \u201cWhat is going on in Guayaquil?\u201d\nBarrezueta, a 33-year-old odd-job man from the city\u2019s south, has had a front row seat to the dystopia, which many fear offers a terrible glimpse of the future for other Latin American cities as coronavirus accelerates its march across the region.\nHis 57-year-old father fell ill on 18 March, a week after Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, declared a nationwide coronavirus emergency and nearly three weeks after the country\u2019s first confirmed case.\nFor five days Reynaldo Barrezueta suffered body and headaches before appearing to improve. But last Thursday Barrezueta said his father deteriorated, developing a ferocious cough, and was taken to Guayaquil\u2019s Monte Sina\u00ed hospital where a chest x-ray suggested he was suffering from pneumonia caused by Covid-19.\nBarrezueta claimed swamped health workers told him they had no room to admit his father and they returned home with instructions to treat him with paracetamol. At about 6am on Monday he woke with chest pains and breathing difficulties before dying in front of his family, apparently from a heart attack.\nOn Thursday lunchtime, more than three days later, his body was still there \u2013 a black binbag draped over the coffin in a futile attempt to conceal the growing stench of decomposition.\nIn a desperate bid to attract the attention of authorities, the victim\u2019s son posted a video on social media in which he kneels down beside the casket, wearing a yellow face mask, and begs: \u201cPlease, I\u2019m on my knees asking you to come and help me\u201d.\nBut so far \u2013 with the city\u2019s morgue reportedly full and corpse collectors overwhelmed by the sheer number of dead \u2013 no one has.\nFernando Jim\u00e9nez, the owner of one local funeral parlour, said he had closed his business because it was impossible to secure burial slots at the cemetery. \u201cThere was so much emergency demand that we couldn\u2019t cope,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is really out of control.\u201d\nA report in one local newspaper, Expreso, suggested the tragedy was only just beginning. \u201cThe situation is going to get even worse,\u201d it predicted on Thursday as Ecuador\u2019s government said it expected Guayaquil would suffer up to 3,500 deaths in the coming months.\nSo far, few Latin American countries have been worse affected by coronavirus than Ecuador \u2013 and nowhere has been worse hit than Guayaquil where nearly half of the country\u2019s 3,163 confirmed cases have been recorded.\nExperts say one explanation is the high levels of air traffic between Ecuador and Spain, which is home to more than 400,000 Ecuadorian migrants and which has the world\u2019s second-highest death toll from the disease. The first Covid-19 case recorded in the South American country was of a 71-year-old woman who flew into Guayaquil from Madrid in mid-February and died there on 13 March.\nOthers suspect Ecuador\u2019s failure to quickly impose and enforce effective quarantine measures may have played a role, although the government rejects that charge.\nThe port city\u2019s plight has sent shockwaves across a region where many already fragile health systems are now bracing for a similar wave of patients and deaths.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not time to snooze. It\u2019s time to get ready,\u201d El Salvador\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, tweeted this week, pointing to Guayaquil\u2019s calamity as proof.\n\u201cThey said the pandemic wouldn\u2019t be so bad in Latin America because we\u2019re used to illness, because it\u2019s hot, because our population\u2019s young,\u201d added Bukele, who has ordered some of the region\u2019s fastest and strictest anti-Covid measures. \u201cBut just look at what is happening in Ecuador.\u201d\nPie de P\u00e1gina, a Mexican news website, warned: \u201cFor the rest of the world, Guayaquil is a nightmare that could come true\u201d.\nFor Barrezueta and his 30-year-old wife, Katiuska Castro, it is an ordeal that is still playing out. As they sat at home with his Reynaldo\u2019s cadaver on Thursday, the father-of-two said grief would have to wait.\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a huge loss. He\u2019s my dad. We feel awful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re getting sick ourselves now. We\u2019ve got all the symptoms \u2026 diarrhoea, fever \u2026 muscle aches. And we can\u2019t go to the hospital because if you go to the hospital you just get more infected and they won\u2019t see you anyway.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been here in the sitting room for three days and my family is getting infected,\u201d complained Barrezueta, who has sent his two sons \u2013 aged two and four \u2013 to stay with relatives to get them out of danger.\nEcuador\u2019s official coronavirus death toll now stands at 120, some 82 of which were recorded in the province of Guayas, of which Guayaquil is the capital.\nBut Barrezueta, like many here, said he suspected the true figure was far higher.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through a very difficult situation here right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president isn\u2019t here. He\u2019s hiding. We don\u2019t know where he is. We\u2019ve got no mayor. No governor. We\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaos. There\u2019s no-one to help us. We are afraid,\u201d Barrezueta later added in a WhatsApp message. \u201cPlease. We need help. We are dying here and nobody is doing anything.\u201d",

        "content": "Coronavirus crisis has decimated food service \u2013 and apps still probably won\u2019t be enough to keep many small businesses alive\nCalifornia restaurants were some of the first in the US to close in order to stem the spread of the coronavirus. And in the food service industry\u2019s crisis, third-party delivery platforms have found great opportunity.\nAs businesses have been forced to close their dining rooms amid shelter-in-place orders, many have attempted a quick pivot to takeout and delivery. Without a physical presence in their customers\u2019 lives, many restaurants\u2019 immediate survival has come to depend on a digital one, shifting power and control from business owners to third-party technology companies that take large commission fees on every order. It has meant a boon for platforms such as UberEats and DoorDash, rare corporate winners in an accelerating unemployment crisis and recession that has decimated food service \u2013 though the apps probably still won\u2019t be enough to keep many small businesses alive.\nThird-party delivery platforms frame their business as one of marketing. When restaurants still had dining rooms to fill, apps promoted their service as a way of reaching new customers. Now the platforms hold the restaurant market captive, and the apps are more crowded than ever.\nOn the consumer side, the deals look great: UberEats is dropping delivery fees to drive more demand. Grubhub is offering a special \u201cSupper for Support\u201d $10 discount to qualifying customer orders every evening.\nBut restaurants are left to pick up the tab, as Grubhub\u2019s usual commission is still calculated on the pre-discount total. From company to company, those commissions can range from 15% to as high as 35% of order totals.\nUberEats has waived activation fees for new restaurants, but has declined to reduce commissions. Grubhub has temporarily deferred but not waived or reduced commissions for some independent restaurants.\nStill, many struggling restaurants have no choice but to give in and sign up. Grubhub reports more than 10 to 15 times the usual onboarding requests from new restaurants, with four to five times more new businesses added to the app on a regular basis. \u201cWe know these are tough times for independent restaurants because people are not eating out. Our mission here is to help keep their doors open,\u201d Grubhub said in a statement.\nFaced with shutting her doors for the first time in over 20 years, Rachel Herbert, the owner of four Park Cafes across San Francisco and Oakland, took her chances on tech. \u201cThe first place we turned to was the third-party delivery companies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at what we need to do to keep our doors open, we have to remember that 30% of the revenue we\u2019re taking in is going to go to third-party delivery. They\u2019re experiencing a boom. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019re grateful for the service. But it sure would be nice if they reduced those fees.\u201d\nHerbert says sales are down 80% across her cafes, which relied on neighborhood foot traffic. \u201cWe\u2019re not really breaking even, but we\u2019re keeping our doors open, so we\u2019re making enough to pay the people who are working and providing that service for the neighborhoods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of survival.\u201d\nLos Angeles restaurant owner and consultant Adam Weisblatt often tells his clients that third-party delivery is a good tool for short-term cashflow \u2013 but not for profit.\n\u201cThe delivery fees and service charges from these websites are murder. They\u2019re incredibly high rates,\u201d said Weisblatt. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to profit at all.\u201d\nWeisblatt has temporarily shuttered his oyster bar, and kept his Thai restaurant Same-Same open for takeout and delivery on several third-party platforms.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing quite a bit of delivery and to-go, but that\u2019s always been a significant portion of our business. Still, Same-Same is going to lose money every month \u2013 we just don\u2019t know quite how much yet,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese sites live off of restaurants, they need us to survive. But I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve been especially supportive of the industry. They\u2019re not proving to be good partners right now,\u201d Weisblatt added. \u201cIt feels like a very shortsighted decision not to be helpful, and that as soon as business returns to normal, people are going to look to really eliminate these things.\u201d\nSome restaurants, many of them totally new to takeout and delivery, have attempted to make that leap already, deciding to go it alone and platform-free. That means keeping more of their profits, but expending more labor along the way, from wrangling orders as they come in to launching new DIY delivery fleets.\nS+M Vegan relied on catering and regular pop-ups at bars in the Bay Area before the shelter-in-place order took effect. Plans for their brick and mortar, set to open later this summer, have fallen through. Now they have switched to twice-weekly meal pickups from their commercial kitchen.\n\u201cThe advantage is we can do it by ourselves. Third-party delivery apps are known for being kind of a scam,\u201d said co-owner Marie Chia. \u201cThe most successful restaurants run on a margin of about 6%, so the more people order from you, the more you\u2019re losing money. We don\u2019t need to be giving over 30% of our already very small margins.\u201d\nWith only two owner-operators, S+M is too short-staffed to run delivery orders \u2013 but turning to an app for help is not an option.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to maximize what we can get out of this and the value that we can give to our customers,\u201d said co-owner Shane Stanbridge. \u201cIf we were taking a 15% to 30% chunk out of our margins, we might feel tempted to inflate our prices to make up for it. That\u2019s just so unnecessary.\u201d\nCalifornia\u2019s Alcohol Control Board loosened restrictions on restaurants selling liquor to-go, which has helped fill the gap for some businesses, with the margins on drinks typically wider than on food.\nOakland\u2019s Kon-Tiki bar and restaurant began delivery service the day the new rules were announced, doing about half their usual business, said co-owner Matt Reagan. Ultimately he decided against using third-party platforms. The operation has gone old-school, with a menu available online, but orders made over the phone. \u201cWe give people the expectation up front that takeout is your best option \u2013 we can get you delivery but it\u2019s going to be a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like time traveling to 15 years ago and you\u2019re just waiting for your pizza to show up.\u201d\nFor now, it\u2019s enough to pay some bills, and allow Kon-Tiki to hire back some staff. Plans to open another Oakland restaurant, Palmetto, are continuing apace, though with a to-go only grand opening planned for April. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a market there. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big market, it just has to be something,\u201d said Reagan. \u201cFor now, there\u2019s a path forward. People are making a conscious effort to support the places that they want to survive.\u201d\nBut as the nation slips deeper into a coronavirus recession, no one knows if consumers will be able to afford to keep up that kind of support \u2013 or if it will be enough to save the industry. In a National Restaurant Association poll of more than 5,000 restaurant owners, 11% said they would probably permanently close in the next 30 days, and 3% reported that they had already closed for good.\n\u201cWe all want to have the lights on and people employed and be open for the day of the victory parade,\u201d said Reagan. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s going to be a lot fewer restaurants when that day comes \u2013 a lot of neighborhood staples that aren\u2019t going to be able to make it through to the end.\u201d",

        "content": "The world No 1, whose title defence may be delayed to 2021 after the Candidates was suspended, has launched an eight-player event with a prize fund of $250,000\nMagnus Carlsen, the world champion, aims to fill the void from the cancellation of over-the-board chess by launching an online super-tournament, starting on 18 April, where he will compete against seven of his major rivals, including the world Nos 2 and 3, Fabiano Caruana of the US and Ding Liren of China, for a $250,000 prize fund, easily a record for internet chess.\nThe Magnus Carlsen Invitational is set to go ahead online at the website chess24.com. Invitees are Carlsen and seven other elite GMs, including Caruana and Ding, it will last until 2 May, and its format will be an all-play-all group stage of four-game mini-matches. Competitors will have 15 minutes for each game, plus 10 seconds for each move made. The top four players in the round robin will then compete in the knockout stage for the $70,000 first prize.\nA tournament of this scale online has never been organised before, and could revolutionise the sport. Several anti-cheating measures will be in force, including mandatory cameras viewing the players. There are also plans for online chess fans to get the chance to play the top competitors and the world champion himself. Every game will be broadcast online by chess24.com with expert commentary in nine languages.\nSeveral million players already take part in online chess on three major websites. Interest has spiked in recent weeks due to people being forced to stay at home because of global lockdowns. Try it for yourself! For newcomers, I recommend lichess, where you can very quickly select your own time limit, find an opponent, and play a game all for free.\nCarlsen\u2019s new move comes amid continued controversy over the eight-player Candidates to decide the Norwegian\u2019s next challenger, which was aborted in Ekaterinburg last week after seven of its 14 rounds. France\u2019s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave was leading on tie-break from Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi.\nArkady Dvorkovich took a personal decision \u201cafter just a few seconds of thinking\u201d to suspend play last Thursday when he learned that international flights out of Russia would be banned from the next day. The global body Fide\u2019s president feared that the grandmasters from China, France, the Netherlands and the US would be stranded indefinitely.\nThis is the third time in the last half-century that a Fide president has had to make such a decision, and the consequences of the previous two were momentous. In July 1972 Max Euwe bent the rules to allow Bobby Fischer to arrive late in Reykjavik to play Boris Spassky. The match still nearly foundered at the start, but Euwe\u2019s judgment was vindicated when Fischer\u2019s victory led to the greatest boom chess has ever known.\nIn February 1985 the Fide president Florencio Campomanes stopped the first Anatoly Karpov v Garry Kasparov in Moscow when Karpov led 5-3 in a race to six wins but had just lost two in a row. It probably came after pressure from Soviet officials who feared that the exhausted Karpov would collapse, even though both players said they wanted to continue. The match was replayed later in 1985, Kasparov won, but he ceased to trust Fide and in 1993 he and Nigel Short launched a breakaway organisation which split the chess world for 12 years.\nEvents proved that Campomanes probably got it wrong. Now in 2020 Dvorkovich seems not to have seriously considered continuing the Candidates until its scheduled finishing date of 4 April. There were stringent medical precautions in place, and thus a good chance that the event could have been concluded normally. Dvorkovich is a former deputy prime minister of Russia, and would have been in a position to pull strings in Moscow for a request to lift the flying ban for a single chartered flight to take the players out of Russia.\nDvorkovich and Fide still plan to complete the Candidates, again in Ekaterinburg, later this year, but what if coronavirus persists for a long time? The world title match was scheduled for December 2020 at Expo Dubai, an event which now seems likely to be postponed until 2021. It would not be surprising if the conclusion of the Candidates was also to be delayed for 12 months, as all concerned still want the match to take place in Dubai.\nTeimour Radjabov qualified for the Candidates, withdrew citing virus fears, and now demands to be included if and when it continues. The Azerbaijani has many supporters, but Fide will not agree and the matter could end up in the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne.\nCarlsen, for his part, seems to be enjoying the argument: \u201cRegardless of what happens, I\u2019m not a victim. If I get to play a match that would be fun, it would be interesting, and if I get to sit on the title a bit more I\u2019m not going to complain.\u201d\n3665 1 gxh5!

Details are still unclear for those taking BTec and vocational or technical qualifications at schools and colleges.\nExperts have cautioned that relying on teacher assessments is likely to penalise students from disadvantaged backgrounds, according to Jo Grady, the secretary general of the University and College Union.\n\u201cOur primary concern is that disadvantaged students are the ones most likely to miss out. Research shows that they fare badly when it comes to predicted grades and they are less likely to be able to put life on hold and delay sitting exams, or have access to the tools required to navigate any appeals system,\u201d Grady said.\nDaisy Christodoulou, the director of education at the assessment organisation No More Marking, said Ofqual\u2019s system was likely to lessen at least some potential sources of bias.\n\u201cWe are in unprecedented times and given the impossibility of holding exams it is hard to see what else could have been done. Ofqual\u2019s requirement for a grade and rank order seems like the best information they could require at the moment and will at least help to iron out inconsistencies between centres,\u201d she said.\nSally Collier, the chief regulator of Ofqual, said: \u201cWe have worked closely with the teaching profession to ensure that what we are asking is both appropriate and manageable, so that everyone can have confidence in the approach.\u201d\nIn a message to students, Collier said: \u201cThe grades you get this summer will look exactly the same as in previous years, and they will have equal status with universities, colleges and employers, to help you move forward in your lives.\u201d\nHamid Patel, the chief executive of the Star Academies group, said Ofqual\u2019s announcement was fair and involved a minimum of bureaucracy, but he raised concerns about pupils taking GCSEs a year early in year 10. Ofqual is consulting on whether they sit the exams next year instead of being awarded a grade for their work this year.\n\u201cClearly we would have all wanted the examination season this summer to continue as planned,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, that is not possible as we have a duty first and foremost to ensure the wellbeing and safety of pupils, families and staff, including saving lives.\u201d\nUnder Ofqual\u2019s system, schools will be asked to recommend a grade for pupils in each subject, and to \u201crank order\u201d candidates within each grade, from the pupil the school is most confident about receiving that grade to the least. The assessments will be kept confidential and not shared with individual students.\nEach candidate\u2019s final grade will be assigned by the exam boards using a model under development by Ofqual, using the prior attainment of the year group at each school and college, each centre\u2019s exam performance in recent years and the expected national outcomes for all pupils.\nThe regulator said schools would submit their assessments to the exam boards from 29 May, and that it hoped to publish the final grades on or before the usual mid-August results season.\nOfqual\u2019s announcement left questions still to be answered, however, including how appeals against final grades will be conducted and when students will have an opportunity to \u201cre-sit\u201d their exams next year.\nThe regulator said it was still considering how to award grades for external candidates, those taking the exams without a formal affiliation, such as students being home-schooled.\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the move was pragmatic and avoided extra burdens on schools.\n\u201cOf course this is not a seamless solution. Students will have been expecting to go through a very different process. However, their grades will now be determined by the professionals who know them best, professionals who are well-equipped to make these judgments, and we hope that gives students confidence that they are in safe hands,\u201d he said.\nGavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, said: \u201cDespite the difficult circumstances we are facing, this guidance provides assurance to students, parents and schools that grades awarded this summer will accurately reflect students\u2019 abilities and will be as valid this year as any other.\u201d",

Universities have confirmed they are making plans to start the next academic year online if social distancing continues.\nVice-chancellors are braced for potential huge losses from the lucrative international student market from September, following disruption to end-of-school learning and exams, as well as to the English-language testing required to get into a UK university.\nAnd now experts are warning that if social distancing measures stretch into the autumn, many UK-based students might also choose to defer going to university rather than start the year in their bedrooms at home.\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank says: \u201cI feel for these young people as their A-levels have been disrupted and they won\u2019t get to go to their school leavers\u2019 proms. Now they may not have their freshers\u2019 weeks either.\u201d\nHe warns that if home students don\u2019t turn up in September, institutions will face a dangerous cut in income. \u201cSome universities will start falling over. Universities will play a valuable part in pulling us out of the recession that is coming, so it is more important than ever that they survive.\u201d\nVice-chancellors are hoping to reopen campuses in time for the new academic year, but say they are working on contingency plans in case the lockdown is still in place, or they are forced to close again at short notice if the virus resurges in the winter.\nMany institutions are proposing to start first-year degrees online and move to face-to-face lectures and teaching in the second term, or as soon as campuses are able to open. But some say this is not a good option for school-leavers who haven\u2019t yet learned to study independently, and they would push the start of the year back to January.\nColin McCaig, professor of higher education policy at Sheffield Hallam University, says: \u201cI have real doubts about young people\u2019s willingness or preparedness to start an online degree this autumn.\u201d\nExisting students who are used to studying at university are more able to cope with the disruption of teaching shifting online for a term or two, he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s another thing entirely for young people who have been looking forward to starting the more usual higher education experience.\u201d\nDiana Paton, William Robertson professor of history at Edinburgh University, has been talking to her daughter about the possibility that the drama degree she plans to begin at Queen Mary University of London in September might have to start online.\n\u201cWe are advising her to wait and see. But drama is a very practical subject that involves working with other people in the same physical space. So she doesn\u2019t feel it would make sense for her to start studying her degree online, and we agree,\u201d she says.\nPaton says this would be a big disappointment for her daughter, who has already had her gap year ruined by the virus, having returned from a planned three-month trip to south-east Asia after only three weeks.\nShe thinks starting online would be challenging for students regardless of their subject. \u201cOne of the things first-year undergraduates find difficult is the transition from school to university. Part of dealing with that is getting to know their cohort, and meeting people outside of their degree.\u201d\nHillman agrees that first-year students may feel lost without a face-to-face university experience. \u201cOur research has shown that students really like lectures. That\u2019s not because they are a good way to learn, but because they are a social occasion. Online learning is a good second best, but for many it is just that \u2013 second best.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cStudents who move into a hall with 300 other people often feel lonely, so how are you going to feel if you are sitting in a bedroom at home on your own?\u201d\nHillman says many young people will not be keen to put university on hold. But, he adds, if they do, the consequences for universities, already struggling to deal with losing international students, will be grave.\nNeil Morris, professor of educational technology at the University of Leeds says, however, that good online courses are in fact \u201cvery social\u201d. \u201cThey are very much about interactive discussions and group work. But they have to be designed from the start with that in mind.\u201d\nWith online learning traditionally taking months to design, universities will be scrambling to produce something sufficiently professional and engaging in time for September.\nMorris says: \u201cI think a lot of universities should be able to do this by the autumn, given that they\u2019ve been up-scaling online provision in recent years anyway. But those that haven\u2019t already been working on this will find it much more difficult.\u201d\nDr Doug Clow, who spent 20 years at the Open University and is now advising higher education on the Coronavirus, says universities have delivered an \u201cincredible\u201d emergency response, moving all teaching online overnight with \u201cnext to no resource\u201d.\nHe is confident they will be ready to launch their degrees online in the autumn. \u201cBut the fact is that whatever universities prepare, it is still going to fall far short of what a sensible, planned start to an online programme would be.\u201d\nMike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at the University of Bath, says: \u201cStudents are accepting that the sudden switch to online teaching is all a bit belt and braces, but if we are relying on this as a means of delivery in September then it will need to look and feel much slicker.\u201d\nHe says learning technology experts and academics are working hard to find new ways to put often very complicated teaching online \u2013 but says the sector must not forget poorer students.\n\u201cThere is a big issue of whether all students have access to high-speed broadband or a quiet place in their household where they can study.\u201d\nHowever, Prof Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor of Aston University, is sceptical about pushing first years online. \u201cI\u2019ve always been reticent about online education for school leavers. It is fantastic for older learners who are juggling study alongside work and family commitments, because they tend to be very self-motivated. But it is different if you are just starting out.\u201d\nIf social distancing is still in place, Aston would look at starting first years in January. They would aim to \u201caccelerate\u201d the year, with students making up the lost time between June and August.\nChris Ince, secretary and registrar at London Metropolitan University, says his university might also postpone the start of degrees. \u201cWe might look at pushing back enrolment to October or November, depending on what is happening, and then compress the academic year by removing reading weeks and so on.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWe already have about 10% of our undergraduate intake starting in January, and they compress their course into two-and-a-half years, so we know it is achievable. But trying to do that with an entire cohort would be a big shift.\u201d",

Last month, she was forced to abandon a revival of Lucy Prebble\u2019s The Effect after the coronavirus outbreak led theatres to close. Edwards had just begun technical rehearsals when Boris Johnson warned the public not to visit theatres.\n\u201cI\u2019d said to the company we\u2019d have to close at some point,\u201d she says. \u201cI was hoping to get through the tech. So if we had to down tools, we could return and hit the ground running. I was being optimistic that we\u2019d be shut down for a couple of weeks.\u201d The Effect was due to have its first preview on 19 March but the Boulevard announced its temporary closure shortly after Johnson\u2019s 16 March briefing; the technical rehearsal was never completed. That was just over two weeks ago, \u201cbut it feels like a lifetime\u201d, says Edwards. \u201cThe longest two weeks in everyone\u2019s lives.\u201d\nThe Boulevard is part of a \u00a340m redevelopment in Walker\u2019s Court, at the end of Berwick Street market in Soho, central London. Edwards says the theatre\u2019s owner, Soho Estates, was swift to reassure everyone that no one would lose their job and they are in the process of seeing if some staff will be furloughed. The Effect was to be the third production of the Boulevard\u2019s inaugural season. As no one knows when theatres will be able to reopen, Edwards says that planning has become impossible. \u201cWe can\u2019t make any real decisions around existing projects until we know when we are allowed back in. You can only do hypothetical schedules.\u201d\nThe Effect has been postponed, as has a revival of Athol Fugard\u2019s Hello and Goodbye. The Boulevard\u2019s production of Billy Roche\u2019s The Cavalcaders, directed by Kathy Burke, is still in the schedule.\nEdwards says her team have risen to the challenges but she highlights two difficulties of facing an unprecedented crisis as a newly established company. As a small, fledgling team, \u201cyou\u2019re establishing yourselves internally. We\u2019ve been together 15 months not 15 years.\u201d There is also the theatre\u2019s relationship with its new audience to consider. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate thing, cultivating audiences from a standing start. You don\u2019t have any data, any audience at all at the start. For us, as a new venue, that\u2019s been the most depressing thing. That journey is suspended now. We\u2019ve only been open since the end of October, and there was a lot of momentum and positivity.\u201d\nThe Boulevard\u2019s first production was an intimate and rousingly atmospheric staging of a song cycle, Ghost Quartet, whose performers invited some of the audience to have a nip of whisky and even play musical instruments on stage. Many venues have been quick to release online streams of past productions as a means of maintaining profile, satisfying audience demand and in some cases appealing for donations. There is a soundtrack of Ghost Quartet, and films of that production and its successor, The Sunset Limited. Edwards is considering the logistics of releasing them.\nAlex Clifton, the artistic director of Storyhouse in Chester, which opened in 2017, tells me that his theatre has focused on sharing new original content online. More established theatres have huge archives of work they can release, he says. Instead, Storyhouse has invited actors to do twice-a-day storytelling online, at 11am and 6pm. Storyhouse\u2019s function, he says, has always included asking the most vulnerable in their community what they need. Traditionally, that has been offering a space for events. Now, without a physical space to share, they are focusing on other resources. There are creative workshops and arts-and-crafts sessions online, plus a karaoke choir. After the theatre closed, its cafe remained open on a pay-what-you-can basis. It essentially became a soup kitchen, says Clifton. \u201cThe only people out in the city, the vast majority, were homeless people. So we were giving away hot food and free drinks to up to 100 people a day.\u201d\nOn 6 March, Storyhouse announced it was postponing two home-produced shows, Brewster\u2019s Millions and Antigone, \u201cdue to economic uncertainty resulting from the coronavirus development\u201d. It was one of the first of a flood of similar announcements from UK theatres. The shows were a big investment for Storyhouse. \u201cThe season was due to cost us \u00a3190,000 of invested money, and a total of half a million,\u201d says Clifton. \u201cIt was a painful decision, but looking at the scale of the problem internationally it felt clear to us. The risk was too great.\u201d A director and designer were the only people assigned to the production; they were just about to hold the first auditions and did not want to take on actors without being able to fulfil their contracts.\nClifton says Storyhouse is now in \u201csignificant jeopardy\u201d as 83% of its income is earned income. But, as a relatively new organisation, \u201cwe have been able to create a business model that\u2019s reasonably nimble. We don\u2019t have an enormous pool of practitioners who are employed by our theatre.\u201d\nHe has established a hardship fund for freelance creatives who work with Storyhouse regularly. Despite the supporting measures announced by the government, some practitioners are \u201cfalling between the gaps\u201d, he says. The hardship fund was enabled by the furloughing of more than 80% of staff, leaving a team of 15. \u201cAs a new organisation, we haven\u2019t had time to build up the huge reserves of a bigger organisation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are exposed, but the priority has to be taking care of staff. Government support was critical.\u201d\nThree per cent of Storyhouse\u2019s income is from Arts Council England, which was quick to announce a \u00a3160m emergency response package for cultural organisations and freelancers to survive the crisis. Looking to the future, Clifton hopes ACE\u2019s support for organisations will be \u201cproportionate to the jeopardy that organisations are facing across the sector rather than proportionate to the subsidy that they receive. Three per cent of our income comes from the Arts Council, that\u2019s all, but we are a \u00a37m-turnover organisation and a relatively new one, facing significant jeopardy. This needs to be about the ability of the overall sector \u2013 making sure the smaller newer organisations, that operate on different models that aren\u2019t as reliant on the Arts Council as others, continue to strive in the future.\u201d\nMany theatres operate as charities, such as Hope Mill in Manchester, which opened in 2015 and usually receives no arts or government funding. Joseph Houston, its artistic director, says they are now in \u201ca very vulnerable position\u201d. Until the end of last year, Hope Mill had operated as a limited company, but Houston and his husband, William Whelton, with whom he co-founded the theatre, decided that becoming a charitable organisation would open up more funding possibilities. \u201cIf we had stayed as an independent limited company, I fear we\u2019d be in an even more uncertain situation,\u201d says Houston. However, certain pots of funding and grants will only be open to them once they have operated as a charity for two years.\nACE has pledged \u00a350m support for organisations not in its national portfolio, and Hope Mill will be applying for assistance. Otherwise, it is relying on donations from audience members and supporters. Like the Boulevard and Storyhouse, Hope Mill found that many customers chose to donate the cost of tickets to postponed productions. \u201cThe amazing thing has been seeing the amount of love and support for the venue.\u201d There are plans for an online fundraising concert featuring singers from past Hope Mill shows to \u201ckeep people aware that we\u2019re still here and we plan on reopening whenever we can\u201d.\nHope Mill\u2019s biggest forthcoming production is Houston\u2019s staging of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Cinderella, with choreography by Whelton. It was set to begin previews on 9 May. \u201cWe know now that we won\u2019t be opening until the end of June if not July at the earliest.\u201d\nHouston and Whelton set up Hope Mill with a \u00a310,000 loan. \u201cBack then we used to say we had nothing to lose. Now, there is so much to lose. That\u2019s the hardest thing. It keeps a roof over our heads, but we\u2019re also supporting other people\u2019s mortgages.\u201d You have to blank out the worst-case scenarios, Houston says. \u201cThe hardest thing is the unknown.\u201d\nLike Edwards and Clifton, he has found programming to be a puzzle. But he is making the most of having more time to develop ideas for Hope Mill. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the thick of it, going from production to production, you have ideas but can\u2019t really see them through. Now we\u2019re able to look at those ideas, such as supporting new writers in the north-west.\u201d\nHouston and Whelton\u2019s theatre is one of the tenants of a grade II-listed former cotton mill. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there pretty much 24/7 over the past four and a half years.\u201d Being shut out is \u201cthe strangest feeling\u201d. All artistic directors are desperate to return to their theatres. But, as Edwards says, \u201cit will be terribly moving to go back to any theatre. Now, we\u2019re crossing the road to avoid our neighbours. The idea of going back into a theatre and sitting next to someone makes me feel emotional. It\u2019s the beauty of a congregation of people watching the same thing. To be denied that is terribly hard on your soul.\u201d",

        "content": "Motor traffic and air pollution decline steeply, with walking and cycling in cities also down\nThe coronavirus outbreak has brought Britain to a near standstill, with road travel plummeting by as much as 73%, to levels not seen since 1955.\nAll forms of travel have plunged in urban areas. Walking, cycling and car and van journeys are all down by about three-quarters, while bus numbers have fallen by 60%. The number of large lorries has declined by just 40% as essential supplies continue to be transported.\nHowever, national data from Monday and Tuesday, the two most recent days available, shows a slight upward trend since the previous week, with motor traffic down only 63%, equivalent to 1962. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called the trend concerning. \u201cPlease follow medical and scientific advice to stay home and save lives,\u201d he said.\nThe empty streets have already resulted in big drops in air pollution, which is likely to reduce early deaths from lung and heart conditions. Traffic deaths and injuries are near certain to have fallen, but data is not yet available. Noise pollution, which is also known to have adverse affects on human health, is down, and the quieter streets have encouraged wildlife to venture into some towns.\nCabinet Office data shows motor traffic dropped by 73% on 29 March compared with pre-outbreak levels. Guardian analysis shows the number of road miles travelled has not been this low since 1955, when far fewer people owned cars and there were no motorways. The government data also shows rail travel down 90%, and tube and bus journeys in London down by 94% and 83% respectively.\nSome experts suggest that people who have learned how to work effectively from home may continue to do so for a day or two a week after the Covid-19 crisis is over. This could help tackle the climate emergency, because the transport sector is the biggest emitter and the only one to have increased its emissions in recent years. Others, however, say emissions could rise again if the coronavirus lockdown causes lasting financial damage to public transport services.\nDetailed data from Vivacity, a video analysis company, shows that pedestrian, bicycle and car journeys in urban areas started falling a few days after the government announced it was moving from the contain to the delay phase of its pandemic response on 12 March. Bus, van and large HGV trips started falling later, after Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown on 23 March.\nThe data shows large HGV traffic actually rose significantly in the week before the lockdown. \u201cWe interpret that as, because people were suddenly panic buying, they needed to do many more deliveries to shops across the country,\u201d Vivacity\u2019s CEO, Mark Nicholson, said.\nCyclist numbers fell more slowly than those for pedestrians, who often arrive in city centres on public transport. This may be because some people switched to cycling, either to avoid crowded buses and trains or because of sunny weather.\nNicholson said people may continue to work from home at least some of the time in future. \u201cIf that manages to decrease traffic on the roads then that would be a great outcome from an environmental perspective,\u201d he said.\nVivacity\u2019s data comes from its network of hundreds of cameras in urban areas across England, including Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Oxford, Cambridge, Peterborough, Bournemouth and on the M32. Most cameras are on busy streets, so do not monitor traffic in residential areas.\nThe company uses AI software installed in the cameras to analyse video footage of traffic, generating data that helps local authorities to plan traffic management. No images of faces are stored and numberplate data is erased every 24 hours.\nClaire Haigh, the CEO of Greener Journeys, said the big fall in revenue for public transport services might damage its viability in the longer term, with bus and coach travel already in decline before the virus struck as people shop more online.\n\u201cAny expected fall in transport emissions this year as a result of the lockdown will be short-lived if it does lasting damage to public transport systems,\u201d she said. \u201cA double-decker bus can take 75 cars off the road.\u201d The government announced \u00a3167m in new funding on Friday to support bus services over the next 12 weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital we do all we can to keep the sector running,\u201d Shapps said.\nHighways England, which operates the country\u2019s motorways and A-roads, said traffic on its network had fallen by about half since the Covid-19 crisis began. The AA, which is providing free cover to NHS workers, said recovery callouts had fallen by a third, though the number of flat batteries had risen as cars sat idle.\nData on deaths and serious injuries from road traffic incidents is only available from 2018, during which an average of 34 people died each week and 490 suffered serious injuries.\nAt 80 years old, Winston Churchill was in his final year as prime minister, and just over five million cars and vans were registered in 1955, compared with 36m in 2019. Many of the marques on the road then have since been lost, from Allard and Alvis to Riley and Singer.\nThe year was not without travel problems. A snow storm in February blocked many roads and train tracks and a long rail strike led to the declaration of a state of emergency in May.\nIn politics, Anthony Eden replaced Churchill, who retired, and the long-standing Labour leader, Clement Attlee, was replaced by Hugh Gaitskell. Evelyn Sharp became the first female permanent secretary in the civil service, but women were still barred from the House of Lords.\nChild benefit payments had been in place for 10 years, but the contraceptive pill did not become available on the NHS until 1961 and the Equal Pay Act was still 15 years away.\nGuy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby were named as Soviet spies, and Ruth Ellis became the last woman to be hanged in the UK.\nChelsea won football\u2019s First Division for the first time, and Newcastle United took the FA Cup for the sixth time, a trophy they have not won since.\nWaiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett had its English-language premiere and JRR Tolkien\u2019s final Lord of the Rings book, The Return of the King, was published.",

        "content": "Certificates to prove people are immune to Covid-19 could ease restrictions. How would such a scheme work in Britain?\nNo 10 has pointed to immunity passports as a way to end the lockdown. How would the policy work in practice?\nAn immunity passport is a certificate declaring that someone is no longer at risk of contracting coronavirus because they have already had it. It would exempt holders from restrictions on activity imposed to contain the spread of the virus.\nThe concept has been given momentum by the German public health body the Robert Koch Institute, which is organising a mass study into how many people are already immune to Covid-19. The German government has not officially commented on where it stands on immunity passports.\nGiven that the virus can be asymptomatic, a test is required to show whether coronavirus antibodies are present in the blood of the individual. A positive test would indicate that they have already had the virus and therefore would be likely to have some degree of immunity. It would also mean that they were not infectious to others.\nHealthcare workers would be able to return to work from isolation more quickly. They would also allow clinicians who have tested positive to be allocated to highest risk areas and enable personal protective equipment, which has been in short supply, to be distributed to those who need it the most.\nOther key workers, such as teachers, could also be prioritised, allowing schools to be reopened.\nThe tests, which can already be purchased on the internet, vary widely in reliability. So far, the best are 90% sensitive to Covid-19 and 90% specific. Last week, Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home-testing kits would be available within days, only for the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, to quash the idea hours later, citing concerns about accuracy.\nAnother issue is that the tests are ideally done 28 days after an infection.\nOne of the problems of combating a new virus is that there can be no certainties about how it will act. The idea of immunity passports is based on the hope that people who have recovered and test positive for coronavirus antibodies will be protected for a lengthy period of time - but, at present, it remains just a premise.\nPatients with Sars, which is also a coronavirus, did not have long-term immunity, with potentially only up to a year after the infection. In February, a Japanese tour guide tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being given the all-clear, in what was believed to be the first case of its kind.\nTo ascertain the immunity of large portions of the population, home tests would likely be necessary, but that would open up the prospect of fraud. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said if they were not limited to key workers, they could even lead to people going out to deliberately get infected so they could return to work.\nThe antibody test looks to have potential for helping clinicians get back to work and assess their risk, but only if it is sufficiently accurate. The fact that the immunity period is unknown is another problem, which together with the difficulty of testing so many people \u2013 without relying on home kits \u2013 would seem to scupper the chances of it ending the lockdown for the wider population.",

        "content": "UK local government staff working flat out on vital services like social care need coordinated support, not ministerial control\n\nNHS and care workers have gripped public attention as the country responds to the Covid-19 pandemic. But the one million people who work in local government have also been working flat-out \u2013 work that will continue well past the present crisis, that has been made much harder by 10 years of austerity, and that is not being helped by some parts of Whitehall trying to micromanage the local response.\nAs councils cope with a huge wave of demand on every front, from social care to refuse collection, they are taking daily instructions from ministers and officials across Whitehall, themselves under pressure and struggling to keep pace with directions from Downing Street.\nIronically perhaps after years of cuts, the tensions aren\u2019t about money, but about communication and coordination. There have been delays, confusion and aborted work, such as changes of policy about whether central or local government is managing the assembly and distribution of food parcels, and local preparations for additional mortuary capacity being put on hold in favour of a national response.\nWhile some difficulties are inevitable, the fundamental problem is ministers persisting in the fantasy that everything works best when it is run from the centre.\nLimited understanding about the practicalities of local delivery has affected everything from identifying which vulnerable people need help to supporting local businesses.\nIn some places food parcels have arrived stuffed with biscuits and chocolate, which then need to be supplemented with something nutritious.\nMeanwhile, public health directors are frustrated at being excluded from key communications and the development of guidance by NHS England and government departments.\nResponsibility for commissioning public health policies was moved out of central government in 2013. As former public health director Gabriel Scally  said earlier this week, public health budgets have since been systematically raided in the face of massive cuts to council funding. The heart of the local response to the virus now lies with a small number of council public health specialists \u2013 about 500 across England.\nAs the first wave of infections hit, these specialists played a crucial role in the containment phase, chasing infection contacts and coordinating the local response.\nAmong a torrent of other responsibilities, highlighted via the hashtag #adayinthelifeofadph, local public health staff are collating and analysing data, giving advice on everything from protection equipment to homelessness, managing the implementation of social distancing, supporting vulnerable people, and working with the NHS, voluntary groups and government.\nAll councils depend on these specialists to help implement the blizzard of guidance on infection control and safe working, as they work with GPs, volunteers, community groups, local businesses and government during the lockdown.\nThose who may need help are being identified from numerous sources, including responses to a government letter asking 1.5 million people judged at risk if they need help. Many people have contacted councils directly. Staff and voluntary workers \u2013 all trained in infection control \u2013 are making personal visits and keep in touch online and by phone, as well as delivering food and medicines and checking on social care and other welfare needs. Some support will come from the \u00a3500m government hardship fund.\nTwo weeks ago the NHS and the government instituted a new patient discharge regime, which amounted to an order to do whatever it takes to clear patients out of 15,000 beds. Councils are working with the NHS, care homes and voluntary groups to ensure residents being moved out of hospitals have somewhere to go and have the right support in place.\nThe government has allocated councils in England \u00a31.6bn of additional funds to cope with Covid-19 pressures, such as buying support from care providers, but the guidance did not mandate the testing of patients before discharge, leading some care homes, such as in Liverpool, to refuse to take them. Continuing difficulties in getting personal protection equipment (PPE) to care staff are also hindering discharges, and infections in care homes will put a huge additional strain on adult social care.\nSocial care staff continue to go to people\u2019s homes despite the lack of PPE. The British Association of Social Workers has warned (pdf) that staff are often seeing a dozen or more service users a day without even hand sanitiser as protection. Social workers are also scrambling to keep in touch with children who may be put at additional risk by the lockdown.\nCouncils and their contractors are trying to keep other vital services running, particularly refuse collections, knowing that any deterioration in the environment will exacerbate people\u2019s sense of fear. It\u2019s a growing problem. Some council recycling centres have closed and the volume of waste is increasing just as sickness among refuse crews increases.\nHuge efforts have been made to get rough sleepers off the streets, including working with volunteers and businesses to get people into hotels and revamp empty properties. And councils are gearing up to help an expected surge in domestic abuse victims.\nLocal authorities also have to handle the emotionally-charged practicalities around funerals. Guidance from Public Health England now says only immediate family are allowed to attend and social distancing rules must be maintained.\nSome families are waiting to remove bodies from hospital mortuaries in the hope that the rules might be relaxed in a few weeks, while many undertakers are not working as normal. As a result, mortuary capacity is rapidly running out, and emergency facilities are being built.\nUnder intense pressure, local government\u2019s role has been a mix of community leadership, implementing national plans in ways that are sensitive to local needs, and providing support for everyone from rough sleepers to businesses.\nWhen the immediate crisis is over, councils need to ram home the message that while national guidance has often been essential in fighting Covid-19, local government is at its best when it has maximum freedom to meet local needs. When the plaudits are being handed out, councils will deserve huge credit for the energy and innovation they have brought to leading their communities.\n Richard Vize is a public policy commentator and analyst",

        "content": "Bar exams have been delayed until August, but trainees have called on regulators to move their assessments online\nLaw graduates training to become barristers have called on regulators to cancel face-to-face exams, which have been delayed until August, and to swiftly move assessments online instead.\nThe Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) is one of the last remaining courses where students must still sit exams in person, as regulators insist they are needed to uphold the \u201chigh standards and integrity\u201d of the degree.\nBut students say that the Bar Standards Board (BSB), which regulates the exams, must prioritise student wellbeing during the unprecedented global pandemic.\nIn an open letter, signed by 200 BPTC trainees, they urge the BSB to rethink its stance. \u201cIn an extraordinary time of a global pandemic [...] It is essential that the BSB considers [the] human impact, and [...] make adjustments to the format of the exams,\u201d they said.\nUniversities across the country, including Oxford and Cambridge, have already said they will replace traditional undergraduate exams with online assessments. At Imperial College London medical students have also taken unsupervised exams at home for the first time.\nIf the pandemic has not eased by August, sitting exams in person could put students \u2013 particularly those with underlying health conditions \u2013 at risk. International students who have left the UK may also be unable to sit exams in August, students say, and it could make it difficult for others to begin their pupillage and effectively start their careers.\nAlex Mullen, a law student at BPP University Law School, says it would be a financial struggle for him to sit face-to-face exams in August. \u201cI have a scholarship designed to pay for my course and the costs of living until the end of the course, which is now longer than when they thought it would be. My tenancy also ends in August, so I could have to find somewhere to live for two weeks in the middle of what is going to be a really stressful exam season,\u201d he says.\nRobert Harris, a student at City Law school, says the situation is tense. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overplay our concerns and we recognise this is a difficult time for everyone and others have it worse, but still these are real concerns. For me, the key impact is on when I\u2019ll be able to start my pupillage. It seems strange that the Bar course is the only one to say [moving assessments online is] not possible.\u201d\nThe BSB says it is exploring a range of contingency plans if restrictions remain in place in August. \u201cWe are very conscious that this is a difficult and uncertain time for students,\u201d it said in a comment. \u201cHowever, there is no secure solution that could be put in place by April to enable us to deliver these exams as normal. The next scheduled opportunity is August and that is what we are working toward.\u201d\nHowever, the Bar Council says it sees \u201cno reason\u201d why exams must be face-to-face in August and that it is \u201cconcerned\u201d that this is \u201cnot the best solution\u201d. \u201cIt creates delay and uncertainty for students. It means students will be sitting exams long after their teaching has finished, and very close to the time when their pupillages would start. And it is unclear how resits can be accommodated,\u201d Nicholas Vineall QC, Chair of the Bar Council\u2019s education and training committee, says. \u201cIt ought to be possible to arrange for these exams to be taken online.\u201d\nElsewhere in the legal profession, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) rowed back on plans to delay exams until the Autumn, after students urged the regulator to rethink. They have since asked universities to send proposals on how they would like to do exams instead. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said what online things must be used, they\u2019re just saying \u2018tell us what you want to do and we\u2019ll consider it\u2019,\u201d Charlotte Parkinson, Chair of the Junior Lawyers Division of the Law Society, says.\nLegal education is often traditional and slow to adopt online practices. However, individual lecturers are working hard to set up online learning and assessments, similarly to academics teaching other subjects.\nAlan East, an assistant professor at Coventry Law School, says the pandemic has meant exams have gone online at Coventry. He has also connected with students over Zoom and Microsoft Teams. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to push this over the past couple of years and it has been quite slow but I think this period of being confined to our houses and having to do things online will move things along a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cLaw has begun to modernise.\u201d\nStudents say regulators must be creative and find modern solutions, too.",

Smaller enterprises have been offered business interruption loans but it emerged that banks arranging the state-backed borrowing had been seeking personal guarantees, which mean borrowers often have to put their homes on the line.\nDespite the revisions to the aid programme, some small business owners still feel that it may not be enough.\nKim Langley, 30, who runs a cleaning business in Leicestershire is not sure the changes are of much help to her. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a loan and I feel if I applied for one I might struggle to make any profit because I\u2019ll be paying it back,\u201d she said. \u201cI tend to keep prices low for our loyal customers so I think it would be difficult.\u201d\nLangley started the business three years ago and employed four people but now, because of the coronavirus, she has had to let them all go. \u201cI lost 14 customers and so had to cut their hours,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I only have one job left \u2013 cleaning the office of a company that recovers emergency services vehicles.\n\u201cThe girls asked me about sick pay but I simply couldn\u2019t afford to pay \u00a395 a week with nothing coming in. I spoke to them and said they either finish now and claim what they can from the government, or they can stay on but there may not be a business to come back to. In the end I let them all go.\n\u201cI\u2019ve paid off all my suppliers and insurance and I\u2019ll pay myself at the end of next month but then that\u2019s it. If it all goes wrong I\u2019ll have to dissolve the company. If I come out the other end I\u2019ll be surprised.\u201d\nBrian Wright, who has been running his joinery business in Chatham, Kent, for 20 years, said the lockdown has been a nightmare so far. \u201cAll of our suppliers gradually ground to a halt after the lockdown was announced,\u201d said the 53-year-old.\nWright doesn\u2019t believe the latest measures would make a great deal of difference: \u201cThe removal of personal guarantees would help but I\u2019d need to look into the small print. When you\u2019re trading hand to mouth, taking on extra debt is not ideal.\u201d\nTotally Bespoke Joinery in Chatham specialises in making timber staircases and fitted furniture. It employs four people, specialising in timber staircases and fitted furniture, and Wright has used the government\u2019s furlough scheme, in which employees are temporarily laid off and 80% of their pay is covered by the state. \u201cI\u2019ve furloughed them but can\u2019t top up the extra 20%. I\u2019m just working with the cash I\u2019ve got at hand,\u201d said Wright. \u201cThe difficult thing is that I don\u2019t get any help as company director, even though my salary is comparable to what my guys get.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle. I\u2019ve got about \u00a368,000 worth of work sitting on the shop floor because I can\u2019t install them. I\u2019ve deferred all payments for about three months which will just about keep us alive for the same amount of time. I won\u2019t be able to pay my supplier invoices from March so I hope they will be lenient. I\u2019m just trying to make ends meet and this has thrown a spanner in the works \u2013 a big one.\u201d\nIn Newcastle, hair salon owner Maddi Cook thinks the removal of personal guarantees on emergency loans is good but there\u2019s still more to be done. \u201cI know they\u2019re trying to turn noes into yesses but people will still be left out,\u201d said the 31-year-old. \u201cThe people who are really going to suffer are those who are not hugely wealthy. It feels like the same thing is happening again.\n\u201cI\u2019m not keen on taking out a loan. The big banks will only lend a minimum of \u00a325,000 and that\u2019s too much. I also don\u2019t want to be in debt as we\u2019re not sure what will happen after all of this.\u201d\nCook has been running Ritual Salon for five years, which includes leasing out her facilities to hair dressers. \u201cI have two chair renters who pay me a fixed weekly rent,\u201d she said. \u201cMy salon is on a large premises owned by my landlady. She is able to get a \u00a310,000 grant and has said we don\u2019t need to pay rent which is helpful. Since the lockdown I\u2019ve lost my main income. I make a bit of money from my coaching business but that is only a couple of hundred pounds a month. It\u2019s the people like my renters who I worry about \u2013 their income is down by 40% now.\u201d\nSajjad Rahman, 38, has been running Taste of India on the Isle of Sheppey which has been in the family for 29 years and can obtain a \u00a310,000 business rates relief grant unveiled in last month\u2019s budget for firms hit by the Coronavirus-related slowdown. \u201cWe\u2019re eligible for the government grant which is helpful,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that we\u2019re a takeaway only business. Most restaurants are 60% sit in and 40% takeaway, but they\u2019ll be lucky if they make another 20% on top of their takeaway services in this climate.\n\u201cI think removing the personal guarantee is a good move by the government. It shows they\u2019ve realised it wasn\u2019t working. We don\u2019t need a loan at the moment but I think it would help a lot of people in my position move forward if they need to.\u201d\nRahman\u2019s takeaway business employs five people and they\u2019ve been just as busy since the lockdown: \u201cNothing has changed much as people have carried on eating. Safety is a big priority when we go out to deliver food \u2013 I\u2019ve invested in medical grade alcohol gel in the shop and kitchen, and everyone wears gloves and masks. I worry though about the restaurant industry as a whole. If the shutdown is longer than three months it would be catastrophic. I don\u2019t know how people will be able to survive.\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous but we\u2019ll just ride it out all together. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I wanted to give back to the NHS and have been giving away free meals to all staff. So far we\u2019ve given away more than 80. I regard them as superheroes, putting themselves on the frontline. I think we should respect them as we do soldiers dodging bullets on the front line.\u201d\nStuart Baker, 31, and Simon Petty, 30, operate a creative consultancy and design studio in London and feel the chancellor\u2019s proposals would make things easier for them. \u201cI don\u2019t own any assets but Simon does,\u201d said Baker. \u201cSo not having to put his house up as collateral is a big plus.\u201d\nOut of Order Design was founded two years ago and Baker and Petty work with four to five freelancers depending on the project. \u201cIt seems quite daunting to apply for a loan, not to mention time-consuming and stressful,\u201d said Baker. \u201cBut if some barriers will be removed then that would help. Our monthly salaries are \u00a31,750 so well below the \u00a32,500 threshold for the grant on the self-employed income support scheme.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any jobs cancelled, just postponed. One is \u00a315,000 for an installation which has been pushed till the end of summer, and another is \u00a35,000. We haven\u2019t paid our rent which was due on Wednesday and we\u2019ve delayed our corporation tax which is \u00a311,000. We\u2019ll be fine for the next few weeks. We\u2019re just working from home as best we can on projects that can come to light after all this.\u201d",

It will definitely impact the model of carbon flows,\u201d said Oregon State University microbiologist Steve Giovannoni. \u201cIt will require more than just a small tweak.\u201d\nResearchers say the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic is probably the largest annual biological carbon sequestration mechanism on the planet. Like a vast forest of tiny plants in the sunlight upper part of the ocean, they draw down carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The bigger the plankton, the higher the chance they will sink into the deep mesopelagic zone of the ocean, where carbon can be trapped for more than 1,000 years.\nUntil now, climate models have assumed that diatoms \u2013 one of the biggest types of plankton \u2013 were dominant. But the study, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology Journal, reveals they are a very minor share of biomass when compared with much smaller cyanobacteria, picophytoeukaryotes and nanophytoeukaryotes.\nThis was expected in winter, but the research team found that even in spring \u2013 shortly before the annual bloom \u2013 there were far fewer diatoms in the western North Atlantic than assumed\n\u201cWe asked, how could our impressions of this ocean region be so far off?\u201d Giovannoni said. \u201cThere are three possibilities: new equipment that allows us to see smaller plankton more clearly, the fact that previous studies had focussed on more eastern regions, and climate change altering the biology of the ocean.\u201d\nAlthough the findings of this study of one part of the North Atlantic \u2013 much of it carried out in fierce gales \u2013 do not necessarily apply to all oceans, Giovannoni said they highlight how little is understood of marine biology, as well as the need for close-up study.\nNasa and other satellite monitoring agencies have previously used images from space to assess the carbon draw-down capacity of algae blooms, but they will need to revise the assumptions on which their calculations are based.\n The headline on this article was amended on 4 April 2020 to make clear that the story is about the North Atlantic, not all oceans as suggested in an earlier version.",

Ward, 72, was jailed in December 2011 for indecent exposure and weapons offences after police found a huge haul of weapons including a loaded Luger pistol under his pillow and the cockpit of a second world war fighter plane with working machine guns at his remote cottage.\nOn Tuesday up to six officers began digging up a plot at Appletree Cottage in Chop Gate on the edge of the North York Moors national park. Police said they were working with a forensic archaeologist, after the discovery of suspected human bones. It is understood the cottage is now in the hands of new owners, but was previously owned by Ward\u2019s family for more than 300 years.\nA spokesman for North Yorkshire police said: \u201cAlthough it is too early to say precisely how old these bones are, current forensic investigations suggest they are not recent and are likely to be several decades old. Specialists are being used to recover and examine them.\n\u201cWe\u2019d ask people not to speculate online about the nature of the bones while this process is under way.\u201d\nWard\u2019s neighbour Mandy Dunford said police arrived three days ago and there had been a lot of activity ever since. \u201cThey are searching the property and people in the Dale have been told that human remains have been found,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning.\u201d\nDunford, 59, suffered a nine-year campaign of intimidation from Ward, who would creep around her property naked, sometimes dressed only in military boots, shouldering a rifle.\nShe revealed her ordeal in 2015 after Ward was released from prison and tried to move back to his home \u2013 but was prevented from doing so after intervention from the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, Dunford\u2019s MP.\nDunford said of Ward: \u201cThat man put me through hell, and even though he was prevented from coming back here I can\u2019t seem to shake off his memory.\u201d\nWard, an eccentric military expert, was arrested after police discovered a huge cache of bombs and live weaponry at his cottage. RAF bomb squad officers were brought in to carry out controlled explosions on the moorland above his isolated home.\nWard was subsequently jailed at Teesside crown court after admitting 11 counts of exposure, three charges of possessing a prohibited firearm and seven other firearms offences.\nAt the time Dunford, a retired police officer, said Ward\u2019s behaviour became increasingly erratic after the death of his brother, Brian, in 2002.\nShe said: \u201cHe first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. He would run around the house at night, shouting and tapping on the windows. When I was working during the day he would come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks.\n\u201cSometimes he would climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage, and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off behind me, I was terrified.\n\u201cHe had a favourite stone on the lane next to my house where he used to stand to watch me with his pants down and shirt pulled up. He would stand there for hours and hours every day. Terrorising me became the only focus of his life. I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.\u201d\nFive North Yorkshire police officers were subsequently reprimanded after an internal disciplinary inquiry concluded they failed to meet \u201cappropriate investigatory standards\u201d.",

Unfortunately, my wish was not granted and I will forever think of that lost moment when we were so close to winning for the people of the United Kingdom.\u201d\nCorbyn is due to step down after five years as Labour leader on Saturday. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is widely expected to win the race to replace him, which started \u2013 unofficially \u2013 after December\u2019s general election, in which the party won its lowest number of seats since 1935.\nVoting opened in the competition on 24 February and closed on Thursday. The three candidates \u2013 Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy \u2013 have been asked to pre-record victory speeches to be issued as soon as the result is announced.\nAlvarez said: \u201cIt has been incredibly hard for me to watch my husband vilified and to hear his words twisted by his political opponents and some in the media. It has been even harder to watch him be attacked by his own party.\u201d\nThe human rights lawyer said Corbyn had told her the first thing he would do if he became prime minister after the 2019 election was to spend more money on the NHS.\n\u201cI read about the work that our amazing heroes in the NHS are doing during the coronavirus outbreak and only wish that the investment our health service needs had been offered long before now,\u201d she said.\nAlvarez said it had been the privilege of her life to meet people across the country as part of Corbyn\u2019s work as Labour leader. \u201cWe are all part of the cosmos and we all have a part to play in rebuilding our movement.\u201d\nShe thanked people who voted for Labour and supported her husband, and urged the party not to lose sight of its \u201ccommitment to socialism and the policies of the manifesto\u201d.\n\u201cWe know you shared our values.

The content, produced in association with the likes of the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Premier League and Puffin Books, will be tailored for the syllabuses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThere will also be daily educational podcasts aimed at both primary and secondary school children, while content for older children will be provided through live online Q&As with teachers.\nChildren who should be studying for GCSEs and A-levels will also be directed to BBC Four, which will show a block of programming between 7pm and 9pm on weekday evenings linked to their syllabus \u2013 such as classic Shakespeare performances or relevant documentaries.\n\u201cOur commitment is to be there for as long as schools are closed,\u201d said the BBC\u2019s children\u2019s director, Alice Webb, adding that millions of British children were already turning to the Bitesize education service. \u201cWe are creating 150 new lessons a week.\u201d\nShe said that while many schools were sending worksheets to parents, the BBC material was designed to help teach new concepts and ensure ongoing learning. The output has been developed with the Department for Education, which will ensure schools are aware of what is coming up so they can support pupils working remotely.\nHowever, the public broadcaster may find that some homeschooling habits have already set in by the time the programmes launch, a month into the lockdown. Many parents have turned to existing online learning resources, while some schools are still providing material to pupils, and there has been a boom in educational material on YouTube. Wealthier parents are also increasingly turning to private tuition.\nIn a sign of the government\u2019s fast-changing attitudes towards the BBC since the start of the coronavirus crisis \u2013 when ministers were still boycotting Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u2013 the announcement was accompanied by approving quotes from multiple cabinet ministers.\nGovernment sources said the relationship between the government and the national broadcaster was now much improved thanksto its work during the pandemic. \u201cThe BBC were amongst the first to roll up their sleeves on coronavirus and it\u2019s been good to see,\u201d said one.\nThe culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, who will have responsibility for overseeing the recently closed consultation on decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee, said: \u201cThis is public service broadcasting at its best and will make a big difference to millions of children across the UK while schools are closed. I\u2019m delighted the BBC is working closely with the government to help make sure our children are educated, informed and entertained during these challenging times.\u201d",

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that public borrowing could balloon to more than \u00a3200bn, outstripping in cash terms the budget deficit Britain was left with after the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe government has promised to pay 80% of the wages of workers and most of the self-employed, as well as offering billions of pounds of support to British companies, despite intense criticism that serious gaps remain in its plan.\nWarning against the use of austerity to balance the books once the dust settles on the Covid-19 outbreak, McDonnell said Britain needed to embark on a decade-long programme of intensive government investment to stage a fightback from the current crisis.\nFaced with the challenges of global heating and entrenched inequalities in Britain leading up to the pandemic, he said investment in infrastructure to end the country\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels and greater steps to share wealth would be urgently needed.\n\u201cIf we are to build the resilience needed to cope with any further waves of this virus, or other future unknown threats, our new society needs to be built on fully funded, publicly owned and democratically controlled public services,\u201d he said.\nThe shadow chancellor said the crisis had highlighted the vital importance of the public sector and the need for a stronger safety net to safeguard people\u2019s lives and livelihoods \u2013 shown by the way the political dogma of the Conservatives had been ditched as the crisis intensified.\n\u201cAs we enter possibly a longer and more distressing period of this pandemic, we must give people hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that together we can make it a bright one. We will never let our eyes become accustomed to the dark,\u201d he added.",

But JD Wetherspoon, the pubs chain, was among the biggest losers in the UK.\nRevolut\u2019s customers are likely to be younger and slightly more urban than account holders at the traditional big banks. But the data \u2013 taken from spending by the digital lender\u2019s 3 million customers from 1-31 March \u2013 gives a strong indication of the consumption patterns that have emerged since the pandemic gripped Britain.\nThe surprise winner was Moonpig. Revolut said transactions at the online personalised cards company soared by 156% during the month. The retailer said it had been so busy since the virus struck that its orders were taking a week longer to deliver than normal.\nGames companies also had a big increase as people stayed at home. Transactions at the online firm Steam Games rose 116% in March, while PlayStation was up 105%. Britons were also watching more television (Netflix transactions were up 4%) and streaming more music (Spotify gained 9%).\nJD Wetherspoon, which had pledged to keep its 867 pubs open as long as possible, until they were shut by government measures, recorded the sharpest drop in transactions among Revolut\u2019s customers. They declined by 86% during the month.\nAt Pret a Manger, transactions were down 82%; at Nando\u2019s they fell 78%. All the big high street store chains experienced a 70-80% decline.\nWhile media attention has focused on panic buying in supermarkets, the biggest percentage increase in sales during March was at local convenience stores. Revolut said Nisa, McColls and Costcutter \u201ceach saw an increase in the number of transactions larger than any of the UK\u2019s major supermarkets\u201d.\nAt Nisa, sales values were up 52%, as people bought more locally, although the number of transactions were up only 15%, indicating that on each trip Revolut\u2019s consumers purchased more than usual.\nTransaction volumes at Argos and Amazon rose by 20% in March among Revolut\u2019s customers. But overall, total UK online spending was down 12% on the month, the lender said.\n\u201cWhile this isn\u2019t as drastic as the drop in physical transactions, it indicates that in general people are spending less online, perhaps due to an increase in delivery times for non-essential goods,\u201d Revolut said. \u201cConsumers may also be limiting their spending due to fear of furlough, redundancy or salary reductions.\u201d\nThe figures also show a sharp decline in cash payments. Revolut said ATM withdrawals by its customers plunged by 83% last month.",

Since then, the UK government has been accused of issuing mixed messages, of over-promising and under-delivering \u2013 the UK\u2019s daily testing rate has only just passed 10,000.\n11 March: Tests to be expanded\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is \u201crolling out a big expansion of testing\u201d but declines to give a specific timetable. NHS England says there are plans to increase coronavirus testing to 10,000. The UK-wide death toll stands at eight \u2013 1,215 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK.\n12 March: Tests to be restricted\nThe UK moves from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of its plan to tackle coronavirus. Boris Johnson announces that health workers will no longer test people for the virus in their homes, but will continue to test people already in hospitals.\n16 March: WHO says \u2018test, test, test\u2019\nThe WHO urges countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. 3,826 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK.\n18 March: \u2018Test 25,000 a day\u2019 \u2013 but no timetable\nBoris Johnson announces the ambition of carrying out 25,000 tests a day, but provides no detail. 5,779 tests are carried out that day.\n19 March: \u2018Antibody tests coming soon\u2019 \u2013 but no timetable\nThe prime minister says mass testing to see if people have already contracted the virus, and are probably therefore immune, will take place relatively soon, which he says would be a game-changer. The UK death toll from coronavirus stands at 144.\n24 March: \u2018UK has 3.5m antibody tests\u2019 \u2013 but no timetable\nMatt Hancock announces the government has bought 3.5m antibody tests, which can determine if someone has had coronavirus. He repeats that general testing will be ramped up, but with no timeframe for deployment. 6,491 tests are performed.\n25 March: \u2018UK aiming for 250,000 tests a day\u2019 \u2013 but no timetable\nJohnson tells the daily Downing Street press conference: \u201cWe are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day.\u201d 6,583 tests are carried out.\n25 March: \u2018Antibody tests within days\u2019 \u2013 then denied\nEarlier that day, Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at PHE, says mass antibody testing in the UK will be possible within days. The government later takes a more cautious line, saying the tests will not be available so quickly.\n27 March: \u2018Dramatic increase planned\u2019 \u2013 but no timetable\nMichael Gove announces that a \u201cnew alliance\u201d of businesses, research institutes and universities will boost antigen testing capacity (which checks if someone has the virus) for frontline workers. He says hundreds of people will receive the tests over the weekend and that there will be a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase in testing the following week.\n31 March: \u2018Testing hampered by chemical shortage\u2019\nOnly 8,240 people are tested on this day. Gove says the availability of certain chemicals is limiting the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity.\n1 April \u2013 Ministers admit only 0.4% of NHS staff have  been tested\nDespite its 27 March announcement, Downing Street confirms that only 2,000 people out of 500,000 frontline NHS England workers had been tested for coronavirus so far. Public Health England\u2019s Prof Yvonne Doyle appears to confirm that the UK\u2019s strategy is now to increase testing for the virus in the general population. A total of 9,793 tests are carried out.\n2 April: Government sets new target \u2013 and admits 3.5m antibody tests don\u2019t work\nTesting passes 10,000 a day for the first time since the start of the crisis, with 10,215 carried out. Hancock sets a new government target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April \u2013 including both antibody and antigen tests. He says the UK wants to buy 17.5m antibody tests, \u201csubject to them working\u201d, and that early tests had been \u201cpoor\u201d. None of the 3.5m tests bought by the government \u2013 and announced on 24 March \u2013 have been found to work so far.\n3 April: 100,000 target clarified\nHancock tells broadcasters that the prime minister\u2019s 25 March commitment to get to 250,000 tests a day \u201cstill stands\u201d, but that he wanted to \u201cput a very clear timeline\u201d on the goal to get to 100,000 by the end of the month. He says it is \u201cfrustrating\u201d that the first antibody tests have not worked. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is forced to clarify that the 100,000 target is for England only.",

        "content": "As the pandemic gets worse, delivery workers will get sick \u2013 and very likely some of us will die. At what point does it become too much?\nThings were looking up for Blake Volkan. The 33-year-old Turkish Russian immigrant had been delivering food on a bicycle in New York for five years, earning as little as $3.90 a trip on platforms like Caviar and Grubhub. Last year, he got married, quit delivery, and earned a handyman\u2019s certification before landing a subcontracting job doing repairs for a hotel. The pay was much better, and he noticed the difference in how people would treat him. \u201cDoing delivery, people treat me like a dog. But as a handyman? \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 smiling, \u2018How are you,\u2019 and everything.\u201d\nThen the coronavirus hit, and the hotel told Volkan not to come in any more. His wife was furloughed from her job. Volkan realized he needed to get back on the bike and fire up the old apps. \u201cI like my job, but at the moment I have to survive,\u201d he told me.\nLike Volkan, I am among tens of thousands of couriers in New York City, suddenly thrust to the frontlines of a deadly global pandemic. It was already a dangerous job \u2013 our injury rates run up to 44 times those of the average American job; seven of us were killed in New York in 2019 alone \u2013 and it has become far more dangerous now. We are called \u201cheroes\u201d and finally being acknowledged as \u201cessential\u201d, but the truth is this job was never the first choice for many of us.\nFor me, this job is a supplement to freelance writing; I decided to stop doing deliveries when the first few coronavirus cases were confirmed in New York. But others don\u2019t have that option. While writing this piece I spoke to workers aged 18 to 58, many of whom are pressing on in spite of unsafe conditions. There are many first-time delivery workers, laid off from other jobs, learning how to use the apps. No one is making a ton of money, and everyone is nervous.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve been doing this work for a day or a half decade: platforms like Grubhub, Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash (which recently purchased Caviar from Square) consider us \u201cindependent contractors\u201d and we are therefore not entitled to health insurance, worker\u2019s compensation, much less basic support from a human being. When the outbreak began, the apps simply sent out emails that sounded copy-and-pasted from the CDC (\u201cStay home and wash your hands!\u201d).\nNow, apparently worried about losing market share, the apps have temporarily waived commission fees for restaurants and cut customers\u2019 delivery fees to zero. Yet they have offered no bonuses or hazard pay for workers \u2013 the assumption is that we are disposable. The farthest they have gone is to promise up to two weeks\u2019 pay if a worker presents proof of a Covid-19 diagnosis, something that is difficult to obtain even with obvious symptoms. Workers who have tried requesting payments say the process is a nightmare.\nIn practice, our best hope is to be careful and pray. Volkan considers himself well prepared, thanks to an ample supply of face masks and gloves from his handyman work. But he is getting scared as he notices more and more couriers coughing and looking sick. Many don\u2019t have masks.\nEven with protective gear, delivering food to a locked-down city has become total chaos. Demand is surging from the millions of New Yorkers suddenly forced to stay home, yet restaurants are severely short-staffed. Recently, Volkan was assigned to pick up food from a trendy West Village eatery that had begun offering delivery during the lockdown. Upon arrival he saw dozens of couriers crowded together on the sidewalk, and inside, what appeared to be a single cook, struggling to handle hundreds of orders. Volkan waited an hour for the order before police came and ordered everyone to disperse. The restaurant canceled all the orders and Volkan was not paid. He just moved on.\nThe apps have hyped up a new \u201cno-contact\u201d delivery option, which allows couriers to leave food in a building\u2019s lobby to encourage physical distancing. But not all customers abide by it, or appreciate it. After completing one no-contact delivery recently, Volkan said he received a call from the customer, cursing at him. \u201cHe screamed, \u2018You son of a bitch, do your job properly!\u2019 It was my first time getting that in five years.\u201d\nUsually, high demand means more orders, which for couriers means more earnings. But since the outbreak, Volkan has accepted multiple orders only to discover upon arriving that the requested restaurant was shuttered. With no way to cancel in-progress deliveries using his Caviar app, he has had to message a support agent to request the cancellation \u2013 a process which usually takes minutes, but during the pandemic has taken as long as four hours, preventing new orders from being sent in the meantime. Once, out of desperation, he rode his bike empty-handed to the customer\u2019s address and marked the order \u201cdelivered\u201d just so he could continue working. \u201cI called the customer; I\u2019m like, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re not going to get your order. Please contact Caviar.\u201d\nMost worryingly, hygiene has proven surprisingly difficult. Despite the pandemic, restaurants have been refusing to allow couriers to wash their hands in the sink. To make do, Volkan traded some of his face masks with another delivery worker for some hand sanitizer the other worker had ordered through DoorDash. DoorDash charged the worker $5 for shipping (other workers have been charged $10-$40). \u201cThe bottles were so small,\u201d Volkan said. \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap\u2026 but they want the five dollars. They got to make a profit off of everyone.\u201d I contacted Grubhub, Postmates, Square, and Doordash for comment but did not receive a response before publication. A spokesperson for Uber Eats acknowledged the virus was \u201cespecially concerning for people who drive and deliver with Uber. In these difficult times, their well-being is at the top of our minds, and we have a dedicated team working around the clock to support them the very best we can.\u201d\nAccording to some estimates, on-demand food is set to be a $385bn industry by the end of this decade. Grubhub\u2019s stock has jumped nearly 33% since the announcement of New York City\u2019s lockdown; DoorDash has recently filed for an IPO, with a pre-pandemic valuation of $13bn. In a call with shareholders on 19 March \u2013 when two hundred people in the United States had died from the virus \u2013 Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dana Khosrowshahi, said the company\u2019s Eats business was growing and revealed Uber had a $10bn pile of unrestricted cash. \u201cIn any crisis, liquidity is key,\u201d he said. The day after the call, Uber\u2019s stock jumped 40%.\nThat financial firepower has not been deployed for us. Instead, we are fed hazy rhetoric. According to Doordash, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together\u201d (until you want benefits; then you\u2019re an independent contractor). In a self-congratulatory blogpost last week, Uber announced \u201cincreasing earning opportunities for Uber Eats\u201d \u2013 rather than a pay increase, this turned out to simply be a new feature allowing Uber rideshare drivers to also deliver food. This isn\u2019t helpful. As the pandemic continues to worsen, it is a matter of certainty that delivery workers will get sick \u2013 and it\u2019s more than likely that some of us will die. At what point does it become too much?\nThe companies bet that our individual precarity will motivate us to keep delivering until we land in the hospital; that we are not organized enough to stand up to them. But in the last week, gig workers for the grocery delivery service Instacart, as well as workers for Amazon and Whole Foods, have gone on strike to protest unacceptable working conditions. I am waiting for takeout couriers to do the same.\nLaws are coming around to our side: recently the New York court of appeals ruled Postmates workers should be considered employees for the purposes of unemployment benefits; a law in California signed last year, Assembly Bill 5, reclassifies gig workers as employees more generally, though it has not yet been implemented. The apps are fighting these efforts tooth-and-nail to protect their outsized profits. They should think about protecting their workers for a change.\nUntil then, we\u2019ll have to make it on our own. Recently, to try and pad his income, Volkan told me he had started buying a few shares of gig-work companies\u2019 stocks. After all, this could be the closest he\u2019ll ever get to owning part of the industry he\u2019s given years of labor to.\nBut would he buy Square or DoorDash? \u201cHell no,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cWhy? Because they don\u2019t care about us, that\u2019s why.\u201d",

        "content": "Look past its florid quest story \u2013 this fairytale is an outlier in a 1980s fantasy film canon that can still make me teary\nI became obsessed with the 1984 film The NeverEnding Story through the power of scrapbooking. Despite missing this meta-textual fairytale when it was released, someone in my family home had clipped out the black-and-white production stills presumably intended to jazz up the entertainment listings of our local paper. I then Pritt Sticked these contextless images into my jumbo movie scrapbook, which ended up being a NeverEnding Story fanzine because I never added anything else to it.\nI revered that tatty book. As the 1980s crawled onward in the sedate and rather culturally remote Scottish Borders where I grew up, I would periodically pore over these snapshots from an unknown fantasy world. They depicted a rock monster with a jutting Desperate Dan chin, a dapper adventurer in a top hat petting a giant snail and a wizened man with elven ears. This was the height of Dungeons & Dragons mania, so it seemed reasonable to assume that this mismatched band would embark on a quest to retrieve the magical cauldron or whatever.\nDoes this not ring any bells? Perhaps the overworked journalist who assembled those listings back in the day hadn\u2019t seen The NeverEnding Story, either. Certainly none of the images featured Bastian or Atreyo, the boyish heroes of the piece, nor Falkor, the giant dog-faced draught excluder who swoops in to save them at vital moments. When I finally saw the film a few years later, it was a discombobulating experience. The plot, where the modern-day Bastian discovers his destiny is entwined with the fantasy book he is reading, was far removed from the story I had imagined.\nThe NeverEnding Story has remained a personally memorable outlier in a crammed 1980s fantasy film canon that includes Labyrinth, Willow and the heroically naff Krull. Viewed from 2020, that magnificent cluster looks like the last starburst of pre-CGI practical magic, where allegorical realms were ingeniously magicked up from matte paintings, physical puppetry and the judicious deployment of dry ice. The NeverEnding Story even boasted a title track synth-pop banger co-written by Giorgio Moroder, a tinkly but potent earworm with a M\u00f6bius strip chorus that still feels as if it could loop back on itself for ever.\nSo it felt a little weird to cue up the film on Netflix and revisit this dusty wing of my mind palace, albeit with a deeper appreciation of Moroder and armed with the knowledge that director Wolfgang Petersen was coming to this family-friendly project fresh off Das Boot. Turns out, The NeverEnding Story is still a florid but uneven quest, dense with lore about the world of Fantasia harvested from the source material \u2013 a bestselling children\u2019s book by the German author Michael Ende \u2013 but confusingly framed by modern-day scenes of the bullied Bastian, who spends most of the time hiding out in his school\u2019s dusty attic hunched over his precious book.\nNow, as then, I wish I had that actual tome: it looks like the sort of fantasy doorstop that would have a detailed map of the lands of Fantasia in its endpapers, so it would be easier to figure out how the royal Ivory Tower geographically relates to the Desert of Shattered Hopes and the Swamps of Sadness. The fantastical characters I had fixated on all those years ago are still merely bit players: emissaries from the various compass points of Fantasia, comparable to the motley background patrons of the Mos Eisley cantina in Star Wars. (Although this time round it clicked that the dapper dude dressed like Willy Wonka is played by Deep Roy, who would go on to appear as multiple munchkins in Tim Burton films.)\nThe intervening years have not been kind to The NeverEnding Story. It feels like a grab-bag of well-worn ideas and obstacles as Atreyo tackles a fantasy-trope assault course in search of the higher learning that will defeat amorphous baddie the Nothing, a broiling black cloud apparently fuelled by apathy in the real world. Spoiler: in the end, Atreyo needs the fourth-wall-breaking help of Bastian himself.\nIf it catches you in the right frame of mind, it might resonate as a metaphor about the hallowed power of stories. Watch it in snark mode and it feels like an overstretched Crystal Maze episode. Yet for all the dubbed dialogue, variable acting and wonky effects, it still contains one genuinely shattering sequence. The plucky warrior-teen Atreyo is leading his magnificent white stallion Artax through the Swamps of Sadness in search of an oracle. Under Fantasia\u2019s fairytale rules, this fetid slurry can claim any traveller who surrenders to its miasma of depression.\nFor whatever reason, Artax gives up and begins to slowly sink into the peaty murk while an increasingly frantic Atreyo looks on. In an otherwise goofy fable, it is an emotionally scourging scene that seems to take forever. The previously dauntless Atreyo is inconsolable; his huddled reader-companion Bastian is in bits. And if the viewer isn\u2019t a little teary too, then the Nothing has already won. You may as well watch Krull instead.",

Those she has made include addresses at the time of the Gulf war in 1991, on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, following the death of the Queen Mother in 2002, and at the time of her diamond jubilee celebrations in 2012.\nThe Prince of Wales paid his own tribute to the national effort in combating the disease when he officially opened NHS Nightingale London, via video link from his Birkhall home in Scotland on Friday.\nCharles praised the \u201cspectacular and almost unbelievable feat of work\u201d undertaken to build the field hospital at the ExCeL conference centre in east London in just nine days.\nThe hospital offered \u201can intensely practical message of hope to those who need it most at this time of national suffering\u201d, he said.\n\u201cLet us also pray that it will be required for as short a time and for as few people as possible.\u201d\nCharles, who is out of self-isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 having experienced mild symptoms, said it was an \u201cexample if ever one was needed how the impossible can be made possible and how we can achieve the unthinkable through human will and ingenuity\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cOn behalf of the nation I want to say a very big thank you to the planners, the builders, the armed forces, the generous companies and organisations which have donated equipment and services and all the support staff who have made this possible.\n\u201cAlso we owe an immense debt of gratitude to the doctors, the nurses, technicians and staff \u2013 currently working in the health service and those coming out of retirement - and the voluntary workers who have been working within it.\n\u201cAnd I can only offer my thoughts and prayers to those who will receive care within it and let us hope it will not be too long before this terrible disease has left our land.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIn this dark time this place will be a shining light. It is symbolic of the selfless care and devoted service taking place in innumerable settings by countless individuals throughout the United Kingdom.\u201d",

        "content": "Mexico\u2019s homicide rate raced to a new record in March, as violence raged even as Covid-19 spread across the country and authorities urged the population to stay home and practise social distancing.\nMexico registered 2,585 homicides in March \u2013 the highest monthly figure since records began in 1997 \u2013 putting 2020 on track to break last year\u2019s record total for murders.\nThe surge in killings comes as federal and state officials put resources into containing the Covid-19 crisis and confront the prospect of an already sluggish economy falling even further \u2013 potentially deepening the misery for the more than 40% of the population living in poverty.\n\u201cIt\u2019s business as usual [for drug cartels] with a risk of further escalation, especially if at some point the armed forces are called away for pandemic control,\u201d said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group.\nViolence has flared throughout the country, but it has been especially intense in the central state of Guanajuato, where criminal groups have battled over lucrative territories rife with theft from pipelines.\nThe bloodshed has hit shocking levels in the city of Ceyala \u2013 home to a major automotive manufacturing plant \u2013 with gunmen engaging security forces in shootouts, blockading streets and torching businesses.\nFrancisco Rivas, director of the National Citizen Observatory, which monitors security issues, attributed the increasing violence in Guanajuato to the fallout of the federal government trying to stamp out petrol theft.\nThe crackdown weakened the local Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, Rivas said, prompting the rival Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG) to move in and attempt to take its territory.\nOther causes for rising violence, Rivas said, include growing pains with a new militarised police known as the national guard, the lack of a federal strategy and cutting the security budget to its lowest level in 20 years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing violence hitting its peak and we\u2019re left asking, \u2018who\u2019s going to stop it?\u2019\u201d Rivas said.\nCalder\u00f3n sends in the army\nMexico\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d began in late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, ordered thousands of troops on to the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoac\u00e1n.\nCalder\u00f3n hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counterproductive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico\u2019s military went on the offensive, the body count skyrocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.\nKingpin strategy\nSimultaneously, Calder\u00f3n also began pursuing the so-called\u00a0\u201ckingpin strategy\u201d\u00a0by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.\nThat policy resulted in some high-profile successes \u2013 notably Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva, who was\u00a0gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009\u00a0\u2013 but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.\nUnder Calder\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government\u2019s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world\u2019s most murderous mafia groups.\nBut Calder\u00f3n\u2019s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa\u2019s Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.\nWhen \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was arrested in early 2016, Mexico\u2019s president bragged: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d. But the violence went on. By the time Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.\n'Hugs not bullets'\nThe leftwing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo, as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime,\u00a0offering vocational training\u00a0to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels.\n\u201cIt will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and [social] welfare,\u201d Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his \u201chugs not bullets\u201d doctrine.\nAmlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong national guard. But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.\nMexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders a day.\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said on Friday that a drop in violence had been expected towards the end of March when coronavirus cases had started increasing in Mexico, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t turn out like that.\u201d\nL\u00f3pez Obrador came to power promising to solve Mexico\u2019s security woes by tacking what he considered the root causes of crime: poverty and corruption. But the strategy has so far failed to rein in the violence.\n\u201cThe [anti-crime] strategy isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d said Rivas. \u201cThe national guard isn\u2019t pulling its weight because building an institution is difficult and expensive. Budget cuts to public security have been brutal. These all have serious effects.\u201d\nThe president stirred further outrage during a visit to Sinaloa state on Sunday, when he stopped to greet the mother of convicted cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 breaking with social-distancing protocols to shake her hand.\nL\u00f3pez Obrador downplayed the greeting as little more than a courtesy to a mother who hadn\u2019t seen her son in five years, but his comments prompted outrage from families of victims of violence, who say he has failed to extend the same courtesy to them.\n\u201cFor society and victims, who have been having a hard time meeting or being listened to by the president,\u201d Ernst said, \u201cit\u2019s a heavy slap in the face.\u201d",

        "content": "Jason Hargrove died less than two weeks after expressing concern about passenger coughing without covering her mouth\nIn late March, Jason Hargrove, a public bus driver in Detroit, posted a live Facebook video about a woman coughing on his bus several times without covering her mouth.\n\u201cThat lets me know that some folks don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, in an emotional live stream. \u201cYou all need to take this shit seriously. There\u2019s folks dying out here.\u201d\nLess than two weeks later, he died of coronavirus, Detroit\u2019s mayor announced in a press conference on Thursday.\nThe president of the local transit union told the Detroit Free Press that Hargrove had started feeling sick just a few days after he posted the video. Hargrove\u2019s death \u201cshould touch everyone in the country\u201d, Mayor Mike Duggan said. \u201cEveryone in Detroit and everybody in America should watch it,\u201d he said of Hargrove\u2019s video. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can watch it and not tear up.\u201d\nThe mayor pledged to extend additional safety protection measures to all public bus drivers, similar to ones already in place for the city\u2019s police officers and firefighters.\nThis article includes content provided by Facebook. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nIn his 21 March Facebook live video, recorded outside and inside a bus, Hargrove, visibly shaken, describes a female passenger in her 40s or 50s who coughed \u201cfour or five\u201d times on the bus without attempting to cover her mouth.\n\u201cI feel violated,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel violated for the folks that were on the bus when this happened.\u201d\nThere were at least eight or nine passengers on the bus while the woman was coughing, he said, and she made no attempt to cover her mouth. There was no excuse for that kind of carelessness, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re telling you every day what to do: if you cough, cough in your arm. Sneeze in some tissue,\u201d he added.\n\u201cFor us to get through this and get over this, man, you all need to take this shit seriously,\u201d he warned.\nHe said in his live stream that he was not trying to blame anyone else \u2013 not the mayor, not the city, not the state of Michigan, not the president \u2013 except the woman who coughed. \u201cIt\u2019s her fault,\u201d he said.\nHargrove said he had tried to disinfect his bus afterwards, and promised that he would take off all his clothes and shower as soon as he got home so he wouldn\u2019t bring the virus home to his family.\nThe day after Hargrove posted his video he updated his Facebook profile picture with an icon of a bus as a reminder that he was serving on the frontlines of the epidemic: \u201cI cannot stay home,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m on the road 4 u.\u201d\nMichigan is emerging as one of America\u2019s troubling coronavirus hotspots, with nearly 11,000 confirmed cases and more than 400 deaths as of Wednesday. The virus has taken a toll on many public employees in Detroit, including the city\u2019s police chief. The mayor said on Thursday that 106 members of Detroit\u2019s police department, and 24 members of the fire department, have tested positive for Covid-19, while hundreds more are in quarantine.\nPublic health data from the state of Michigan shows coronavirus is having a disproportionate toll on the state\u2019s black residents. In a state where only 14% of the total population is black, at least 35% of people who have been confirmed to have coronavirus, and 40% of the dead, are black.\nFour days before Hargrove\u2019s live stream, Detroit\u2019s public bus drivers had shut down most of the city\u2019s bus service for the day to protest for safer conditions for themselves and their passengers.\nIn response to drivers\u2019 concerns, the city announced on 17 March, the day of the protest, that all bus fares would be eliminated during the pandemic, that buses would be cleaned more regularly, that drivers would receive gloves and sanitary wipes, and that passengers would be required to board and exit at the back door of the bus, rather than the front door, directly by the drivers.\nDuggan announced additional protections for bus drivers on Thursday, including daily temperature checks for drivers, closer health monitoring and the option for drivers with vulnerable family members at home to stay free of charge in a hotel room, so they would not put their families at risk.\nHargrove leaves behind a wife, the Amalgamated Transit Union said in a tribute to him on social media.",

        "content": "Frustrated NHS staff and scientists say they have labs ready but cannot get the materials\nThe UK government\u2019s pledge to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month is unravelling, with NHS laboratory staff and scientists warning they do not have the test kits, chemicals and components they need to scale up.\nBoris Johnson is personally calling the major companies that make test kits to try to secure the UK supply, it has emerged, in competition with prime ministers and presidents from around the world.\nNHS lab staff and biomedical scientists talk of intense frustration, saying they have the labs ready but cannot get the materials, which include test kits, reagents and plastics such as small tubes and pipettes.\n\u201cOn behalf of the biomedical scientists and laboratory staff of the NHS, the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) wants to express the frustration of our members and clarify that we are testing to the limit of our materials and that we are ready to increase capacity \u2013 but only if we are given what we need,\u201d they said in a statement.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, talked with confidence of achieving 25,000 virus tests a day for those ill in hospital and NHS staff who have symptoms or are in a household with somebody who is sick, so that they can go back to work. These are PCR (polymerase chain reaction) swab tests, sometimes erroneously called antigen tests, which need to be processed with specialised kits in a lab.\nTesting for Covid-19 has increased and exceeded a previous target of 10,000 per day, though later than the government initially promised.\nHancock\u2019s bigger goal of carrying out 100,000 tests in England by the end of the month includes antibody tests \u2013 the fingerprick blood test that could be done at home. Hancock said he had bought 3.5m test kits and is known to have ordered millions more from nine companies, but the first tests to be put through validation at Oxford University have failed.\nOn Friday, after the latest figures revealed a further 684 people with the virus had died in the UK, Hancock said he was \u201cabsolutely determined to hit the new goal\u201d.\nBut when asked about the IBMS warning at the Downing Street press conference, he acknowledged: \u201cYes, that will involve some challenges, there\u2019s no doubt, including making sure we get hold of all of the parts and all of the reagents. And everybody can see there are challenges around the world.\u201d\nAllan Wilson, the IBMS president, said he did not understand the strategy. \u201cMixing antibody and antigen tests doesn\u2019t add up to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an antibody test that is any use at this stage so how can you include that in the 100,000 and not say what the mix within that 100,000 is of antibody and antigen tests? It\u2019s just a bit of a muddle still.\u201d\nWilson, the lead biomedical scientist in cellular pathology at his NHS trust, says they could deliver 100,000 tests for the virus every day \u2013 but only if they got the supplies that are currently either available only in tiny quantities or non-existent.\nThere are shortages of the test kits themselves, \u201cbut also of some very basic reagents, such as the virology transport medium that we need to put the swabs in. The actual swabs are in short supply \u2013 effectively they are rationed in my patch in Scotland but I know there are problems in England as well.\u201d\nThe lysis buffer, used in extracting the RNA of the virus, was \u201cin very, very short supply\u201d, he said. So are precision plastics \u2013 \u201cthe little tubes and pipettes, so each test gets its own individual tube\u201d. Those will not be available until mid-May.\n\u201cThis is affecting countries across the world and there is nothing more the workforce can do to increase testing capacity any further,\u201d said the institute in its statement. \u201cWe would urge caution as testing is ramped up to ensure that the supply chain is secured.\n\u201cThe very real risk is that hospitals and pathology networks will run out of reagents and patients will not be able to be tested and this will not only impact upon their care but can lead to hospitals unable to manage all patients safely as has been seen in other countries.\u201d\nCharlie Swanton, the chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, who is turning the whole of the Francis Crick Institute into a testing lab, supports the government scaling-up of testing. However, he said his team were experiencing difficulties in obtaining test kits and even getting space on planes to have them delivered.\n\u201cWe have some tests. We haven\u2019t got enough yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to secure our supply chain. We just need to get that in the institute building and then we will be happier. We don\u2019t want to have to suddenly change the test three weeks from now. It is a constant worry. You\u2019d be amazed how many blocks to the supply chain there are even in a simple diagnostic assay like this.\u201d\nSwanton, too, spoke of a global shortage of lysis buffer. \u201cAnd then to make matters worse, because all the airlines have grounded their planes, there is no cargo space. So we\u2019re having to solve all these problems. It\u2019s like marshalling a small army. It\u2019s been very tough.\n\u201cThe other big problem is that we are competing, not just nationally but internationally for access to these reagents \u2013 and competing is a horrible term because we are all trying to help the same people. We\u2019ve got to be very conscious of that in the UK, that we\u2019re not depriving other hubs and other laboratories. But we hope to be able to share what we can.\u201d\nA handful of big companies, mostly based in the US, supply test kits for the virus with emergency approval from regulators in the US or EU. They include the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which has been in discussions with Public Health England (PHE).\nRoche, credited with enabling up to 500,000 tests a week in Germany, has already opened three labs for PCR swab testing in Manchester, London and Gateshead, it emerged on Friday. It plans to open at least six more in the coming weeks for Public Health England with a lab in Wales opening on Monday and Northern Irish and Scottish sites to follow.\nThe government said on Friday it was already operating five testing sites for health workers including one in Boots headquarters in Beeston in Nottingham, and would expand the number of mostly drive-in sites to 50 in the coming weeks.\nDoris Ann Williams, the CEO of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, said Johnson was himself calling the companies to try to increase UK supplies of testing kits.\n\u201cThe pinch point is availability from the manufacturers of PCR test kits needed to work on their dedicated instrumentation. The prime minister is intervening with the global heads of the companies involved to understand when they may be able to supply more test kits,\u201d she said.\nThe manufacturers were doing all they could, she said. \u201cHowever, there is global demand and manufacturing capacity is being increased at pace, along with the logistics to distribute it but none of this can be achieved overnight.\u201d\n This article was amended on 4 April 2020. An earlier version said Roche was thought to be central to plans for a mass testing facility in Milton Keynes; Roche later stated it was not involved in the hub. Text stating that PCR tests are \u201csometimes called antigen tests\u201d has been clarified to note that this alternative name is erroneous.",

Intensive care units are becoming overloaded across the London region.\nOur own is now ventilating almost three times the number it was designed for, spilling out across adjacent wards and operating theatres on scavenged ventilators and skeleton staffing.\nStill the tide keeps coming. We are keeping sicker and sicker patients on the wards just because there is no capacity to ventilate them.\nWe are becoming stricter and stricter about who we are able to offer ventilation to; soon many of our own staff would not meet the criteria.\nThese conversations become harder and having them so many times per day is exhausting. The Nightingale is opening at least one week too late.\nThe upcoming weekend terrifies me.\nI am angry that for the last week I have almost certainly had Covid-19 myself. I am lucky, of course, but because we have hardly any testing for staff and I did not have a fever or continuous cough, I was cleared as safe to continue working without a test. Who knows whether I was safe or not?\nThe tiredness has been crippling and I have crawled straight into bed after 14 hour days. I am feeling a bit better now but have profound anosmia that has robbed me of any ability to taste my food. But at least I am OK.\nI am angry that so many of my colleagues are sick.\nSome departments, my own included, have over half our staff off. We have \u2013 apart from a few exceptions \u2013 not run out of protective equipment, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. People are sickening anyway. My worry is that some will get seriously ill, and some will die. Some already have.\nIn a callous, brutal way, I can only hope they are not people I know. I don\u2019t think I could stomach that.\nI am angry that we have had to go cap in hand to larger partners, in effect begging for equity in staffing.\nMost teaching hospitals have an army of university-affiliated doctors doing research, or super-specialist clinics, or complex surgeries, and each have pulled these doctors into their own hospitals now that these activities have been cancelled.\nThis includes hospitals without emergency departments, which fully staff empty wards until they receive patients referred on a case-by-case basis from other hospitals.\nContrast this with a smaller hospital, already full before the crisis began, with no pool of additional resource to call on for a sudden unexpected shift to 24/7 working. There have been direct refusals to share staff and the unfairness takes my breath away.\nSurely the only sensible answer is to convene a regional panel to fairly allocate staffing between hospitals based on need; once again the lack of high-level leadership lets us down.\nI am angry that I cannot switch off. At home, at work, in the car, this is all there is now. Everything else seems trivial, monochrome, unimportant by comparison.\nTo my shame this has started to include me and my family. How can I care about my kids\u2019 birthdays or my parents\u2019 loneliness when people are dying unnecessarily?\nHow do I enjoy a day off at home when I\u2019m still expected to dial in to two, three calls and there are constant WhatsApp messages and emails for advice and urgent decisions? I worry how long I can sustain this for.\nMost of all, though, I am angry that despite all of our preparations we will be overwhelmed through no fault of our own. We prepared well. We were responsive, organised, calm, ready. What we have achieved already is truly remarkable. Now, though, we will just be yet another hospital with patients being treated in corridors, exhausted staff, insufficient ventilators and people dying because we can\u2019t treat them properly.\n The writer is an NHS respiratory consultant who works across a number of hospitals",

        "content": "Mayor says NEC field hospital will be ready to take patients as data shows 21% of deaths in England were in Midlands\nHospitals in the West Midlands are forecast to reach maximum capacity by next weekend, the region\u2019s mayor has said, amid growing concern that one in five deaths from coronavirus in England have happened in the Midlands.\nAndy Street said the West Midlands appeared to be the UK\u2019s next hotspot after London and that Birmingham\u2019s new field hospital would be ready to open by next Saturday or Sunday when admissions are expected to peak.\nAnalysis by the Guardian has found that 21% of the 3,302 deaths reported in English hospitals to date have occurred in the Midlands, while University hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust has recorded the third highest number of deaths of any trust in the country at 102 deaths.\nStreet said the Nightingale hospital at the Birmingham NEC arena would initially take 500 patients but have capacity to hold even more than the 3,000 at London\u2019s ExCeL \u2013 potentially making it the biggest medical facility in the UK.\n\u201cThe expectation, given the modelling of how this disease is spreading, means that we will need the capacity at the NEC Nightingale hospital at about the time it\u2019s due to open,\u201d Street said.\nA separate political source said there was growing alarm about a lack of ventilators for patients suffering the worst effects of the virus. The source said there were only 240 ventilators in the West Midlands and that the region would need 2,500 by 11 April, when patient numbers are expected to peak.\nToby Lewis, the chief executive of Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said: \u201cClearly this area \u2013 Birmingham and the Black Country \u2013 is the absolute priority for ventilator provision and it is fantastic that the NHS have recognised that. We are seeing equipment arriving today and more equipment arriving tomorrow.\n\u201cThat is very, very important because across the NHS locally at the moment we are training staff to work in slightly different areas in the ones they work in currently so it is really important that we have the equipment in place to give staff the confidence in the care that they are going to provide but I am very clear that this time tomorrow we will have more ventilators to work with as will neighbouring institutions.\u201d\nNick Page, the chief executive of Solihull council, said a further 253 ventilators would be delivered on Saturday to Solihull and the Black Country.\nStreet said hospitals in the West Midlands were coping with the huge influx of coronavirus patients with a \u201cherculean effort\u201d but that they were soon expected to reach capacity. Officials in the region believe its number of cases is tracking about two weeks behind London.\nThe Conservative mayor, a former managing director of John Lewis, described transforming the NEC into potentially the UK\u2019s biggest field hospital as \u201cour Dunkirk moment\u201d and said it had taken \u201ceye-watering effort\u201d and coordination across multiple sectors. A temporary mortuary with space for up to 12,000 bodies is being built at Birmingham airport, next to the NEC.\nSo far 693 deaths from coronavirus in England have been registered in the Midlands \u2013 2second only to London, where almost a third of all deaths in the country have been recorded.\nAs well as University hospitals Birmingham, two other Midlands trusts are among those with the highest death count: the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust has recorded 81 deaths \u2013 the fourth highest number of deaths in England \u2013 while Sandwell West Birmingham has reported 68 deaths.\nOne NHS area in Birmingham has also recorded the highest number of triages in the country, with 44,000 calls and online contacts resulting in individuals being told that their symptoms were in keeping with Covid-19. However, the city has not recorded the most coronavirus triages when population size is taken into account.\nThe reasons behind the high number of deaths and confirmed cases in the Midlands are not clear. Birmingham is the country\u2019s second biggest city by population \u2013 with 1.1 million residents \u2013 so a high number of cases is not unexpected. Some academics have suggested the region\u2019s industrial past, combined with high levels of smoking, could be a cause.\nThe Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood said religious backgounds could also be playing a part and that elderly Muslim and Sikh people in the region were struggling to adhere to government guidelines on social distancing.\nPublic Health England is believed to be examining transmission patterns to see if anything unusual is happening in the Midlands but it could be weeks or months before that analysis becomes clear.\nAdditional reporting: Dan Sabbagh and Nazia Parveen",

        "content": "Visits in some areas come to almost complete halt as coronavirus lockdown hits\nFootfall at British retailers is down 85% over the past two months, according to location data gathered by Google, with some areas effectively coming to a complete halt as the government\u2019s lockdown hits.\nVisits to retail and recreation establishments in Rutland, Britain\u2019s smallest county, were down 100% compared with the pre-February baseline, while four other areas \u2013 Bath and North East Somerset, Midlothian, Nottinghamshire and York \u2013 all recorded drops of 90% or more.\nHowever, the data suggests the sight of bare shelves could be coming to an end: at grocery and pharmaceutical shops there was a large increase in footfall at the beginning of last month, peaking at almost 30% by mid-March, but in the last two weeks the trend sharply reversed, with the retailers seeing huge drops in traffic \u2013 46% nationwide \u2013 despite being exempt from the lockdown.\nThat pattern, of a spike followed by a slump, is common across almost the whole nation. But some areas bucked the trend: in Dundee, for instance, there was almost no increase in foot traffic to grocers, suggesting the panic buying that swept the nation bypassed the Scottish city. Conversely, Thurrock in Essex had one of the largest spikes, topping out at 40% higher than normal, and one of the steepest falls with traffic now down 53%.\nGoogle\u2019s data also enables international comparisons: the US, for instance, is far behind the UK in encouraging widespread physical distancing. Retail and recreation is down just 47% there, while grocery and pharmacy visits have fallen 22%. But the car-centric nation has recorded a proportionally steeper decline in public transport use, down 51%, suggesting more Americans were able to cut back on that than on shopping.\nThe data comes from the vast corpus of information Google collects on all its users in order to offer services such as Google Maps, as well as targeted advertising. \u201cInsights in these reports are created with aggregated, anonymised sets of data from users who have turned on the location history setting, which is off by default,\u201d the company said. \u201cNo personally identifiable information, like an individual\u2019s location, contacts or movement, is made available at any point.\u201d\nThe company said the reports, which cover almost the whole world \u2013 with China a notable exception \u2013 \u201cwill be available for a limited time, so long as public health officials find them useful in their work to stop the spread of Covid-19\u201d.\nThe release demonstrates the sort of information that governments have been requesting from technology and communications firms since the crisis hit. In the UK, for instance, the government has received aggregated location data from mobile carriers, allowing it to track the success of its physical distancing guidelines. In the US, some Facebook data, filtered through the company\u2019s disease mapping project, has served a similar purpose, although the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also received location data from mobile advertising companies.",

Looking back, it feels like he lost.\nGattis was with the Astros for their historic run, which since has been disgraced by revelations of a sign-stealing scheme that cost general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager AJ Hinch their jobs and a one-year ban from baseball. The repercussions swept up two other managers \u2013 the New York Mets fired Carlos Beltran and the Boston Red Sox parted with Alex Cora - who were part of the scheme in Houston in 2017.\n\u201cEverybody wants to be the best player in the fucking world, man,\u201d Gattis told the Athletic\u2019s 755 Is Real podcast. \u201cAnd we cheated that, for sure. And we obviously cheated baseball and cheated fans. Fans felt duped. I feel bad for fans.\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking for sympathy or anything like that. If our punishment is being hated by everybody forever, just like, whatever. I don\u2019t know what should be done, but something had to fucking be done. I do agree with that, big-time. I do think it\u2019s good for baseball that we\u2019re cleaning it up. ... And I understand that it\u2019s not fucking good enough to say sorry. I get it.\u201d\nAstros All-Stars Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve apologized publicly in brief statements at the start of spring training in February.\nGattis, who retired after the 2018 season, isn\u2019t the first member of the 2017 team to air a guilty conscience. Blue Jays reliever Ken Giles, the Astros\u2019 closer in 2017, said he would give his World Series ring back if asked.\nBaseball launched an investigation after former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers, now with the Oakland Athletics, told the Athletic details of the sign-stealing operation, which included reviewing signs from a digital replay room and banging a garbage can a certain number of times based on the pitch that was coming.\nThe Astros were stripped of first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021 and were fined $5m, but MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said the team would not lose its World Series title.\nThe 33-year-old Gattis said he didn\u2019t think Hinch liked the team cheating by stealing signs and said Beltran and others didn\u2019t put pressure on players to participate.\n\u201cNobody made us do shit. You know what I\u2019m saying? People saying this guy made us, that guy made us, that\u2019s not it. But you have to understand the situation was powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou work your whole life to try to fucking hit a ball, and you mean you can tell me what\u2019s coming? It was like, \u2018What?\u2019 It\u2019s a powerful thing, and there\u2019s millions of dollars on the line and shit? And that\u2019s the bad of it, too, that\u2019s where people got hurt. And that\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not playing the game right.\u201d\nFormer Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Mike Bolsinger filed a civil lawsuit against the Astros, alleging the sign-stealing caused a four-run, 29-pitch outing that effectively ended his career.",

        "content": "Britain has good expertise in diagnostics, but few firms with enough capacity to produce\n\u201cUnlike some countries, we didn\u2019t go into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry. We have the best scientific labs in the world, but we did not have the scale,\u201d Matt Hancock said this week, facing a barrage of questions on why the UK is lagging behind others on coronavirus testing.\nThe UK\u2019s health secretary said his German counterpart could call on 100 test labs and rely on the heavy presence of Roche, one of the world\u2019s largest diagnostics companies, to achieve its current level of more than 50,000 tests a day. The UK had had to build from a lower base, he said.\nIndustry players say this is a fair characterisation. \u201cWe have a lot of diagnostics capability in this country but what we don\u2019t have is the global diagnostics giants,\u201d said Tony Cooke of Cambridge Clinical Laboratories. \u201cEven when we have our own companies, a lot of the supplies are coming from the US or Germany.\u201d\nThe UK is not alone in struggling to meet demand. France has carried out even fewer tests than the UK, and Spain tried to bridge supply chain issues by buying millions of test kits from China that later had to be withdrawn after giving flawed results.\nAs well as Roche, which has developed a single machine that can churn out 1,000 test results a day, Germany also has Qiagen, a major supplier of genetic testing kits, which are being used to diagnose Covid-19. Both companies also produce reagents and components used in kits put together by other manufacturers. The US has called on Abbott, Thermofisher, Quest Diagnostics and Hologic.\nThe more distributed hospital lab system in countries such as Germany and Italy has also served them well in being able to increase testing for Covid-19. The NHS has spent years centralising its testing labs, which under normal circumstances was both economical and clinically robust. It has allowed labs to be aligned to standard diagnostic criteria and to use the same test kits, reagents and equipment from the same suppliers, allowing bulk purchases from single suppliers at a competitive price.\nDuring a pandemic, however, this dependency on a handful of non-domestic suppliers, such as Roche, for kits and reagents becomes a fundamental flaw.\nAllan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, says the UK could have done a better job of surveying its diagnostic landscape and built a strategy around existing strengths, which include having a large number of research labs and smaller, but highly innovative diagnostics companies.\nThe re-engineering of HIV testing machines into 90-minute Covid-19 tests by Diagnostics for the Real World in Cambridge, which within a week will meet the entire testing requirements of Addenbrookes hospital in the city, is an example of the type of approach that could have been encouraged nationally.\n\u201cWe were slow to make that decision in testing and we approached it in too narrow a perspective,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it regional locally, people forming and forging partnership arrangements, looking for support from universities and commercial companies.\u201d\nIndustry figures say that more could be done in future to nurture some of these startups and medium-sized companies into home-grown giants.\nThere is a record to show that innovative businesses started in the UK have this potential, but that beyond a certain level of success the companies tend to migrate to the US where venture capital and buyers are in more ready supply.\nMedisense, which was spun out of Oxford University in the 1990s, revolutionised the blood glucose sensing industry in the 1990s, then was acquired by the US company Abbott. Solexa, a genetic sequencing company spun out of Cambridge, was acquired by Illumina in the US for about $650m in 2007 and is now worth about $40bn.\nGordon Sanghera, the chief executive of the sequencing and diagnostics company Oxford Nanopore, whose technology was used to characterise the very first example of the coronavirus in Wuhan, said Hancock\u2019s acknowledgement of the need to nurture a domestic industry was welcome and should not be forgotten after the crisis has passed.\n\u201cHancock\u2019s declaration that the UK needs a new diagnostic industry is right, and we have plenty of seeds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the collaboration with the broader scientific community, and looking at access to capital for UK companies, that will make those seeds grow and bear fruit that helps people not only in the UK, but all around the world.\u201d",

At the top of the pile is likely to be:\nShould Labour argue that UK\u2019s exit from the single market be delayed because businesses are too busy dealing with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis to prepare for new trading arrangements?\nIf the new leader argues for a pause in talks, that risks looking like a refusal to accept the referendum result and would give Boris Johnson and new Tory MPs in traditional Labour seats an enormous stick to beat the party with. However, if the party argues against a postponement, this could alienate Labour\u2019s predominantly pro-EU base and many in the business community.\nSome Labour MPs believe Keir Starmer, the leadership frontrunner, has been missing in the current debate, leaving the floor open to unlikely critics such as Jeremy Hunt and the Daily Telegraph.\nBut despite criticisms, the government is riding high in the polls and the public appears to be demanding a united front during a national crisis. The new leader will have to decide when it is appropriate to criticise the government \u2026 and when to hold back.\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s critics wish to see his successor take swift action against anyone who has been found to have made antisemitic comments or implicated in covering up the extent of antisemitism in the party.\nAn inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into Labour is ongoing. Jewish community groups have asked that the new leader begins a clear out of those who failed to act swiftly against antisemites. Should the leader wait for a conclusion of the EHRC inquiry, or make a move?\nSome Corbyn supporters are calling for the new shadow cabinet to be a \u201cbroad church\u201d and offer roles to the departing leader\u2019s supporters. Starmer has already said he would offer a job to his opponent Rebecca Long-Bailey, a Corbyn follower, in a future shadow cabinet. Corbynites will want to ensure it is a significant job and not an effort to sideline her.\nLabour under Corbyn had become reliant on the deep pockets of Len McCluskey\u2019s Unite the union, a source of cash that may well dry up if Starmer wins and pushes out McCluskey\u2019s allies Karie Murphy and Jennie Formby. If Starmer is victorious, would Unison step in? Would he be able to rely on members\u2019 donations or might Labour seek corporate donors once again?",

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\n\u201cJust like the Nightingale hospital, one of these was put together in just nine days, which is breathtaking speed, these trials are looking at the effectiveness of existing drugs and steroids repurposed for treatment for Covid-19.\n\u201cOne of the trials, which is called recovery and deals in hospital care, is the largest of its kind in the world, with 926 patients involved.\u201d\nHancock, who recently emerged from a week of self-isolation after being diagnosed with coronavirus, said more patients were needed to volunteer to take part in the trial. The \u201cbigger the trials, the better the data and the faster we can roll out the treatments\u201d, he said.\nThe deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, said doctors would approach suitable patients about taking part in clinical trials in the UK. \u201cFirst of all, we need the physicians in charge of their care to sign up for the clinical trial. Then it is up to the physician to approach the patient and ask them if they would like to take part,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a process of very careful written informed consent for that to happen. The straight answer is yes, we do need people to take part in the clinical trials, and they are doing.\u201d\nVan-Tam said he expected it to be a few months before the drug trials yielded results. \u201cIt will all depend on how quickly patients are recruited into the trials across the NHS,\u201d he said.\nBoris Johnson, who was also diagnosed with Covid-19 last week, announced that he would have to stay in self-isolation in his flat at 11 Downing Street longer than the seven-day minimum because he still had a temperature.\nThe Department of Health confirmed that, as of 5pm on Thursday, 684 more people had died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total deaths in the UK to 3,605. Hancock insisted on Friday there was capacity in the NHS to deal with the crisis, with 2,029 critical care beds currently unoccupied, not including those at the newly opened NHS Nightingale.\nAfter growing criticism of the government\u2019s failure to pursue a strategy of mass testing for coronavirus as advocated by the World Health Organization, Hancock made a new pledge on Thursday to complete 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of the month.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really delighted by the response since I set that challenge down at this press conference yesterday,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cMore people have come forward saying that they can turn their capabilities to increasing testing and we\u2019re going to have to hit that target.\u201d\nHancock indicated earlier that the coronavirus outbreak could reach its peak in the UK on Easter Sunday, with about 1,000 deaths a day in the lead-up. But speaking at the press conference on Friday evening, he cautioned against over-interpreting his comments, saying the spread of the virus depended on how people adhered to lockdown rules.\nWith the weekend\u2019s weather forecast to be sunny and mild, England\u2019s chief nursing officer, Ruth May, told the press conference that members of the public should not to be tempted to go outside. She urged them to remember the two nurses who had died from the virus.\nEchoing a plea by the prime minister earlier in the day, she said: \u201cThis weekend is going to be very warm and it will be very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays. But please, I ask you to remember Aimee [O\u2019Rourke] and Areema [Nasreen]. Please stay at home for them.\u201d",

She said that patients in the ward where she was working, which was not a coronavirus treatment ward, felt comfortable with her wearing the surgical mask and some positively encouraged her to do so.\nThe letter continued: \u201cUpon arriving to work on Tuesday morning, whilst still wearing a mask, you asked me for a word in your office. You outlined to me that wearing a mask wasn\u2019t following the trust policy and asked me to remove it. I responded stating that I wasn\u2019t pleased with this instruction and defended myself stating that I was uncomfortable not wearing a mask while dealing with patients who may be carriers of Covid. However I adhered to the request.\u201d\nShe said that later that day, while taking blood, a patient coughed into her unprotected face but, despite relaying details of the incident, she was still refused permission to wear her mask.\nBrennan wrote: \u201cWith a heavy heart and sadness, I feel I have no alternative but to hand this letter in as my formal resignation and will be unable to work my notice due to not being allowed to wear sufficient PPE for the duties I perform.\u201d\nHer resignation comes as the government sought to quell a backlash from healthcare workers over PPE. On Thursday, the government and public health bodies upgraded the recommended PPE that healthcare professionals should be wearing amid criticism that the existing guidelines did not offer them enough protection.\nBut employers and unions warned that the upgrade would mean nothing without resolving the shortages that have led to clinicians improvising with snorkels and school science goggles.\nAt the daily Downing Street press conference on Friday, England\u2019s chief nursing officer, Ruth May, invoked the deaths of Nasreen and O\u2019Rourke as she urged members of the public to stay at home. \u201cThis weekend is going to be very warm and it will be very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays,\u201d she said. \u201cBut please, I ask you to remember Aimee and Areema. Please stay at home for them.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI worry that there\u2019s going to be more and I want to honour them today.\u201d\nThe face mask issue is particularly pertinent as the World Health Organization (WHO) is considering changing its guidance on whether people should wear face masks in public amid suggestions that their widespread use have played a role in containing outbreaks in some Asian countries.\nOn Thursday, in an about-turn, the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, advised people in the city to cover up their faces, following in the footsteps of Los Angeles. De Blasio stressed that \u201chomegrown\u201d protection was fine in a bid to prevent a run on the professional grade masks coveted by clinicians.\nNo 10 said on Friday that its advice continued to be that face masks are unnecessary outside. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told Good Morning Britain: \u201cMasks are very important to protect healthcare workers ... but that [asking the public to wear them] isn\u2019t something that we\u2019ve done here because \u2026 the whole basis of our response has been making sure that we follow the science.\u201d\nExperts remain divided on the issue but a study published in Nature Medicine on Friday, which included WHO-affiliated researchers, suggested surgical face masks may be effective in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from symptomatic individuals.\nDr Rupert Beale, group leader of the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute, said the study, which he was not involved in, presented \u201cstrong and compelling evidence in favour of mask wearing as a means of reducing transmission of some viruses, including coronaviruses. Public health officials must immediately take note of this important new evidence.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, raised concerns with the health secretary that nurse deaths were not being counted amongst the official coronavirus mortality figures.\nOn BBC\u2019s Question Time, Kinnair pushed Matt Hancock to release statistics relating to healthcare staff. She said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t even counted the nurses yet. I keep asking for the stats on nurses,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that, we will sort that out,\u201d Hancock replied.\nPaying tribute to Nasreen, Toby Lewis, chief executive of the neighbouring Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said it was clear from experiences in other countries \u2013 particularly Italy, where dozens of nurses and doctors have died \u2013 that healthcare workers were at risk.\n\u201cThey are at risk not only from the patients we look after but from each other. There is additional grief counselling and psychological support being provided to staff because they are working in situations that are very different to those that they have worked in,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWill more healthcare workers pass away? With the greatest regret I think that is a certainty. [However] it is our collective effort to try and minimise the number of tragedies that we see in the number of people who serve within the NHS.\u201d\nNasreen, whose family have asked the media not to publish her picture, developed symptoms of coronavirus on 13 March, including aches, a high temperature and then a cough. She tested positive for the virus on 27 March.\nIn a tribute posted on Facebook, her friend Rubi Aktar said: \u201cShe was the most lovely, genuine person you could ever meet, she went above and beyond for everyone she met.\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful that I had the honour to call her my best friend. She saw me at my best and my worst and accepted my every flaw. I am so broken that words can\u2019t explain.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s daughter Megan Murphy described her mother as an \u201cangel\u201d. She wrote on Facebook : \u201cLook at all the lives you looked after and all the families you comforted when patients passed away. You are an angel and you will wear your NHS crown forevermore because you earned that crown the very first day you started!\u201d\nNHS England has insisted that PPE shortages are down to distribution problems rather than shortages but many remain sceptical. On Friday, a group of organisations including Doctors in Unite and the Doctors\u2019 Association UK issued a demand that the government repurpose industry to produce adequate quantities of PPE, including face masks, preferably to the highest specification.\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cIn the past two weeks the NHS supply chain have delivered 397m pieces of PPE equipment. While we are confident that enough supply is now reaching the frontline, we appreciate there were limited distribution problems to begin with while we dealt with a new demand caused by this emerging epidemic.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Hillingdon Hospitals NHS trust said: \u201cOur trust takes the safety of all our staff extremely seriously and we follow national guidelines, as set out by Public Health England. We regularly update staff on the types of PPE and the rules for its use. Today [Friday] we are making sure our staff have sight of and understand the latest guidance on PPE that was released late yesterday. We are also providing extra support to our staff during the current emergency both for their physical and their mental health and wellbeing.\u201d",

        "content": "Tributes point to fact that first four to die were all from minority ethnic backgrounds\nAs tributes were paid to the first four doctors who died from coronavirus in the UK, it did not go unnoticed that, profession apart, they also had another striking similarity \u2013 they were all from a BAME background.\nDr Alfa Saadu, 68, Amged el-Hawrani, 55, and Adil El Tayar, 64 and GP Dr Habib Zaidi, 76, had ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nOlamide Dada, the founder of Melanin Medics, said black, Asian and minority ethnic doctors often featured in negative stories, for example about racism, but the details of their work on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus showed they deserved to be treated with respect.\n\u201cThis shows that they just wanted to serve, their contributions are equally important as the next person, whether they have been born in the UK or not,\u201d she said.\nThe fact that the first doctors to die were all from BAME backgrounds is less surprising when placed in the context of the makeup of the NHS workforce. As of March 2019, 20% of the more than 1.2 million staff employed by the health service were BAME, compared with 14% of the general population of England and Wales (based on the last census).\nThe proportion increases to 44% when it comes to medical staff. The latest figures show that 43% of senior NHS doctors and 47% of junior doctors were BAME as of March last year.\nSajda Mughal, the chief executive of the Jan Trust, which works with women from BAME backgrounds, said: \u201cIt\u2019s highlighting the big contribution to the NHS. They are on the frontline saving lives. Unfortunately, they lost their lives. I\u2019d like to see more funding for the NHS but also more support for BAME communities because this shows how vital they are to British society.\u201d\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cMany of those who have died who are from the NHS were people who came to this country to make a difference, and they did, and they\u2019ve given their lives in sacrifice, and we salute them.\u201d\nIt was a far cry from the language of the now abandoned \u201chostile environment\u201d. Just over two years ago, during a four-month period, more than 1,500 visa applications from doctors with job offers in the UK were reportedly refused as a result of a cap on the number of tier two visas issued to workers from outside the European Economic Area.\nDespite their contribution, ethnic minority medics have often struggled for equal treatment. Doctors from BAME communities are too often viewed as outsiders by their NHS bosses and peers and not given the support they need, according to a report published last year, which was commissioned by the General Medical Council to examine why they are twice as likely to face disciplinary action as white doctors.",

        "content": "Bob Kerslake says lessons will need to be learned as UK may face same situation again\nThe scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the civil service has said. \n Sir Bob Kerslake said the scope of the decision-making undertaken by politicians and officials had been vast, and, as some of it had already been challenged, there would need to be a chance to reflect upon the UK\u2019s response in case of another pandemic.\n\u201cThere will need to be some sort of inquiry after we get through this to learn lessons,\u201d said Lord Kerslake, who is a crossbench peer. \u201cThis is one where we might face the same situation again.\n\u201cI hope that even during this clear crisis moment there is a proper record being kept of who made decisions and why, because that will be very, very important. Not to lay blame \u2013 though clearly there will be a bit of that \u2013 but to plan for the future. We could face this again and it could be even worse.\u201d\nKerslake also warned Downing Street against appointing people with election skills and backgrounds in political messaging over those with the exact skills for the task in hand.\nHis intervention echoes repeated acknowledgments by ministers that their decisions are likely to be scrutinised at a future inquiry and No 10 accepts that this is likely to be on the horizon.\nA senior Tory source said questions over testing, the government\u2019s initial consideration of herd immunity, ventilator stocks, the way ideas have been briefed to the press, and the delivery of personal protective equipment would all be issues any inquiry might want to look at.\nThey said: \u201cThere has to be a public inquiry about how decisions were taken and what was happening beforehand while the virus was still in Wuhan in China. What was the planning, what was flagged to who and when?\u201d\nAn ex-No 10 staffer said no one working on coronavirus from within Downing Street would be overly concerned about a forthcoming inquiry, but they would always have \u201cone eye\u201d on what would be subject to a freedom of information request and any leaks of information, particularly when they involved worst-case scenario planning.\nDowning Street is said to be urgently bringing trusted people back on board to help deal with the crisis, including Isaac Levido, the head of the Tories\u2019 successful 2019 general election campaign. He has been tasked with improving the party\u2019s public health communications campaign.\nTom Shinner, a civil servant who was formerly head of no-deal Brexit planning, has been drafted back into Downing Street to coordinate Whitehall\u2019s response to Covid-19.\nKerslake said Shinner had clearly impressed the government over Brexit and that Levido was known for his skills with election communications, but that the job now required a firm grasp of data and science.\nHe said: \u201cThis is more about how do you keep the public on side because this requires massive voluntary effort. People have to choose to follow the rules and how do you keep confidence with the public.\n\u201cThe communication task goes beyond producing messaging. If that\u2019s all Levido does, I\u2019m not sure he will add a lot, but if he can recognise the \u2026 task that\u2019s needed now and how different it is to an election campaign, then he might bring something to it. If he does a rerun of the election, he\u2019s got it wrong.\u201d\nA No 10 insider said Shinner was a brilliant civil servant and exactly the right person to work on Covid-19. The senior Tory source said they were worried about the new appointees \u2013 particularly Levido \u2013 because of their political background.\nThey said: \u201cYou need people who understand the logistical challenges. Experts in disaster relief. A lot of these people already exist within government who look after crisis briefs. Winning elections is good but undoubtedly this is different.\u201d",

One election official said he feels \u201csick\u201d asking people to work the polls, knowing it could kill them. Others have advised some voters to isolate their mail-in ballot envelopes for 24 hours before getting a witness to sign it to avoid spreading the virus. And Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called for the election to be delayed.\nIn Milwaukee, home to around 300,000 registered voters, there will be just five election day polling locations, instead of the usual 180. Days ahead of the election, Neil Albrecht, executive director of the city\u2019s elections commission, didn\u2019t know where those sites would be or who would staff them. The city usually requires 1,400 poll workers, but had just 400 earlier this week.\n\u201cWe are over our heads in chaos right now,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cThe level of public confusion will be so rampant and the access to voting will be so limited.\nOn Friday, Wisconsin\u2019s governor, Tony Evers, ordered the legislature to meet in special session at 4pm on Saturday to decide the fate of the election. Evers is pushing to convert to an mail-in election ending on 26 May. Republicans said Friday afternoon they would not take up the proposal.\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m speechless. And not optimistic,\u201d Albrecht said of the special session.\nElections officials in Wisconsin told the Guardian they are stunned the state is moving forward with in-person voting at a time when the governor has issued a formal order instructing people to stay at home. The 7 April election will be the most significant test of whether a state can safely conduct a fair election amid a global pandemic.\nSo far, using aggressive public messaging, Wisconsin has successfully convinced more than 1.2 of its 3.3 million voters to request a mail-in ballot. That is unprecedented \u2013 in its 2016 spring election, the state issued just under 250,000 mail-in ballots.\nBut there is still deep concern that confusion and rules around mail-in voting will leave many unable to participate. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the state to ease some of its restrictions around absentee balloting. Republicans are appealing the ruling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be imperfect, some voters will be disenfranchised,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be inequality and access to the ballot that will affect the election outcome.\u201d\nThe hurdles could impact the state\u2019s presidential primary election, local races and a critical contest for a state supreme court seat where Democrats are looking to narrow the conservative majority.\nUntil Friday, Evers, a Democrat, has rebuffed calls to postpone the election, citing the need to fill local offices in the state as terms expire and saying he does not have unilateral authority to move the primary. In late March, Evers called for mailing an absentee ballot to every voter, a Sisyphean feat so close to election day. Democrats have criticized Evers\u2019 response, and Republicans who control the Legislature immediately called it a \u201cfantasy\u201d.\nMeanwhile, voters applying for mail-in ballots have been faced with confusion around the quickly changing rules. Normally Wisconsin requires people to submit a picture of their ID to get an absentee ballot, and all voters needed a witness to sign their ballot. These restrictions have been especially hard for senior citizens, as well as students and other people who move a lot, Burden said.\nPatricia Ginter, a 72-year-old real estate agent who lives alone in Wauwatosa, said in a court filing she has only left her house once in the last few weeks to go to the grocery store. She filled out her absentee ballot, but has no way of getting a witness because she\u2019s in isolation. Ginter is a plaintiff in one of several federal lawsuits challenging restrictions around Wisconsin absentee ballots.\nA Wisconsin elections commission memo said people like Ginter could rely on delivery people to observe voters filling out their ballot through a window, or mail the witness certificate to someone who could observe over video chat. Lawyers representing Ginter and the other plaintiffs called those guidelines unworkable.\nOn Thursday, however, the US district judge William Conley eased some of those rules and said Wisconsin voters could submit an absentee ballot without a witness signature if they provided a declaration they could not get one, and left local clerks with the authority to determine validity. He said cities like Milwaukee, which has already received hundreds of ballots without witness signatures, could count them with the declaration as well.\nThe judge called the election \u201cill-advised\u201d but said he had no authority to stop it.\nMeanwhile Wisconsin\u2019s controversial identification rules have not been eased. Officials in Madison said Wednesday they received over a thousand requests for a mail-in ballot from people without acceptable ID \u2013 about half of which were from senior citizens.\nWe are unable to process over 1,100 absentee requests because we do not have the voter's ID on file. About half are senior citizens who sent us selfies. If you know a senior citizen staying safe at home, please contact them to ask whether they need help sending ID to their Clerk.\nPeter German, a freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, moved home to West Bend, after his campus shut down for Covid-19. He requested his absentee ballot on 26 March, but as of Thursday had yet to receive it. The local clerk\u2019s office told him his ballot was sent to an address in a different town. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a confusing process so far,\u201d he said.\nTo account for the severe delays, Conley extended the deadline by which local election officials have to receive ballots from 8pm on election night to nearly a week later, at 4pm on 13 April. Conley also blocked election officials from releasing election results until the later date.\nThe change will probably allow thousands of Wisconsin voters to have their votes counted. And provide relief to election officials like Albrecht, who said he needs 300 workers to count ballots and had less than 50.\nLocal officials still plan to run a small number of in-person voting sites \u2013 significant because voters can register to vote on election day. In previous spring elections, about 20% of voters in Milwaukee made use of that process, Albrecht said, and disproportionately voters of color.\n\u201cWhen we talk about communities in poverty, which is where we\u2019re seeing the hotspots of the pandemic, getting to the voting center may not be as accessible to you,\u201d he said.\nBut the Wisconsin elections commission reported a shortage of at least 7,000 poll workers. And there is valid reason for many of them to drop out: poll workers tend to skew older, the demographic most likely to develop severe complications from Covid-19. Two poll workers in Florida tested positive for coronavirus after the election there last month.\nThe Dane county clerk, Scott McDonell, said he has a draft email in his inbox asking county workers to step in, but feels sick at the prospect of putting those workers at risk and hasn\u2019t been able to bring himself to send it. Meanwhile, Milwaukee closed all of its in-person early voting sites, and the city, along with Madison, is offering a site where voters can drive up and drop off their ballot instead.\nIn Waukesha, one of the most populous cities in the state, officials got rid of all but one of the 13 voting sites. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty that we are conducting an in-person election at all during this time,\u201d said Kevin Lahner, the Waukesha city administrator.\nMany states are watching Wisconsin as a case study in switching from in-person voting to mail-in ballots amid Covid-19. For now, Albrecht, whose city has been at the center of some of the most brutal voting rights battles over the last few years, is bracing for Tuesday.\n\u201cI\u2019m completely stymied, for lack of a better word, how this election can move forward,\u201d he said.\nKayla Huynh contributed to this report.

        "content": "The Trump administration decided to end a $200m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China.\nThe project, called Predict, had been run by the US Agency for International Development since 2009. It had identified more than 160 different coronaviruses that had the potential to develop into pandemics, including a virus that is considered the closest known relative to Covid-19.\nA decision to wind down the program was made, however, in September, just three months before the first reports of people becoming infected with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China. The end of the program saw the departure of dozens of scientists and analysts working to identify potential pandemics in countries around the world, including China.\n\u201cIt was a genius, visionary program that USAid took a big risk to fund and it\u2019s a crying shame it was canceled,\u201d said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit specialist in tackling wildlife-borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program.\nDaszak said he did not know why the initiative was scrapped or if the White House played any direct role in its ending. EcoHealth Alliance has been given a temporary extension to work on the program but the role will finally come to a close in September.\nThe news about Predict\u2019s demise was first reported in the Los Angeles Times.\nPredict\u2019s work focused on the dangers of viruses spreading from wildlife to humans and causing possible pandemics like the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt. It is suspected that Covid-19 made the leap to humans from a bat sold at a Wuhan market.\nDaszak said there are an estimated 1.7m mystery viruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic, making the early detection of these diseases imperative for public health and economic reasons.\n\u201cWe should\u2019ve been more unsettled about this before all this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a lot of flak for spending money in other countries but just think how much even a few billion would be worth to stop this sort of pandemic. It\u2019s sad to see the project finish because it\u2019s the way of the future, in 50 years they will be bog-standard.\n\u201cI\u2019m not confident we will learn the lessons from this, though. We saw the same thing happen after Ebola and then Zika. We are always behind with pandemics, we are flying blind. We have hit the snooze button several times and now here\u2019s the big one.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear whether a continuation of the project would have dampened the current pandemic, although the Trump administration has faced criticism for its preparation before the outbreak. The administration reduced a team working in China on pandemics and has repeatedly attempted to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nA spokesman for USAid told the Los Angeles Times that the Predict program was \u201cjust one component of USAid\u2019s global health security efforts and accounted for less than 20% of our global health security funding\u201d. A new initiative to help prevent the spread of diseases from animals to humans is due to start later this year.",

        "content": "Sacramento area church says it has been unfairly blamed in the spread as health officials link a third of cases to places of worship\nA California megachurch has found itself at the center of a coronavirus outbreak after public health officials connected it to 71 cases , even as church leaders say they have been unfairly blamed for failing to take action to stop the spread among church members.\nCounty health officials have put Bethany Slavic Missionary church, a Pentecostal house of worship in a suburb of Sacramento, at the heart of one of the largest outbreak clusters in the country. The church is reported to be the largest Slavic congregation in the US, with 3,500 members and a total attendance at some services of up to 10,000.\nThe county\u2019s public health director said that a third of all coronavirus cases in Sacramento county have been linked to places of worship. As of Thursday, health officials tallied the number of county cases at 350, with 10 deaths.\nSeventy-one of the members who tested positive live in Sacramento county, and members who live in other counties may also be infected. One parishioner has died, officials said, and a pastor indicated in an online sermon the church\u2019s senior pastor has been hospitalized and two others are critically ill.\nHealth officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the Sacramento county public health director, Peter Beilenson, told the Los Angeles Times it is \u201coutrageous this is happening\u201d, adding that public health guidelines trump the freedom of religious expression.\nBeilenson said Thursday that in-person services at the Slavic megachurch have now ceased.\nBut he said church leaders rebuffed previous attempts to discuss the cases. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically told us to leave them alone,\u201d Beilenson told the Sacramento Bee. \u201cThis is extremely irresponsible and dangerous for the community.\u201d\nChurch leaders did not immediately respond to phone calls from the Guardian, but a pre-recorded voicemail greeting said that most church services have been moved online.\nPlaces of worship across the county have in recent weeks found themselves in the spotlight after resisting or being slow to enforce social distancing norms. Hugs, handshakes, or passing a common donation basket can easily pass the virus from one person to the next.\nFaith Presbyterian church, also in Sacramento, has had two parishioners die from the virus and a total of five people test positive for the virus, the Sacramento Bee reported.\nForty minutes south, in Lodi, church leaders sent the city a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter after police entered the church during a service on 25 March, telling authorities the church \u201cintends to continue to meet this Sunday and all future Wednesdays and Sundays\u201d.\nLeaders from Bethany Slavic Missionary church did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a press release published by the church contests information released by county health officials and media outlets.\nThe release states that a church leader said in a 14 March video address that the church \u201cwill comply with all regulations and guidance from the CDC. It also challenges the number of cases that have been linked to the church and said it was never informed any of its members had died.\n\u201cIt has been reported that 71 members of this church had fallen ill. These reports are believed to be inaccurate and falsely place the emphasis on this church,\u201d the release says.\nIt adds that the county\u2019s total number of cases linked to places of worship \u201chas been falsely linked to Bethany Slavic Missionary Church. Media repetition of such unfounded representations invite ridicule, hatred, and violence against our church community.\u201d\nIn an interview with a local ABC affiliate, Beilenson said the county released the name of the church out of concern for public safety.\n\u201cThe reason that we\u2019re disclosing this is not to cause pariahs or cast aspersions at anybody, but to really hammer home the importance of congregating, not only in church, but also in prayer meetings in people\u2019s homes,\u201d said Beilenson.\nOn Friday, the Sacramento county health department released additional information in response to the church\u2019s press release, confirming the numbers it had reported and saying the county coroner only informs family of the deceased as to cause of death.\n\u201cWhile we know that the church as a whole has ceased to meet and the leadership is hosting online services, we have been told by multiple sources that there are groups that continue to meet in homes, despite the public health order to not gather with anyone outside of household members. These gatherings have been directly linked to the clusters of cases in the community,\u201d the health department said.\n\u201cIn no way does Sacramento county condone ridicule, hatred or violence toward this church, any other church, or any member of society.\u201d\n The photo caption on this article was amended on 6 April 2020 to make clear that the picture shows the California State Capitol in Sacramento.",

        "content": "The CDC has issued new guidance on wearing non-medical masks as a voluntary public health measure \u2013 and the first lady supports it\nDonald Trump has said his administration is encouraging Americans to wear face masks in public to prevent spreading the coronavirus \u2013 but does not intend to wear one himself, despite his own wife\u2019s advice.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance for people to wear bandannas, t-shirts and other cloth-based coverings in crowded areas, especially in hot spots.\n\u201cThe CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure,\u201d the US president told reporters on Friday. \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d\nYet later on Friday evening, first lady Melania Trump tweeted: \u201cAs the weekend approaches I ask that everyone take social distancing & wearing a mask/face covering seriously.\u201d\nAt the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was pressed to explain his unwillingness to lead by example and offered a characteristically unconventional reply. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself. They say \u2018recommendation\u2019, they recommend it. I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d \u2013 a remark that ignored evidence that many virus carriers do not show symptoms.\nHe went on: \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be doing \u2013 somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d\nThe guidance on face covering has shifted over time. Previously only the sick or those at high risk of complications from the virus were advised to wear masks. Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, tweeted at the end of February that people should \u201cSTOP BUYING MASKS\u201d and said they were not effective in protecting the general public.\nOn Friday, Adams admitted the evolution of the guidance on masks \u201chas been confusing to the American people\u201d. He said the original advice was based on the best information available at the time and that the World Health Organization recommended against using them.\nBut now, Adams said, it is known that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of people with the virus lack symptoms and can transmit it before they show symptoms, for example by coughing, sneezing or speaking. \u201cIn light of this new evidence, CDC recommends, and the task force recommends, wearing cloth-based coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies.\u201d\nAt Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump was not accompanied by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spoke at the podium on Thursday about his growing role in the supply chain.\nKushner, who has no medical qualifications, raised eyebrows by claiming that states should use their own equipment stockpiles first, adding: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d\nHours later, the administration suddenly changed the description of the strategic national stockpile on government websites, switching the emphasis from it being the country\u2019s biggest supply for use in a public health emergency to it supplementing state and local supplies. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well,\u201d it now says.\nAt the briefing, Trump was challenged by Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent of CBS News, over Kushner\u2019s use of the word \u201cour\u201d. He dismissed it as a \u201cgotcha\u201d question, responding: \u201cIt means the United States of America. And then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states. We need it for the government and we need it for the federal government ...\n\u201cAs an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We\u2019re gonna bring them to various areas of the country that need them. When he says \u2018our\u2019 he\u2019s talking about our country. He\u2019s talking about the federal government.\u201d\nIncreasingly riled as he sought to defend a family member, Trump told Jiang, a woman of colour: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s such a basic, simple question and you try to make it sound so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself ... You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.\u201d\nThe tension between federal and state governments in the distribution of ventilators, masks, gloves and other equipment has been a defining feature of the incoherent US response to the virus. Trump reeled off numbers of supplies Washington is sending to states, including 8.1m masks to New York, which has been hardest hit.\nBut Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, tweeted on Friday: \u201cWe do not have enough ventilators. Period.\u201d\nPressed on whether he can assure New Yorkers that they will have a sufficient quantity, Trump said bluntly: \u201cNo. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators at the time. They should\u2019ve had more ventilators, They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do \u2013 we are doing our best for New York.\n\u201cYou know, we have states, we have a lot of states \u2013 we have territories too \u2013 but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of. Some much more so than others. We happen to think he\u2019s well-served with ventilators. We\u2019re gonna find out.\u201d\nWhereas Fauci has called for a nationwide state-at-home order, Trump continues to argue that the main responsibility lies with the states. \u201cI leave it up to the governors,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI like that from the standpoint of governing.\u201d\nCritics say the administration was caught napping by the pandemic and has mobilised the buying and manufacturing of equipment way too late. But Trump took a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, complaining: \u201cThe previous administration, the shelves were empty.\u201d\nAs Trump also continues to attack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and massive job losses leave people uninsured, there are growing concerns over access to health care for millions. But the White House said on Friday it would cover the costs of coronavirus treatment for uninsured people, drawing on $100bn set aside in the emergency rescue package passed by Congress last week.\nFriday\u2019s briefing also produced a very Trumpian moment as he referred to the models projecting the virus\u2019s spread and death toll. He said: \u201cThe models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come way under the model. The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model \u2013 at least, this kind of a model.\u201d",

        "content": "Michael Atkinson, inspector general for the intelligence community, alerted Congress to whistleblower complaint\nDonald Trump has fired the inspector general for the intelligence community who handled the whistleblower complaint that led to his impeachment, prompting fierce criticism from Democrats.\nThe US president chose a Friday night, with America consumed by the coronavirus pandemic, to tell the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees of his decision to dismiss Michael Atkinson.\nIn a letter, Trump claimed it was \u201cvital\u201d that he had confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general, and \u201cthat is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general\u201d.\nThe president would nominate an individual who has his full confidence at a later date, he added.\nThere was swift condemnation from Democrats. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cPresident Trump fires people for telling the truth.\n\u201cMichael Atkinson is a man of integrity who has served our nation for almost two decades. Being fired for having the courage to speak truth to power makes him a patriot.\u201d\nAdam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee and a prominent figure in the impeachment hearings, described the move as \u201cyet another blatant attempt by the president to gut the independence of the intelligence community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAt a time when our country is dealing with a national emergency and needs people in the intelligence community to speak truth to power, the president\u2019s dead of night decision puts our country and national security at even greater risk.\u201d\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress think tank in Washington, tweeted: \u201cLeave it to Trump to use a global pandemic as cover for his retaliation against those who helped bring to light his wrongdoing. Disgusting.\u201d\nAtkinson was the first official to alert Congress last year to an anonymous whistleblower complaint that described a phone call in which Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to announce an investigation into his political rival, Joe Biden.\nIn letters to Congress in August and September, Atkinson said he believed the complaint was urgent and credible. But Joseph Maguire, who was acting director of National Intelligence at the time, decided it was not urgent and tried to withhold the complaint from Congress.\nUnder huge political pressure, the White House eventually released the complaint, triggering an investigation by the Democratic-controlled House, which charged Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and voted to impeach a president for only the third time in history.\nTrump was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate in February in what critics described as a show trial with no documents or witnesses allowed. Nevertheless, the president claimed he had been vindicated following a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and purged two officials who testified.\nTrump chose Atkinson, who had served in the justice department for 15 years, for inspector general in late 2017 and he was confirmed in May 2018. At his Senate confirmation hearing, Atkinson promised whistleblower protection that \u201cvalidates moral courage without compromising national security and without retaliation\u201d.\nIn November last year, the New York Times reported that Trump had discussed with aides the possibility of firing Atkinson because he could not understand why the inspector general failed to dismiss the complaint. In a tweet, he suggested that Atkinson should be forced to testify at the impeachment hearings.\nThe removal of Atkinson fits a long pattern of retribution against the intelligence community. In May 2017 he fired James Comey, the director of the FBI, who was leading an investigation into his contacts with Russia during the presidential election.\nMore recently Maguire was also ousted and replaced by Richard Grenell, who had been US ambassador to Germany and is a strong Trump backer. The president has nominated Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe to the permanent position but he must await Senate confirmation.\nLast month more than a hundred intelligence and national security professionals signed a joint letter warning that Trump \u201chas created an existential danger to the United States\u201d and endorsing Biden for president.",

As his young heroine ascends the social scale she learns to avoid dialect words, \u201cthose terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel\u201d, and call them \u201cwild hyacinths\u201d instead.\nBluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) spend most of their time underground. The bulbs are self-burying, burrowing deep where the soil is soft. As they grow, the roots contract, hauling themselves down more than 10cm into the woodland floor.\nOnce a year, each plant sends up a few long pointed leaves to pierce the surface. In Dorset, these begin to appear in January, poking out of the mulch like bunches of green plastic straws. The smooth, slightly shiny leaves are triangular in section, with one side developing a folded groove. Despite their robust appearance, the plants are highly sensitive to crushing. Trample them and you damage their ability to photosynthesise, and they can take a long time to recover.\nBy mid-March, in sheltered places and sunny weather, they begin to lift flower stems, each tipped with a head of greeny-purple buds. Bluebells are part of the Asparagaceae family and it\u2019s at this stage, when their poisonous ends look a little like asparagus spears, that the botanical relationship is clearest.\nAnother few days and the stems lengthen, the ends droop and the bells begin to hang in elongated drops, each on its own thin stalk. Crouch down close and you can catch a faint bloom of scent, the smell of spring being released from the earth.\nBluebells are rich in nectar and creamy-white pollen, which provides one of the best early food sources for insects. Bumblebees sometimes bite through the bottom of the flower in their hunger to reach the nectary.\nThis April, many of us will be starved of outdoor sweetness and will have to imagine the perfume and colour seeping through the woods.",

Media outlets such as Global Times and CGTN toned down the colours on the websites and Twitter accounts to simple tones of grey.\nMore than 3,300 people in mainland China have died the coronavirus, which surfaced in the central province of Hubei late last year. On Friday, the country reported 19 new cases, the vast majority linked to foreign travel, and more than 1,030 asymptomatic patients were under medical observation.\nIn Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the centre of the outbreak, all traffic lights in urban areas turned red at 10am and all road traffic ceased for three minutes. Some 2,567 people have died in the city of 11 million people, accounting for more than 75% of mainland China\u2019s coronavirus fatalities.\nAmong those who perished was Li Wenliang, a young doctor reprimanded by police in Wuhan for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d when he tried to raise the alarm about the disease. He was later exonerated.\nIn the US on Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance for people to wear bandannas, t-shirts and other cloth-based coverings in crowded areas, especially in hotspots, advice Trump said he would not follow.\n\u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself. They say \u2018recommendation\u2019, they recommend it. I\u2019m feeling good,\u201d \u2013 a remark that ignored evidence that many virus carriers do not show symptoms.\nHis wife, Melania, later urged everyone to take the coronavirus measures seriously.\nAs the weekend approaches I ask that everyone take social distancing & wearing a mask/face covering seriously. #COVID19 is a virus that can spread to anyone - we can stop this together.\nAt Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump was not accompanied by Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spoke on Thursday about his growing role in the supply chain.\nThere were further economic warnings, with World Bank Group president David Malpass saying the pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d, echoeing comments by the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, who called on advanced economies to do more to help emerging markets and developing countries. \u201cThis is a crisis like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis\u201d of 2008.\nChina\u2019s day of mourning coincided with the start of the annual Qingming tomb-sweeping festival, when millions of Chinese families often travel to pay their respects to their ancestors.\nHowever, in Wuhan all tomb-sweeping activities have been banned until at least the end of the month, and many are still in lockdown, leading authorities to encourage the use of online streaming services that allow them to watch cemetery staff carrying out the task.\nOn pavements and in housing compounds, some residents burned joss paper, a tradition believed to send money and wealth to deceased relatives.\nOnline, celebrities including Fan Bingbing swapped their glamorous social media profile pictures for sombre photos in grey or black, garnering millions of \u201clikes\u201d from fans. Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent suspended all online games on Saturday.\nAs of Friday, the total number of confirmed cases across the country stood at 81,639, including 19 new infections, the National Health Commission said. Eighteen of the new cases involved travellers arriving from abroad. The remaining one new infection was a local case in Wuhan, a patient who was previously asymptomatic.\nChina reported 64 new asymptomatic cases as of Friday, including 26 travellers arriving in the country from overseas. That takes the total number of asymptomatic people currently under medical observation to 1,030, including 729 in Hubei.\nReuters contributed to this report",

Citizens stood with heads bowed, while cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rang out. Among the 14 health workers and police declared to be remembered was Li Wenliang, the doctor who was reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d before being exonerated. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel, and more than 1,030 patients who are asymptomatic are under medical observation.\nWorld Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. He echoed comments by the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, who called on advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impacts. \u201cThis is a crisis like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis\u201d of 2008.\nHealth officials in the US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside. But President Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying he can\u2019t see himself wearing one when he greets \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d. Melania Trump later urged everyone to take the official advice seriously.\nIt was confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive.\nUS attorney general William Barr has issued an emergency order for the release of more federal inmates into home confinement, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing emergency conditions. Barr has given priority to vulnerable inmates housed in federal prisons that have been hardest hit by Covid-19, including facilities such as Oakdale in Louisiana, Elkton in Ohio and Danbury in Connecticut, where inmates have died. The BOP said on Friday 91 inmates and 50 staff in its 122 institutions had fallen ill, though reports suggest the number of those affected is much higher.\nThe Falkland Islands government confirmed the territory\u2019s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and was now in a stable condition in isolation.\nPolice have detained thousands across Central America for violating rules put in place by their governments to curb coronavirus transmission. Honduran authorities said about 2,250 people had been arrested for violating the curfew imposed since mid-March while Guatemalan authorities said 5,705 people had been detained for leaving their homes without justification.\nIn Panama, more than 5,000 people have been detained in recent weeks for violating curfew rules; another 424 people have been held for not complying with recent rules that limit men and women leaving the house on alternate days.\n Meanwhile, in El Salvador, 712 people have been detained for failing to comply with the mandatory home quarantine decreed by President Nayib Bukele, and have been taken to containment centres.",

        "content": "Former England manager on his \u2018perfect\u2019 2010 World Cup plans, selection issues and how Lampard\u2019s ghost goal still haunts him \nThe fact Fabio Capello saw it coming and had warned them made it harder to take. \u201cThe most incredible thing that\u2019s happened to me,\u201d he calls it, which is saying something for a man who spent 56 years in the game, won the European Cup, four league titles as a player, nine as a manager, and has been to the World Cup with three countries.\nOne of those was England in 2010. It was not particularly memorable but the Italian can\u2019t help it, not when Frank Lampard\u2019s \u201cghost goal\u201d haunts him even now 10 years on.\n\u201cEveryone saw it,\u201d Capello says. \u201cBesides, because of the effect on the ball, when it hits the bar, the floor \u2013 the pitch was dry \u2013 and goes up like that, it can only have gone in: it\u2019s physics.\u201d But the goal wasn\u2019t given and rather than drawing level with Germany in the last 16, England still trailed and were soon out. Capello says the decision was \u201chistoric\u201d but it also hurt because he could see it happening.\n\u201cThere had been a conference in Sun City in February: an hour about the ball, 45 minutes about referees. The preparation was perfect, they said. This, that, the other. And I said to the referees\u2019 chief: \u2018Why not put someone behind the goal, a fifth official?\u2019 \u2018No, we\u2019ve decided this way\u2019\u2026\u201d\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/02-57075-gnl.fw.200402.jf.PhilippeAuclair.mp3\nThere is a grin, irony etched on that familiar face. Capello sees himself before the same men four months later. He slaps his hand, hard. \u201cLook! I said this would happen,\u201d he begins. \u201cWe worked for two years and because of someone else\u2019s mistake we\u2019re going home. Because you didn\u2019t put someone there. What\u2019s he sitting in the stands for? Put him behind the goal. It was there! I told them that in February.\u201d\nTrue but it does not change the fact that in 2010 England were \u2013 how can we put this? \u2013 not very good. Whatever mistakes the referees made, were not more made by the team and their manager? The catalogue is a long one. Time, then, to go through it, page by painful page. Capello sits on the sofa at Sam Mam\u00e9s in Bilbao, where he\u2019s about to address the Bilbao International Football Summit, and, edging towards a low table, begins.\n\u201cRooney had problems, he wasn\u2019t right,\u201d he says, a little enigmatically. \u201cBeckham got injured, Ferdinand got injured: important players, with charisma, leadership, players you need. We got there and played without conviction.\u201d\nThe question is simple: why? The answer is complex, a portrait of multiple system failure.\nStarting with the simple, let\u2019s address the most basic question: why did England go 10 years without finding a good fit for Lampard and Steven Gerrard? \u201cBecause they played in the same place,\u201d Capello says. Why not remove one, then? \u201cBecause the other players aren\u2019t better,\u201d he replies, laughing, swiftly dismissing the suggestion he employed Gerrard on the left. \u201cNo, only when defending: when we had the ball, he was free.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we played, I didn\u2019t see the same comfort,\u201d Capello continues. \u201cWe played a pre-tournament friendly and I could already see something was missing. Afterwards people said things like we were based too far away [from everything], the players were holed up and didn\u2019t like it, it was too long, too hard. That\u2019s nonsense, stupid. The preparation was perfect.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d he says, which is something he says a lot, \u201cin my life, I played one World Cup: the greatest thing. I used to wait in anticipation for the squad announcement. I didn\u2019t go to Argentina 78 having played throughout qualification. Now, that hurt. Being at a World Cup is a sacrifice? Twenty days is a sacrifice? What about the people there working for the team, up at five every morning? That\u2019s sacrifice. It\u2019s not a sacrifice to play.\n\u201cPeople said: \u2018They\u2019re not used to it.\u2019 Not used to it! You\u2019re there to work. You have the whole of England behind you. And four years later they were in the centre of Rio and were sent home early too ... so \u2026\u201d\nSo?\n\u201cThe England shirt weighs heavy,\u201d Capello says. \u201cSo much time has passed without winning. \u201966 is a problem because whenever a World Cup or Euros starts, they think they can do it again. Always, always, always. It\u2019s important to play without that weight, with more freedom. A lot is psychology but, honestly, I think the problem England have is they arrive at tournaments tired.\n\u201cIn September, October, November, we had no problem playing the world\u2019s best teams. In March, April, so-so. In June, problems. That\u2019s why I think it is physical. You play a lot of [club] games and your culture is: fight, fight, fight, never stop, even if you\u2019re four down. I liked that.\u201d\nAnd yet, Capello thinks, it costs. Not that it was the only factor and he believes it is different for Gareth Southgate. \u201cMy team was a bit old. We didn\u2019t have young players and in the past there was tiredness. Now they have good young players. Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling are important. There\u2019s quality, speed, everything. If I have a doubt now, it\u2019s the centre-backs but England have lads who are younger, fresher.\u201d\n\u201cYou also need confidence and England have that now,\u201d he continues, pausing to add with a wry smile: \u201cNow they have a goalkeeper \u2026\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t? \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve always had bad luck with goalkeepers internationally. The goalkeeper is very, very important, as much as a striker. Anyone who wants to win a title has to have a goalkeeper.\u201d\nIn South Africa, Capello had Rob Green, who let a harmless Clint Dempsey long shot slip under his body against USA. Green later talked about a culture of fear, a lack of communication. At its most basic level, that is a recurring theme of Capello\u2019s era, it is also an accusation he dismisses, if not always entirely convincingly.\n\u201cPeople said the players didn\u2019t understand my English but it\u2019s football: 20 words [are enough],\u201d he says. He says so in Spanish, incidentally. Communication was no problem, then? \u201cNo, absolutely not. It was in Russia and China, but not England.\u201d\nFew words were spent on dropping Green, certainly: Capello told him he was out and the conversation ended there. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything. Everyone makes mistakes. He made one, so I changed. I put in Calamity James.\u201d\nYes, that is how he refers to David James \u2013 without missing a beat.\n\u201cI had Green and I had [Joe] Hart, just a kid. I asked the players. Hart or Calamity? \u2018Calamity.\u2019 I put Calamity in because of the players\u2019 trust. John Terry and the defenders had more faith in James. Hart had played only once.\u201d\nGreen also claimed Capello had fat-shamed the squad, telling three-quarters of them they were overweight. Also true, Capello concedes, spreading his hands. \u201cThey came like this. You explain, tell them what to do. They\u2019re professionals. The problem is, they arrive at the end of the season. \u2018We\u2019re used to eating this, used to doing this, not used to that.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to change \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t have leaders [among players] to guide them.\u201d\nIn part, though, that was precisely what Capello had come for, chosen as a corrective to perceived lax discipline under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, a break from Baden-Baden. \u201cIt\u2019s not discipline,\u201d Capello insists. \u201cIt\u2019s respect for the shirt: you represent a country. You\u2019re not there for fun; you\u2019re there to work, for the game, for English spirit. At a club you might need [a warmer, closer relationship] but not a national team. There\u2019s the maximum respect. We\u2019re focused to the target and that\u2019s it.\u201d\nThat last line is the only one delivered in English. \u201cAll that stuff is nonsense, always has been,\u201d Capello concludes.\n\u201cLook, one thing I do think,\u201d he says, after a short pause. \u201cIn the first game against USA, it\u2019s a gift from Green. In the second game [England 0 Algeria 0], we played so-so. The third game, Slovenia [a 1-0 win] \u2026 I almost don\u2019t remember it \u2026 and then there\u2019s the last one against Germany and \u2026\u201d\nAnd? \u201cThere is something very important, something that whenever I think about it still lingers here,\u201d he says, pointing to his head.\n\u201cGermany was a young team, very young. Listen: a young team that goes from 2-0 to 2-2 has a psychological problem. For us, that\u2019s a tremendous boost. But that wasn\u2019t to be [because Lampard\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t given] and I can\u2019t get it out of my mind. It\u2019s still there, still there. I would have liked to see the second half then. We hit the bar, had chances, and on the break they score the third, then a fourth. I could see it: we were growing, getting better, and then \u2026\u201d\nAnd then Capello stops and slaps his hands together and it\u2019s all over.",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Saturday 4 April.\nThe number of cases in Australia reached 5,544 on Saturday and the death toll rose to 30. A woman in her 70s died in hospital in Victoria on Friday night and a man in his 80s died at the Canberra Hospital in the ACT on Saturday. NSW recorded an additional 104 cases, Victoria recorded 30 new cases and Western Australia 14, nine of which are Western Australian and five linked to the Artania cruise ship. NSW Health said on Saturday that 110 people in quarantine in Sydney hotels had been tested for coronavirus after showing symptoms. They were expected to receive their results on Saturday.\nThe deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, advised the wider public against wearing face masks, in part due to supply constraints, and also because \u201cincorrect use can actually make it more dangerous\u201d. He said that authorities were continuing to look at mask use and advice may change in the future.\nNew South Wales police conducted the largest maritime operation in Sydney Harbour outside of wartime to move crew and supplies between a series of stranded cruise ships before they depart Australian waters. Guardian Australia understands crew members on four Royal Caribbean ships \u2013 Celebrity Solstice, Ovation of the Seas, Voyager of the Seas and Spectrum of the Seas \u2013 are being sorted into groups according to their country of origin before the ships depart Australian waters. Crew members have expressed concerns that the effect of the transfers will be to spread the contagion across several ships.\nThe New South Wales health minister has defended health officials after leaked emails showed the doctor on board the Ruby Princess told authorities on 18 March that people who had presented at the onboard medical clinic with flu-like symptoms had tested negative for influenza. The next day, 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark and make their way home before test swabs had been analysed by state health authorities. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay has described the incident as one of the most significant health failures in the state\u2019s history and called on Hazzard to stand down.\nChanges have been made to some temporary visas to support essential industries during the coronavirus pandemic. International students working in aged care, as nurses and in supermarkets have had the amount of hours they can work extended to support critical sectors. New Zealanders who are on 444 visas and arrived before 26 February 2001 will have access to welfare payments and the jobkeeper payment. Temporary skilled visa holders who have been stood down, but not laid off, will maintain their visa validity and businesses will have the opportunity to extend their visa as per normal arrangements. They will also be able to access up to $10,000 superannuation this financial year.\nIn other changes, working holiday makers who work in agriculture or food processing will be exempt from the six-month work limitation with the one employer and eligible for a further visa to keep working in these critical sectors and Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme workers can extend their stay for up to 12 months to work for approved employers.\nAustralia\u2019s national science agency CSIRO says zoonotic diseases \u2013 diseases which pass from animals to humans such as Covid-19 and Sars \u2013 now account for almost 75% of human infectious diseases. This morning it announced $220m would be directed to upgrading its containment biosecurity research facility in Geelong, which is currently testing vaccines to combat Covid-19. The facility\u2019s rapid work on the disease has also been supported by a further $10m in funding from the government.\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nFull Story podcast: when is it legal to leave your home?\nIs Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

        "content": "Ski towns and luxury retreats report rising number of cases amid concern hospitals could be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients\nResort towns favored by the rich and famous are facing a coronavirus crisis as the 1% have fled cities for their holiday hideaways.\nAs the rich have rushed to escape to their luxury retreats, local officials are reporting a disproportionate rise in Covid-19 cases and getting increasingly angry and worried about cases overwhelming small local hospitals.\nIn Ketchum, Idaho, the nearest city to the luxurious Sun Valley ski resort, Mayor Neil Bradshaw warned that the region was not the a place for a \u201cvirus vacation\u201d.\nIn last year\u2019s ski season, Sun Valley had 426,500 skier days. For decades, it has been a hotspot for jet-setting celebrities and billionaires including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Zuckerberg, Marilyn Monroe and Clint Eastwood. As of Thursday, there were 351 confirmed cases in its county, which is home to only 22,000 people.\n\u201cWe must discourage friends and visitors from coming to town,\u201d Bradshaw wrote in a column for the Idaho Mountain Express. \u201cFor a town used to welcoming visitors, that is hard to do, but we must reduce the number of people visiting our area.\u201d\nSun Valley is in Blaine county, which is now host to nearly half the statewide total of cases. The outbreak there has overwhelmed the region\u2019s only hospital, which has one ventilator and was partially shut down after several of its doctors were quarantined.\nWhat is happening in Idaho is reflective of a national trend. Rural counties with recreation economies show higher coronavirus infection rates, according to an analysis by the rural news site Daily Yonder, with rates that are more than three times higher than those of rural counties with other kinds of economies.\nAn analysis in the Salt Lake Tribune showed that these areas had some of the highest cases per capita in the country, rivaled only by New York City and New Orleans.\nThe two rural recreation counties with the most cases in late March were home to the popular ski resort spots Vail, Colorado. and Park City, Utah.\nA cluster of cases in Vail has now been tied to cases in Mexico, after 400 people, including business executives, took two chartered flights to visit the resort from Guadalajara. At least three high-profile executives tested positive after returning from Vail.\nIn Park City, home to the Utah\u2019s largest ski resort, city leaders urged people to stay away.\nThe town, which helps draw more than 4 million skiers to Utah each year, was the first place in Utah to see community spread of coronavirus and has had an especially high concentration of cases.\nPark City is in Summit county and its health director, Rich Bullough, said the first case in the county was a visitor and said the region\u2019s high rate of cases was \u201cabsolutely\u201d related to tourism.\nNew York City residents fleeing the coronavirus for upstate getaways and homes in the summer hotspots on Long Island are also angering residents. \u201cPut the National Guard right at the damn Hudson River or other points, nobody crosses that line,\u201d wrote one upstate New York commenter. \u201cThink about our families too, STAY DOWN THERE.\u201d\nThe Hamptons, the glitzy seaside New York community where Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow and a host of Wall Street bankers have summer homes, has seen its population surge in the wake of the pandemic. The village of Southampton has seen its population soar in recent weeks from 60,000 to 100,000.\nTourism spots in warmer climates have also seen coronavirus take a toll on the economy.\nPalm Beach county in Florida now has the highest death rate from Covid 19 in the state, 27 out of 144 deaths across the state so far. Palm Beach is home to Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Jimmy Buffett and Rod Stewart are among its famous residents.\nAlthough it is too early to say why the spikes in cases occurred, the increase in visitors is likely to be a factor.\nGovernor Ron DeSantis pinned the Florida cases on international visitors and initially planned to deploy Florida\u2019s resources there, before issuing a statewide stay-at-home order on Wednesday.\nIn Ketchum, Idaho, ER doctor Brent Russell said every day at work he used to see people traveling from Seattle, San Francisco and Washington DC.\n\u201cEvery week there\u2019s people from those places,\u201d Russell told the Idaho Statesman. \u201cMost likely someone from an urban area or multiple people from urban areas came here and they just set it off.\u201d",

        "content": "A number of American religious leaders have endangered their flock by holding services \u2013 and by claiming the virus can be defeated by faith in God\nLast Sunday in Tampa, Florida, the Pentecostal pastor and conspiracy theorist Rodney Howard-Browne conducted two services for full houses at his River church.\nThe closely packed audience spent hours together taking in hymns and Howard-Browne\u2019s extended sermon, even as the state implemented quarantine for New Yorkers, and projections estimated that Florida\u2019s coronavirus death toll would rise into the thousands.\nBut Howard-Browne is just one of the most prominent religious leaders on the Christian right who are endangering their flocks and the rest of America by claiming the virus is a hoax, or that it can only be defeated by supernatural means, rather than solid healthcare policy.\nA sometime guest on Infowars and at the White House; a multi-level marketing kingpin who has alleged that Hollywood celebrities sacrifice children and that New Zealand\u2019s Christchurch mosque attack was a so-called false flag event; Howard-Browne described Covid-19 as a \u201cphantom plague\u201d on 15 March.\nIn the same sermon, he claimed the public health response to the virus was part of a plot involving the Rockefeller Foundation and World Health Organization, whose goals were forced vaccinations and mass murder.\nHoward-Browne has repeatedly refused to call off services in the interests of social distancing. In fact, in recent weeks he has insisted that his congregants embrace and shake hands, exhorting them that they were \u201crevivalists, not pansies\u201d.\nOn Monday, he was finally arrested for violating Florida\u2019s rules on social distancing.\nThere are other American religious leaders and preachers who are in equally deep denial about the potentially deadly virus which will almost certainly infect a significant proportion of evangelicals, along with all other Americans.\nRoy Moore, a pastor, former Alabama supreme court judge and failed Trump-backed Alabama Senate candidate who lost amid allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, told Facebook followers he would write a letter to his fellow pastors on what he called their \u201cduty to continue church assemblies, even in the midst of these trying times\u201d.\nMoore added: \u201cOur faith requires it, our duty demands it, and no law or government can prohibit it.\u201d\nKenneth Copeland, a Texas-based \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d preacher who once defended his ownership of three private jets on the grounds that commercial flights would require him to \u201cget in a long tube with a bunch of demons\u201d, told viewers of his Victory Channel in early March that coronavirus was a \u201cweak\u201d strain of the flu, and that fearing the pandemic was a sin.\n\u201cFear is a spiritual force. Fear is not OK. It is sin. It is a magnet for sickness and disease \u2026 You are giving the devil a pathway to your body,\u201d Copeland said.\nHe also criticized pastors who had suspended in-person services and moved to online streaming.\nSelf-described prophet Lance Walnau wrote in a blogpost that \u201cthis virus will touch just a fraction of the population\u201d, adding that it was less dangerous than seasonal flu.\nHe turned to conspiracy theory for an explanation of the public health response and associated media coverage. \u201cThe left wants the economy distressed because crisis improves their chances of taking office,\u201d Walnau wrote.\nHe then counseled readers to ignore the information being published by media outlets.\n\u201cThere is a spirit on media that will exaggerate this virus so badly that you will need to insulate your head in order to keep yourself free from paranoia,\u201d Walnau wrote.\nIn the rightwing Catholic-aligned religious journal First Things, meanwhile, editor RR Reno castigated the widespread closure of Catholic churches and the suspension of public masses in Rome.\nReno wrote: \u201cIt is imperative that Christian leaders not succumb to the contagious panic, which is a weapon of the enemy to enslave us to our fears.\u201d\nFrom Montana, Chuck Baldwin \u2013 a pastor, former politician and purveyor of conspiracy theories about \u201cZionist influence\u201d in the media \u2013 left the question of whether the virus was a hoax open in an online sermon.\nBut he added: \u201cIf it\u2019s not a hoax, the virus is being used as a completely exaggerated, super-hyped, super-inflated psychological ops campaign against the American people \u2013 a coordinated full-court press of intimidation and fear-mongering by government, the mass media and the CDC.\u201d\nThat message was dutifully amplified by the Idaho state representative Heather Scott on her Facebook page.\nOthers on the Christian right acknowledge the reality of the virus, but proffer supernatural causes or remedies.\nIn a blogpost last week, Ralph Drollinger, who has led Bible study for Trump cabinet members, suggested the virus was an instrument of divine judgment, and appeared to blame LGBTQ people. Drollinger later claimed that this was a misinterpretation.\nAnother would-be prophet, Jeremiah Johnson, claimed last week to have had a prophetic dream in which God had spoken to him.\nIn a baseball stadium where Trump, at bat, outwitted a demonic pitcher, Johnson said God had told him: \u201cThe enemy has intended to strike out Donald Trump at a very critical hour in history. But behold, supernatural help is on the way, for I will slow down the advancement of the enemy and allow him to knock this out of the park.\u201d\nAndr\u00e9 Gagne, an associate professor of theological studies at Concordia University, and a researcher of the Christian right, recently published on the phenomenon of coronavirus denialism among evangelicals. Asked why evangelical leaders are committed to taking such a risk in denying the reality of the infection, or even assisting its spread, Gagne said it was rooted in their theology.\n\u201cMany of these preachers believe Christians shouldn\u2019t be controlled by a \u2018spirit of fear\u2019,\u201d Gagne said. \u201cThey often quote biblical texts which promise God\u2019s healing and protection to those who have faith. They are confident that God is in control; that this is part of his overall plan before a great end-times spiritual revival.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cThere are those who also understand this in terms of \u2018spiritual warfare\u2019, and that Jesus gave Christians authority over every demon and sickness. And if a Christian dies, no worries: he or she will \u2018be with the Lord\u2019.\u201d\nMeanwhile, even where they disagree about the virus, religious leaders have found common ground on one subject: the importance of fundraising.\nWhile Trump\u2019s spiritual adviser Paula White-Cain has now recommended social distancing to her audience, she and Kenneth Copeland both encouraged their listeners to keep the donations rolling into their churches.",

Three remain in hospital, in serious condition. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible,\u201d said one family member who attended the celebration and asked not to be named. \u201cNobody could have imagined the virus would strike with such devastating force.\u201d\nAfter lunch, several guests spent the afternoon at the \u201ccountry\u201d \u2013 sparking speculation they had caused its coronavirus cluster \u2013 something strenuously denied by one friend of Brazil\u2019s former monarchy. \u201cOne thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d they insisted. \u201cNobody knows what happened \u2013 who brought it [the virus] and who didn\u2019t. They were surprised by this.\u201d\nWhatever the truth, two days later on 9 March, coronavirus continued to contaminate the club\u2019s illustrious membership. At a packed assembly \u2013 reportedly convened to thrash out a dispute between its old guard and a new generation of associates who lack the traditional surnames of past members, but not their deep pockets \u2013 cross words, and then kisses and hugs were exchanged.\n\u201cLots of people lost their fortunes in the financial crisis \u2013 people who were stinking rich and ended up with nothing \u2013 so they had to sell their membership,\u201d one prominent Rio socialite said of the generational tug-of-war at the club where members are chosen by secret ballot and it costs around \u00a370,000 to join.\nThe 270-strong audience also included people who were at the imperial family\u2019s commemoration \u2013 further fueling suspicions they were to blame for the outbreak.\n\u201cIt was a tense meeting, big names in business were there,\u201d the high-society source said. \u201cSeveral people left the meeting infected.\u201d\nThe country club is not the only oasis of Brazilian prosperity and influence touched by coronavirus. A pop star, an actress and the daughter of a top government official were infected during a celebrity wedding at a beach resort that boasts of being \u201cconceived with the philosophy of exclusiveness\u201d. Some affluent guests had reportedly flown in from holidays in Europe and Aspen, Colorado.\nBrazil\u2019s presidential palace has also been hit, with more than 20 members of a delegation that flew to meet Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate testing positive for Covid-19. The president, Jair Bolsonaro, claims he tested negative but has refused to make those results public.\nThe connection between the spread of coronavirus and Brazil\u2019s super-rich has sparked discussion over their role in introducing the ailment to Brazil \u2013 and the gulf between rich and poor in one of the most unequal societies on earth.\nMany fear that while the first coronavirus wave has crashed over Brazil\u2019s largely white political and economic elite, it is the poor and mostly black masses who will eventually suffer the most \u2013 without the luxury of being able to self-isolate at home or resort to expensive private hospitals.\nOne of the first deaths recorded in Brazil was that of Cleonice Gon\u00e7alves, a 63-year-old domestic helper who was reportedly infected by her wealthy employer when she returned from holiday in Italy. \u201cIt goes without saying that the most vulnerable will always be the most affected, irrespective of whether there is a pandemic or not,\u201d the black feminist intellectual Djamila Ribeiro wrote in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper recently. \u201cThese are structural issues.\u201d\nOthers, including some country club members, wonder whether some of Brazil\u2019s mega-moneyed coronavirus patients exposed others to the illness by failing to properly isolate or quarantine themselves \u2013 perhaps believing their economic status meant they were above such mundane measures.\nOne Brazilian tycoon is reportedly being investigated by police for allegedly flying his private jet to the beach last month despite having tested positive for Covid-19. The man \u2013 an investment banker who denies the charges \u2013 is accused of infecting at least two locals in Trancoso, a glamorous seaside town in Bahia state.\nRio de Janeiro \u2013 which has so far suffered 1074 coronavirus cases and 47 deaths \u2013 has been in lockdown since late March, forcing a succession of high-society soir\u00e9es to be scrapped.\nAmong the aborted events was a bash for 1,000 people at the beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel to celebrate the marriage of Alexandre Birman, a multi-millionaire footwear designer who makes crocodile and snakeskin shoes for Hollywood stars.\nA confidant of the Orl\u00e9ans e Bragan\u00e7a family said they had more pressing concerns with two relatives still in intensive care. \u201cThey feel sad, apprehensive and worried \u2026 They are frightened with all this repercussion,\u201d they said.\nSome have pointed an accusing finger at Brazil\u2019s jet-setting elites for importing the illness after eye-wateringly expensive overseas adventures, with one left-wing website last week announcing: \u201cThe rich and famous have spread coronavirus around Brazil.\u201d\nAnother blog declared: \u201cThe rich have contaminated Brazil.\u201d\nBut a guest at the royal family\u2019s fateful lunch said it was wrong to scapegoat the wealthy for a sickness uninterested in social class. \u201cBoth poor and rich are dying all around the world,\u201d they said. \u201cPeople who travel more might have caught it first but the virus doesn\u2019t choose its victims. It can attack anyone.\u201d",

        "content": "As the coronavirus crisis deepens, the plight of people crossing the Mediterranean to escape conflict has been all but forgotten. A crew of German rescuers is intent on bucking that trend\nAfter a two-month break, the Alan Kurdi migrant rescue boat is heading back out into the central Mediterranean, as asylum seekers continue to attempt the desperate journey to reach Europe despite coronavirus fears.\nThe boat, operated by the German NGO Sea-Eye, left the Spanish port of Castell\u00f3n de la Plana on Tuesday and is expected to reach waters off the coast of Libya this weekend.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to put together a crew in this current crisis due to the spread of Covid-19,\u201d says Sea-Eye\u2019s mission manager, Jan Ribbeck. \u201cBut we are taking extra security precautions and have established an outbreak management plan.\n\u201cYou see, this pandemic will be over at some point. But migration will not, and asylum seekers will continue to risk their lives. We cannot turn away, especially at this time, when media attention is focused almost exclusively on other problems.\u201d\nAlan Kurdi, named after the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in 2015, is currently the only NGO rescue boat operating in the central Mediterranean. The coronavirus outbreak has forced many charities to concentrate their aid efforts in European countries affected.\nAccording to the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, almost 800 people departed from Libya in March. A total of 43 disembarked in Italy, in the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, while about 155 have landed in Malta. The rest were captured at sea by the Libyan coast guard and have been deported back to Libya.\n\u201cThe virus has landed in Europe and the spotlight on some phenomena seems to have gone out,\u201d says Matteo Villa, a research fellow from the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, a migration thinktank.\n\u201cBut the migrants never disappeared: thousands are stuck on the Greek islands, others on the border between Greece and Turkey. From countries like Tunisia and Algeria, people have postponed the trip for fear of coronavirus. But in Libya, the detention centres are scarier than the virus.\u201d\nThere have been few confirmed cases of coronavirus in Libya so far. But what will happen if the virus spreads among migrants?\n\u201cTesting for Covid-19 is currently centralised and limited,\u201d says Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR\u2019s special envoy for the central Mediterranean.\n\u201cTheoretically refugees and migrants in urban areas can access it, but we are not aware of any being actually tested. A case of an asylum seeker suspected of Covid-19 turned out to be negative. Many people displaced by the conflict are particularly fragile, as well as refugees and migrants who live in sub-standard shelter conditions. Those currently living in detention centres are already confronting the risk of TB and would be very vulnerable to coronavirus.\u201d\nThe UNHCR announced last week that it would suspend some activities in Libya and stop making visits to detention centres until staff are given personal protective equipment. Phone counselling and outreach to refugee community leaders will increase, said the agency.\n\u201cLibya is in the midst of worsening conflict, which has impacted healthcare and medical services \u2013 which already had limited financial resources \u2013 and [there are] often shortages of basic equipment and medicines,\u201d says Cochetel. \u201cRefugees/asylum seekers, as well migrants, also often struggle to access official medical centres, as they do not have legal documentation.\u201d\nWith the international community distracted by the coronavirus outbreak, fighting in Libya has intensified. Libyan armed factions have defied the UN\u2019s call for a \u201cglobal ceasefire\u201d and last week fighting escalated across the country, with forces loyal to eastern warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar claiming to have gained control of a string of towns in the north-west.\nAs always in conflicts, it is the most vulnerable who pay the biggest price. Thousands of migrants remain stuck in Libyan detention centres, where they are subjected to torture and abuse. According to the UNHCR, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on departures by sea from Libya is not yet clear. Certainly, given the absence of NGO rescue boats, attempting to reach Europe from North Africa has become increasingly risky in recent months.\nSince the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, many charities committed to saving migrants in the central Mediterranean have temporarily abandoned their activities at sea and transferred their resources, including doctors and other health workers, to European hospitals. Long attacked by the Italian government and affected by unjustified judicial investigations, teams from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms are providing support to the Italian health authorities.\nMSF staff are based in four hospitals in areas of the northern Italian province of Lodi, part of Lombardy, the country\u2019s worst-hit region. Even Open Arms doctors are now on the frontlines in Italian hospitals, including Bergamo. Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian NGO normally engaged in the rescue of migrants at sea, has launched a \u201ctelephone emergency room\u201d for psychological support in areas worst affected by Covid-19.\nWith the German NGO Sea-Watch waiting to return to sea \u2013 their boat is moored in Sicily \u2013 the only ship currently operating in the central Mediterranean is the Alan Kurdi.\n\u201cWe have set up booths for the isolation of any patients with symptoms of Covid-19 or tuberculosis,\u2019\u2019 says Ribbeck. \u201cWe cannot do the tests onboard because the swabs must be shipped to specialised centres. But we are prepared to face the emergency.\u201d\nThe most difficult task, however, will be finding a safe haven in Europe to take migrants rescued at sea. Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, said during a recent conference call to the EU\u2019s foreign affairs council that the country is unable to open its ports to migrants at the present time. \u201cIt\u2019s not about wanting to be good or bad,\u201d said Di Maio. \u201cItaly can\u2019t just do it now.\u201d\n\u201cWe respect the national fate of all European countries fighting against this pandemic and especially the situation facing Italy,\u201d says Ribbeck. \u201cNo state in the Mediterranean should be left alone on the question of reception of refugees in the coronavirus crisis. We will address our flag state if it should become necessary.\u201d",

        "content": "Lack of testing and failure to report on cases means scale of outbreak could be far greater than thought, doctors warn\nBrazil is bracing for a surge in coronavirus cases as doctors and researchers warn that underreporting and a lack of testing mean nobody knows the real scale of Covid-19\u2019s spread.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is enormous underreporting,\u201d said Isabella R\u00eallo, a doctor working in emergency and intensive care in Rio de Janeiro hospitals, in a widely shared Facebook post challenging official numbers. \u201cThere are MANY more,\u201d she wrote.\nAs Latin America\u2019s worst hit country, Brazil officially has 9,056 coronavirus cases \u2013 including actors, singers, government ministers and Fabio Wajngarten, press secretary of the president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nWith 14 million Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where basic sanitation is frequently lacking, informal workers are struggling from lost income during lockdown, and social isolation is challenging or impossible. The first case has already been reported in an Amazon indigenous community.\nBolsonaro called the pandemic a \u201clittle flu\u201d and insisted Brazilians would be immune because they were used to jumping in sewage. His government has distributed just 54,000 tests for a population of about 210 million. Last month the health ministry stopped releasing the numbers of suspected cases.\n\u201cIn Brazil that\u2019s certainly a critical issue, if not a crisis,\u201d said Albert Ko, department chair and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, noting that widespread testing helped Taiwan, South Korea and Germany blunt the epidemic\u2019s rise.\n\u201cIt is clear we have to improve the issue of tests, and improve a lot,\u201d health minister Luiz Mandetta told reporters this week.\nEstimates vary wildly. This week, Edmar Santos, health secretary for Rio de Janeiro, said the state could have 50 to 100 infected people for each of its 1,074 confirmed cases.\nBrazil\u2019s official toll of 359 deaths is just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Fernando Bozza, a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz who is modelling the pandemic. \u201cYou have a mountain of other deaths that are either directly or indirectly associated with the epidemic and they are not notified.\u201d\nR\u00eallo, who works in private and public hospitals in Rio, said test results can take up to seven days to arrive. She dealt with three deaths last week alone but results confirming coronavirus arrived after the patients had died \u2013 meaning they did not enter the count. The notification systems she deals with vary from handwritten forms to online ones.\n\u201cI\u2019m just one doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number I am seeing of critically ill patients, of what I see and what people I know tell me about, does not match the number being disclosed.\u201d\nShe and other doctors are worried about running short of personal protection equipment before the full force of the pandemic has hit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaotic, many cases arriving,\u201d said Rodolfo Espinoza, a doctor working in Rio\u2019s intensive care wards. \u201cWe know there are many suspected cases with no diagnosis.\u201d\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil\u2019s most populous with 44 million people and 4,048 cases, the government laboratory handling tests has a backlog of 16,000, state health secretary Jos\u00e9 Germann said on Wednesday.\nAt the Em\u00edlio Ribas public hospital in the state capital, tests are taking up to 15 days to come back, said Ana Ribeiro, its epidemiological service coordinator. The hospital \u2013 one of Brazil\u2019s most respected infectious disease institutions \u2013 is currently waiting for 134 test results, including those of three who have died.\n\u201cThere are many people getting symptoms and they cannot handle it,\u201d Ribeiro said.\nCemeteries in S\u00e3o Paulo are burying 30 to 40 people a day with coronavirus symptoms but, in most cases, no test result, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper reported.\nThe non-profit group Viva Rio runs six health centres, called UPAs, in Rio de Janeiro, all near favelas and all almost exclusively dealing with respiratory cases.\n\u201cPeople are not going to UPAS for other reasons,\u201d said general coordinator Jos\u00e9 Pacheco. \u201cI just select the most vulnerable or most serious to test; the vast majority are not tested.\u201d\nS\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, the second biggest city in Rio state, has 10 confirmed cases. Resident Fab\u00edola Lima, a financial specialist, believes there are many more.\nShe lives with her three sisters, all of whom went to private hospitals after suffering classic coronavirus symptoms like fever, headaches and dry coughs. They were told tests were not available, and sent home. They too were not included in the official tally.\n\u201cThis number being released is totally unreal. This makes people think everything\u2019s normal,\u201d Lima said, while her sister Christiane, coughed incessantly in the background.\nDespite outbreaks of Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever in recent years, the past three Brazilian governments slashed funding for science and technology, said Rodrigo Brindeiro, a molecular biologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who helped design the test Fiocruz uses.\nBrazil is now competing in international markets to buy the test ingredients it needs.\n\u201cOur failure was long-term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that if the diagnosis does not improve rapidly there will be a lot of underreporting in these favelas of Rio and this is extremely worrying.\u201d\nIn an email, the health ministry said 40,000 more molecular tests were being delivered this week and another 15 million \u201care being acquired\u201d. It has taken delivery of half a million antibody tests donated by mining giant Vale, which is expected to deliver millions more. Mandetta said the antibody tests have \u201cvarious degrees of sensitivity\u201d. Health ministry documents sent to states and towns said the tests were probably just 25% accurate in diagnosing negative cases.\nThese antibody tests will only spot people carrying coronavirus four to seven days after they become infected, said Brindeiro.\nAs Brazilians chafed under lockdown and largely ignored Bolsonaro\u2019s demands to get back to work, there are signs that many people also sought reliable information instead of his anti-science, anti-media, populist posturing. Brazil\u2019s biggest newspaper, the Folha de S Paulo \u2013 which Bolsonaro has described as \u201cgarbage\u201d \u2013 reported a record 70 million readers in March.\nAn interview with biologist Atila Iamarino Iamarino on the TV show Roda Viva this week drew its biggest audience since Bolsanaro himself appeared in 2018, and has been viewed 3 million times on YouTube.\nConcerns over the lack of testing were voiced.\n\u201cYou have the tests, which are the flashlight you can point in any direction and know what\u2019s happening there,\u201d said Iamarino. \u201cWithout this flashlight, what you can use is a candle.\u201d",

She\u2019s 99 so obviously she\u2019s frail \u2013 I didn\u2019t think there was any way she would recover from it. But she seems to have done it.\u201d\nHe jokingly added: \u201cI don\u2019t know how she got through it. I don\u2019t think she has ever eaten a vegetable or fruit. She lives on marmalade sandwiches and biscuits. But she\u2019s never smoked or really drank.\u201d\nReynolds was a driver during the second world war, and aged 21 she survived a bomb that landed outside her home in Liverpool by hiding under the table, after refusing to get in the air raid shelter because she wanted to read her book.\nShe\u2019s now looking forward to turning 100 in July.\nWheelie nice gestures\nAround the country, residents have been leaving gifts and messages on their wheelie bins to support the key workers collecting their rubbish each week.\nRefuse collectors in Hounslow, west London, were even treated to a bottle of champagne on their round, along with dozens of morale-boosting notes.\n\u201cThank you so much for working on the \u2018frontline\u2019!

It\u2019s something that we all overlook, but everybody at the moment is making very good use of their streaming systems.\u201d\nWith its two charity shops closed due to the coronavirus lockdown, BSWA had little other means of raising the funds needed, and Fawcett said they were overjoyed to have received the money so quickly.\n\u201cIt just shows that when given the opportunity to help out, people really do dig in and think of others,\u201d she said.\n600% boom in online library memberships\nThere has been a 600% rise in online library membership in some areas of the country, as people turn to e-books and audio books in the coronavirus lockdown.\nHampshire county council has had a 770% increase in new digital users, Cornwall council a 630% increase and Hertfordshire county council an increase of 332%, the Local Government Association (LGA) revealed.\nCouncils have been working to provide additional online resources, using the hashtag #LibrariesFromHome to promote their services.\nAs libraries are restricted in the number of e-books and audio books they can provide due to costs and licensing limits, the LGA is calling on the government and publishers to work together to unlock an additional \u00a35m to enable libraries to increase their capacity.\nCllr Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the chair of the LGA\u2019s culture, tourism and sport board, said: \u201cCouncil libraries provide a vital service for residents and act as community hubs in normal times. Their online digital contribution has now become equally important as people turn to them as a way to help pass the time at home.\n\u201cExtra funding would help libraries extend their licences and meet this growing demand.\u201d",

        "content": "An expert guide on what kinds of precautions older people \u2013 and those around them \u2013 must take amid the coronavirus pandemic\nPeople 60 and older are at far higher risk of getting very sick or dying from the coronavirus. And people 85 and over are even more vulnerable, with a death rate from the virus between 10% and 27%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nDr Mary Tinetti, chief of geriatrics at Yale school of medicine and Yale New Haven hospital, explains what kinds of precautions they \u2013 and the people around them \u2013 must take.\nThere really isn\u2019t a right answer to your question. It is between a rock and a hard place. Is it better for people to go out in public and get their groceries or to have them delivered? If they\u2019re in a place where the grocery store delivers then they should have it delivered. The ideal would probably be a single family member who picks up the groceries at a place that is safe and delivers it, perhaps cleaning off the containers.\nMany people don\u2019t have that option. In that case, they need to rely on volunteer corps. The volunteer should be carefully screened and have daily checks to make sure they are well. And reminded to wash their hands before touching anything.\nThe data that we have now suggests that the risk of getting much sicker with the Covid is 60 and older. But it\u2019s even people in their 40s and 50s if they have serious chronic conditions such as lung disease or heart failure.\nIt is such a big trade-off because interacting and being socially engaged is so important to get through this difficult time. But we know from what\u2019s happened in other countries already that the best prevention is the more you social-distance and keep away.\nThere are exceptions, obviously. If a person is very frail and you\u2019re worried they\u2019re not going to live for a long time, then obviously there should be visiting, there should be interaction.\nI think we\u2019re probably going to find that for every one person who has symptoms, there\u2019s probably [many more] people who have the infection, who don\u2019t have symptoms. And they are the ones that are infecting everybody else.\nIt\u2019s important to know where the behavior was coming from. And so I\u2019ve asked them: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing this?\u201d And if they say: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a real problem. I think they\u2019re overblowing it,\u201d I think you can reiterate what we\u2019ve known from other countries is that it\u2019s, again, people in their 50s with illnesses and people 60 and older who seem to get it the worst.\nThe other thing I\u2019m hearing from older people if they want to stay connected to younger people is, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve gotta die of something.\u201d My answer to that is, \u201cYes, we all have to die from something.\u201d But the important thing to know here is when older people like yourself do get sick, you may not die right away. It could linger for a long time and be very uncomfortable for you. And it\u2019s taking up the use of things like ventilators and intensive care beds to take care of you because you didn\u2019t comply \u2026 at the expense of what could be one of your young relatives.\nWash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. It\u2019s clear that hand-washing and social distance are the two biggest things to do. Wash your hands before you go in the door. Wash the doorknobs as you\u2019re going in and out. Wash the package before you put it down. Lysol it or Clorox it. And if you\u2019re in their living space, stay 6ft away.\nWe love simple messages, and unfortunately Covid-19 didn\u2019t get the message that it was supposed to be simple.\nYoung people and older people get Covid. Young people and older people with Covid do get sick and require hospitalization, so it\u2019s a disease of all ages. That being said, most of the younger adults that are sick enough to be in the hospital [or need intensive care] \u2026 are likely to recover.",

The city\u2019s infrastructure is a disaster; its apartments are famously tiny; everything is overpriced; there are too many people in too small a space; and the whole city will one day have to reckon with the ravages of an encroaching sea.\nTop: A construction worker in the financial district of New York City. Bottom left: New York stock exchange. Bottom right: A commuter talks on the phone while walking through the Fulton Street metro station.\nYet New York has grown from a tiny New World trading post to a muscular global metropolis whose very name evokes dynamism and fierce, unruly vitality. It has survived booms, busts, world wars, the threat of cold war nuclear annihilation, 9/11, gentrification and more, and thrived. The city swallows people of every nation and language and spits out New Yorkers; it generates vast fortunes; and it is responsible for a dazzling expression of art, literature, music and intellectual life. By comparison many other world capitals feel like sleepy museum exhibitions.\nTop: Grand Central Station at 3pm in Manhattan, New York. Bottom: A doorman in New York City.\nNow, however, this city of eight million people has met its match: a deadly virus, invisible to the human eye and ruthlessly efficient. Covid-19 has stretched New York\u2019s health infrastructure to breaking point. Every day cases, and deaths, mount. A military hospital ship is docked, imposingly, in New York harbor. There are field hospitals in Central Park. Millions of New Yorkers have shut themselves into their homes.\nThis is a city under quarantine. \u201cNo longer were there individual destinies,\u201d Albert Camus writes in The Plague: \u201cOnly a collective destiny, made of plague and emotions shared by all.\u201d\nTop left: An EMT at Bellevue hospital center in Manhattan. Top right: A member of the press takes video of the temporary morgue at Bellevue hospital. Bottom left: Creative face masks in midtown. Bottom right: Used vinyl gloves and a dead pigeon on the streets of Manhattan.\nThe photographer Jordan Gale ventured out to capture this strange new world.\nIn Woody Allen\u2019s film Manhattan, the narrator found it impossible to look at the city without feeling that it \u201cpulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin\u201d \u2013 the jazzy, life-affirming exuberance of Rhapsody in Blue. Yet New York, now, is eerily quiet.\n\u201cAny noise you hear is startling,\u201d Gale said. He was walking down a street in SoHo when he realized that the only sound was a clip on his camera bag, clacking as he walked.\nTop left: Empty streets outside Central Park. Top right: Empty park seats at Bryant Park in Manhattan. Bottom: The Brooklyn Bridge deserted at 4pm.\n\u201cThe city is a vacant lot,\u201d he said. \u201cRoads are empty. Sidewalks are empty. Stores are boarded up. The owners clearly believe looting could start any minute.\u201d\nIn residential areas occasional people can still be seen in the street; they are making expeditions to the grocery store or bodega or taking the daily walks which increasingly feel like a minimum mental health requirement. The commercial areas of New York, on the other hand, are ghost towns.\nTop: A lone person along the streets in the Bronx. Middle: Gloves and surgical masks line the curb outside a Covid-19 testing facility at the Brooklyn medical center. Bottom: An empty subway car.\nTimes Square, a crowded intersection most New Yorkers gladly cede to tourists, has been abandoned by both. \u201cYou can take a photo down 42nd Street and there\u2019s not a single person, a single car,\u201d Gale said. \u201cThe only people you see are other photographers.\u201d\nThe more iconic the landmark, the more empty and unsettling. Grand Central Station looks like a \u201ctomb\u201d, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s eerie. To take a photo of Grand Central like that, normally, you\u2019d need some kind of special clearance \u2013 you\u2019d need to shut down the whole place.\u201d\nTop left: A bench outside an apartment complex in Queens. Top right: A flower arrangement in a window at the same complex in Queens. Bottom: Flushing Meadows Park in Queens.\nMany parts of the city, he noted, look cleaner than they have been in years, thanks to diligent scrubbing and disinfecting. The ground, however, is littered with blue vinyl gloves and broken surgical masks.\nWhen New Yorkers come out to scout for provisions their faces are concealed with whatever they can find \u2013 surgical masks; scarves; painters\u2019 masks; bandannas draped across their faces like outlaws in the old west. As they pass in the street, they keep a wary distance; if they acknowledge each other it is with terse, silent nods.\nLeft: A customer leaves Family Dollar in the Bronx. Right: Empty shelves at the Family Dollar.\nWhen people do talk, all conversations in some way concern the coronavirus. The rest of America tends to regard New Yorkers as liberal, unflappable, even heedless; but these days New Yorkers sound like rightwing survivalists. They speak of stockpiles, shortages, contingencies, plans.\nEveryone knows someone who has lost their income to coronavirus, or been hospitalized. Everyone wonders when the present predicament will \u201cend\u201d \u2013 but, of course, no one knows, and for New Yorkers, like people the world over, that may be the hardest part of all.\nCherry blossoms at an empty park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.",

        "content": "Starmer beats Long-Bailey and Nandy to replace Corbyn, with Angela Rayner to be his deputy\nSir Keir Starmer has won the Labour leadership election with more than 56% of the vote, bringing an end to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s tenure of almost five years at the top of the party.\nStarmer, a former director of public prosecutions, won in the first round as the top choice of members, affiliates and registered supporters, with 490,731 votes cast overall. His nearest rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey, got 28% of the vote, and Lisa Nandy 16% in the final leg of the race.\nAngela Rayner was elected deputy leader in the third round on 53%, with the doctor Rosena Allin-Khan in surprise second place on 26% and Richard Burgon on 21%.\nStarmer\u2019s immediate priority will be to respond to Boris Johnson\u2019s call for all party leaders to work together to tackle the coronavirus crisis.\nSpeaking after the result, Starmer said he would work constructively with the government and that his victory had come \u201cat a moment like none other in our lifetime\u201d as normal life had been brought to a halt.\nHe also said he was aware of the scale of the task ahead of him, with the Conservatives enjoying near-record support.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just lost four elections in a row. We\u2019re failing in our historic purpose,\u201d he said in a video message. \u201cBe in no doubt I understand the scale of the task, the gravity of the position that we\u2019re in.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a mountain to climb, but we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities and voters, to establish a coalition across our towns and our cities and our regions with all creeds and communities to speak for the whole of the country.\n\u201cWhere that requires change, we will change. Where that requires us to rethink, we will rethink.\u201d\nStarmer\u2019s victory marks the end of the Corbyn era, during which the party took a sharp turn to the left. The Corbynite left of the party had backed Long-Bailey for leader and Burgon for deputy, but neither came close to challenging the eventual winners, indicating appetite among the membership and supporters for a change of direction following Labour\u2019s election defeat in December.\nThe former shadow Brexit secretary is consideredsofter-left than Corbyn, but he has promised the former leader\u2019s supporters not to steer too far away from his predecessor\u2019s radical policy programme of nationalisation and fighting austerity.\nThe MP for Holborn and St Pancras will now start to put together a shadow cabinet and a team of advisers that is expected to draw from all wings of the party in an effort to draw a line under the factionalism that has dogged Labour in recent years. He has suggested he will give shadow cabinet roles to Long-Bailey and Nandy.\nStarmer, who was instrumental in the party\u2019s pro-second referendum position, will find his time dominated not by Brexit, but how Labour should respond as an opposition to the coronavirus crisis and its impact.\nJust before the announcement of the result, the prime minister wrote to all opposition leaders saying: \u201cAs party leaders, we have a duty to work together at this time of national emergency. Therefore, I would like to invite all opposition leaders to a briefing with myself, the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser next week.\u201d\nIn his acceptance statement, Starmer said Labour would \u201cengage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d during the crisis. \u201cNot scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\u201cBut we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we\u2019ll challenge that and call that out.\u201d\nRayner said it would be a \u201clong and difficult road ahead but we must unite, both in the face of this crisis and to offer the better future that the citizens of our country deserve\u201d.\n\u201cThings have dramatically changed in our country in recent months but our values remain the same, and more important than ever,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThose are the values we will reflect in our actions as an opposition and a movement \u2013 standing up for our public services, for our workers and carers, and for a society in which people work together and look after one another.\u201d\nStarmer and Rayner were congratulated by a wide range of trade unions and affiliated groups, including former Corbyn supporters.\nUnite, which had backed Long-Bailey and is Labour\u2019s biggest donor, highlighted their pledges to \u201cbuild upon our party\u2019s radicalism\u201d.\nLen McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said: \u201cIt is the job now of our movement to support them in this as they move forward to ensure our party plays its full part in our national political life in these unprecedented times.\u201d\nMomentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, released a statement signalling its intent to hold Starmer to account in terms of keeping support for public ownership of national services, a green new deal, scrapping tuition fees, closing immigration detention centres and taxing the top 5% of earners.\n\u201cHis mandate is to build on Jeremy\u2019s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\u201cIn this new era Momentum will play a new role. We\u2019ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the green new deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.\u201d",

Their wage bill of \u00a387m represents 63% of turnover and is among the lowest in the Premier League.\nIn an unusual move aimed at being \u201ctransparent with supporters, staff and stakeholders\u201d, however, Burnley have issued a statement detailing their predicted shortfall from the ongoing suspension of all football activities in England. The Premier League confirmed on Friday that the 2019-20 season \u201cwill only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so\u201d and will only be resumed with the full support of the government. Burnley\u2019s estimated losses of \u00a350m, it believes, are half of what other Premier League clubs stand to lose this season.\n\u201cBurnley FC are set to lose around \u00a35m in lost revenue from the remaining home games which in the event that the season finishes would be unlikely to be recouped owing to the likely prospect of these fixtures being played behind closed doors,\u201d the club said.\n\u201cIn addition, the Clarets face missing out on cash payments from the Premier League of up to \u00a345m in broadcasting revenue and other items if the season is not finished. It is believed that other clubs could be looking at up to a \u00a3100m shortfall.\u201d\nA week ago Mike Garlick, the Burnley chairman, spoke of maintaining the club\u2019s financial sustainability \u201cfor generations to come\u201d when announcing its latest set of healthy accounts for 2018-19. But on Saturday he warned: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely unprecedented situation that we and other Premier League clubs face and which we could not have foreseen in any way only just a few weeks ago.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now not just about Burnley or any other individual club anymore, it\u2019s about the whole football ecosystem from the Premier League downwards and all the other businesses and communities that feed from that ecosystem. As a club, as fans, as staff members and as a town we are all in this together and I\u2019m sure we can get through this by sticking together and helping each other in every way possible in these tough times.\u201d\nDemand for Burnley\u2019s foodbank service has quadrupled over the past two weeks, the club has also announced.",

It has also placed 3,241 people in quarantine.\nThe pandemic is yet to gather pace in Venezuela, where 153 confirmed cases have been reported. With only 73 intensive care beds in the country and an economy reeling from an economic crisis and years of sanctions, the country is perhaps the least able to cope with the situation.\nOnly a quarter of Venezuela\u2019s doctors have access to a reliable supply of water and two-thirds are without soap, gloves or masks, according to a survey by a local medical NGO last month.\nBorrell\u2019s statement called for international solidarity. \u201cNow is the time to devote all our energy and resources to fight the world\u2019s common challenge, the coronavirus,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is time to focus on global health. Only together can we protect the most vulnerable people in our societies, both medically and economically, from this virus and the human suffering that it brings.\u201d",

In broad terms are we going to continue to harm children to protect vulnerable people, or not?\u201d\nMedley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, reportedly told the Times that Britain must consider allowing people to catch the virus in the least deadly way possible.\nHis modelling showed that reopening schools and allowing people to return to work would let the pandemic take off again and that no way of easing the lockdown while controlling the virus had yet been found.\nHe also noted the effect of lockdown measures on people\u2019s income and mental health, children\u2019s education and levels of domestic violence, child abuse and food poverty.\n\u201cIf we carry on with lockdown it buys us more time, we can get more thought put into it, but it doesn\u2019t resolve anything. It\u2019s a placeholder,\u201d he said.\nNeil Ferguson, a leading professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said on Saturday that Britain would not be able to relax its stringent lockdown rules until May.\n\u201cWe want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May that we\u2019re able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now,\u201d he told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\u201cThere is a great deal of work under way to look at how we can substitute some of the very intense social distancing currently in place with a regime more based on intensive testing, very rapid access to testing, contact tracing of contacts. But in order to substitute that regime for what we\u2019re doing now, we need to get case numbers down.\u201d\nAcross the country, council and police forces have echoed the government\u2019s message to stay home this weekend. \u201cWe are urging the public to protect the vulnerable and support the NHS this weekend as the predicted hot weather may tempt people out,\u201d tweeted Lincolnshire Police, alongside photos of officers standing along the Skegness beachfront holding signs saying \u201cwe are closed\u201d.\nWe are urging the public to protect the vulnerable and support the NHS this weekend as the predicted hot weather may tempt people out. To anyone thinking of heading to the beach, the coast is CLOSED. Follow Government instructions on what you need to do. https://t.co/3MfYsJ3gSN pic.twitter.com/0GtGEYlrOD\nIt comes a fortnight after thousands of people were reported to have flocked to the town, in defiance of physical distancing rules, provoking an outcry from councillors and residents.\nIn London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Park, scores of cyclists reportedly ignored advice against congregating as they rode their bikes in close formation.\nIt came after four of London\u2019s biggest parks penned an open letter to the public on Friday urging they behave responsibly, in order for authorities to keep the parks open.\n\u201cAs some parks have had to take the difficult decision to close down it is essential, that we we all work together in making sure we can keep as much open as possible,\u201d the letter reads.\nIn Cornwall, the local authority has urged hotels and letting agents to adhere to the government\u2019s Covid-19 closure orders ahead of the Easter holidays.\nThe government has put Britain into a widespread lockdown, closing pubs, restaurants and nearly all shops. It has also banned social gatherings and ordered people to stay at home unless it is absolutely essential to go out.\nBritain\u2019s death toll from the global pandemic rose to 3,605 on Friday, among 38,168 people who have tested positive for Covid-19.",

He was sprightly to a degree beyond his 70 years but, in any case, instinct had overtaken him. As the full-time whistle blew, and as Bosnia-Herzegovina began to absorb the scale of their achievement, he had vaulted a barrier at the front of this creaking Soviet-era stand\u2019s top tier and wiped away tears before surveying the scene below. \u201cHajmo Bosno!\u201d (\u201cGo, Bosnia!\u201d), he shouted through the misty air of an evening that would have seemed unremittingly bleak if something this momentous had not just occurred. \u201cWe did it!\u201d\nI had travelled with Abdulah on one of a vast convoy of coaches from Sarajevo to the Lithuanian city Kaunas. The idea was to take the same 1,125-mile journey as many of the thousands who had dropped everything in anticipation of what lay at its end. If Bosnia won in Lithuania they would qualify for their first World Cup and, for a young country still recovering from the war of the early 1990s, the meaning of that achievement almost transcended explanation.\nBut because football is about people and lives, and the stories that bind and explain both, there was no lack of willingness to seek the words. Abdulah had left Bosnia in 1968 to become an iron worker in Adelaide. When Brazil 2014 began to seem a realistic proposition, he saved up and took three flights to Sarajevo for a six-week visit that would overlap with Bosnia\u2019s final four games. Being on this journey to Kaunas had lifted his soul, he said. He felt united with long-distant countrymen in a way that had never seemed possible.\nAs the bus hugged the Bosna river before winding through Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the forests of southern Lithuania, fuelled by rakia and laughter, the individual tales kept coming. Elvir had sold a home to fund his odyssey through the team\u2019s qualifiers, and hopefully to Brazil; Adnan was a qualified lawyer but had worked all hours in a hardware store to fund his ticket; Sabina was a disillusioned student with dreams of someday, somehow emigrating to Japan and would find a way of repaying her football-mad cousin for this week of escapism; Michael was a German soldier, posted to Sarajevo as part of Nato and the UN\u2019s post-war presence who could not bring himself to leave.\nIt was a rag-tag crew, with shared sadnesses and deeply personal ones, too; all joined in the expectation of a happiness whose vessel, a brilliant football team, they could never have foreseen. We arrived in Kaunas and so, it seemed, did the entire Bosnian diaspora. Laisves Aleja, the main street, played host to reunions of impossible poignancy. Cousins separated by war and then by oceans melted into each other\u2019s arms. Childhood friends from Sarajevo or Mostar picked each other out in a crowd and retold stories that had gathered dust. And now they would go to the football together.\nIt was a horrible game until the 68th minute. Safet Susic had composed a mesmerising attacking side propelled by Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic but little was coming off against a turgid Lithuania and the unthinkable looked increasingly real. Then Vedad Ibisevic found space in the box and jabbed into the net from six yards; the Bosnians who had filled this unappealing little stadium could now turn it into the venue for a party they would remember forever \u2013 and one I will too.\nI woke the next morning with, for reasons that had faded into an endless night, Abdulah\u2019s \u201cBosnia Adelaide\u201d flag by my side. He had long departed on the return leg to Sarajevo; I was to fly back to London from Kaunas. Soon after arriving home I posted it to his home address and, a couple of months later, received a note in reply: \u201cLook forward to seeing you again in Sao Paolo, Brazil.\u201d I did not make it there, but I have no doubt Abdulah did; for him, and all the others, there would be no barrier high enough to stop them following the country they adored.",

        "content": "Businesses from transport to steel warn they could go under unless government does more\nEvery sector of the British economy is suffering and asking the government to do more. Such is the scale of the economic hit that the country is facing from the coronavirus pandemic that even the widening of the government\u2019s bailout last week has failed to assuage business leaders\u2019 concerns.\nThe travel industry is seeking a relaxation of consumer protection rules, charities say they face a \u00a34bn shortfall amid rocketing demand for their services, and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic says it needs a multi-million pound rescue package. Even in normal times such requests would pose a quandary for governments. But now they are flooding in at once.\nAgainst this backdrop, the chancellor was forced to update the government\u2019s rescue plan last week. Sunak said he would prevent banks from requesting personal guarantees for emergency loans to small businesses and would extend the reach of his \u00a3330bn coronavirus business interruption loan scheme \u2013 under which the government offers interest-free 12-month loans.\nLarger firms not currently eligible for loans \u2013 the so-called \u201csqueezed middle\u201d of this crisis who were too big for the small-firms schemes but not large enough for the major bailout loans \u2013 would benefit from a new scheme under which the government would provide a guarantee of 80% so that banks could make loans of up to \u00a325m to firms with an annual turnover of between \u00a345m and \u00a3500m.\nBusiness lobby groups backed the upgrades to the rescue plan, albeit with a warning that the small print should not prove a barrier to firms accessing vital funds. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe announcement of a new loan scheme for mid-sized companies closes a significant gap in existing support.\u201d\nHowever, for some sectors it is not just a question of accessible finance. Travel firms said the difference between staying afloat and going bust could be changes to regulations as much as access to credit.\nMarc Vincent, the finance director of Newmarket Holidays, said the UK needs to follow the example of other EU governments, which have overturned consumer protection rules requiring travel firms to pay customer refunds within 14 days.\nVincent said a switch to credit notes, which can be used to buy a holiday at a later date or redeemed for cash after two years, would protect hundreds of travel firms that have usually paid in advance for airline tickets and hotels that are also in lockdown.\nTravel firms are among many industries that have temporarily ceased their main operations, but have incurred higher costs in other areas after keeping staff working to answer customer calls or provide other services. It means they can only use the government\u2019s furlough scheme \u2013 which pays 80% of staff salaries up to a cap of about \u00a325,000 to workers sent home \u2013 to subsidise the cost of some staff while others remain active on the company payroll.\n\u201cWhile a pub will close down and furlough everyone, we need extra people to handle cases, which in many cases are complicated and take longer to deal with,\u201d said Vincent.\nKristy Elsmere, joint managing director of the coach company Woods Travel Group, said a legal change allowing the use of credit notes would be an important reform, even though most of the company\u2019s regular customers were accepting vouchers or re-booking trips later in the year.\nReferring to one industry-specific bailout announced last week, she said: \u201cSome coach companies also run buses and have benefited from the new \u00a3400m bus rescue scheme, so they will have some cash coming in from that. But we don\u2019t, so we need the government to look at the package travel arrangements and allow credit notes to be given to customers.\u201d\nSunak agreed to cover the losses of bus companies in England over the next three months to ensure that services can still run.\nBus industry executives lobbied the government after ministers advised people against all non-essential travel, and passenger numbers \u201cfell off a cliff\u201d. A \u00a3167m fund will ensure that bus companies can cover their costs on essential services so that key employees, such as NHS staff, can get to work. The funding, which adds to an existing \u00a3200m bus subsidy scheme, follows similar agreements in Scotland and Wales.\nStagecoach, a key player in the industry, said on Friday that its local regional bus companies were currently seeing sales at about 15% of normal levels. The company, which will suspend it Megabus coaches between major towns and cities this weekend, said the new funding would mean \u201ckey workers can still get to and from work, and that communities can still access other services\u201d, such as shopping for food or picking up medicines.\nElsmere, who chairs the coach industry insurance scheme, said private coaches also provided vital services that would be missed if firms were allowed to go bust. Stately homes, hotels, schools and charitable events depend on groups travelling by coach. \u201cPeople think it is just for pleasure, but it underpins so many businesses.\u201d\nSunak and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, have argued the bus bailout was needed because firms such as Stagecoach provide vital infrastructure. A similar scheme to subsidise rail companies \u2013 effectively ending the franchise system as we know it \u2013 was justified on that basis.\nThis argument is not limited to bus, coach and rail companies. P&O Ferries has argued that it can be described as vital infrastructure. Last week it asked the government for a \u00a3150m bailout after passenger numbers dried up. The company, which is owned by the Dubai firm DP World, operates more than 30,000 voyages a year in Europe and accounts for about 15% of Britain\u2019s trade. It said income from its 8.4 million passengers a year normally subsidises its income from freight lorries, but the lockdown has plunged it into a \u00a3250,000 daily loss.\nVirgin Atlantic is also seeking a bailout, backed by lobbying from the aviation manufacturers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, who argue that Virgin is a major aircraft buyer and vital for the success of a key industry. Heathrow Airport, leader of another suffering sector, is also backing a Virgin bailout because the Branson-controlled airline is one of its main customers.\nRetail and steel, two sectors that were hurting even before the pandemic struck, are also desperate for help. The industry lobby group UK Steel told the Treasury the nation\u2019s steel companies were \u201cfast approaching a cashflow crisis\u201d.\nSir Phillip Green\u2019s Arcadia group is putting 14,500 staff on the government furlough scheme in a bid to prop up his crumbling retail empire. Meanwhile, the Horticultural Trades Association warned the government that the sector, which includes hundreds of garden centres, was facing losses of \u00a3687m by the end of June.\nEnergy companies, under pressure from cash-strapped households cancelling their monthly direct debt payments, have already asked the government to support a loan scheme worth up to \u00a3100m a month. Without the funds, the industry has warned it will struggle to offer payment holidays to businesses and households struggling to pay their energy bills.\nA spokesman for Energy UK, the industry lobby group, said; \u201cPeople are cancelling direct debits in increasing numbers. That\u2019s a problem for suppliers working on thin margins. It means there isn\u2019t the cushion needed to withstand an indefinite break by businesses and households in paying their bills.\u201d\nThe chancellor is expected to hold the line this week and resist what he sees as special pleading from multiple sectors \u2013 even if some exceptional cases such as rail and buses are getting through. He will say his revamped loan scheme will allow all employers to access the funds they need to cope over the next few months.\nSuccess will probably rest on how well the banks and other commercial lenders understand his new proposals and allow firms to access the new loans. Time is short for many companies and they will need funds fast.\nLast week Sunak admitted that of 130,000 inquiries to access loans, only 1,000 had been agreed. Businesses will cheer if the reformed bailouts expand the rate of loan agreements. If the new efforts don\u2019t work, those calls for sector-specific bailouts will get much louder.",

There have been 509 to date with total losses among those targeted of \u00a31.6m.\nAs many as 50 reports are being received daily, with 41 relating to a recent scam involving an email asking for donations to buy \u201cmedical preparations and supplies\u201d for the NHS to cope with coronavirus.\nOther scams purporting to be official messages from the government include texts telling people they have been fined \u00a3250 for leaving their home more than once during lockdown.\nThe number of coronavirus-themed phishing attempts stands at 2,192. These usually involve an email attempting to trick people into opening malicious attachments which could lead to criminals stealing their banking details, email logins and passwords.\nAn undisclosed number of the reports have been passed to police forces in areas where the culprits are thought to be based.\nCommander Karen Baxter, the national coordinator of economic crime at the City of London Police, said: \u201cCriminals will use any opportunity they can to take money from innocent people. This includes exploiting tragedies and global emergencies.\n\u201cAs more people stay indoors and work from computers and laptops at home, there is more opportunity for criminals to try and trick people into parting with their money at a time when they are anxious and uncertain about the future.\u201d\nPolice have issued fraud prevention advice against coronavirus-related scams and say more criminals will capitalise on public fears over the pandemic as it spreads.\nThe National Crime Agency, which released its annual threat assessment on Friday, said: \u201cWe continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on trends in serious and organised crime, including on fraud, cyber-attacks and other online activity, with the sudden surge in the amount of domestic internet use.\u201d\nAmong the myriad scams the NFIB analysed are fraudsters capitalising on the fact that bank branches are closed by encouraging people to switch accounts online.\nOthers are attempting to exploit the current economic downturn by contacting individuals who are out of work and offering them positions as key workers.\n\u201cPeople are obviously looking for jobs at the moment and criminals are using Covid-19 as a hook for employment, offering key worker positions as long as they pay an advance fee for vetting or background checks,\u201d said an Action Fraud spokesperson.\nThe majority of incidents reported so far relate to online shopping scams in which people have ordered and paid for personal protective face masks, hand sanitiser or testing kits which never arrive.\nThe first report of a UK scam relating to coronavirus was received on 9 February, and a further 20 were received by the end of the month.\nFinancial regulators recently warned savers about fraudsters seeking to exploit fears over the coronavirus outbreak.\nLast week the Pensions Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Money and Pensions Service issued a joint statement urging people not to make rash pension decisions as criminals try to exploit public concerns over the current market turmoil to dupe victims out of their cash.",

On Friday he said he would spend more time in isolation as he still had a temperature.\nShortly after his announcement, Symonds - who usually lives with the prime minister in the No 11 flat - shared a photograph of herself self-isolating in Camberwell, south London, with the couple\u2019s dog Dilyn.\nIn the Twitter post, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus.

There is also no data at the moment suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage for pregnant women.\nThe RCOG reiterates government advice that pregnant women \u201cshould pay particular attention to avoiding contact with people who are known to have Covid-19 or those who exhibit possible symptoms\u201d.\nIt adds: \u201cWomen above 28 weeks\u2019 gestation should be particularly attentive to social distancing and minimising contact with others.\u201d\nJohnson and Symonds, a former director of communications for the Conservative party, announced in February that they were engaged to be married and were expecting a baby.",

He said state and federal governments had not responded well to the crisis. \u201cThere\u2019s no coordination between even departments at the same level of government. The interaction of state and federal government is hostile.\u201d\nFinlay said while it was true the majority of coronavirus cases in Australia to date had come from returned travellers, a small number of returned travellers now being taken to hotels for enforced quarantine should be allowed to quarantine in their homes on compassionate grounds.\nFinlay said health workers could flag vulnerable people, such as the elderly or severely mentally unwell, with NSW Health for exemption from the enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels.\n\u201cUntil today the ministry of health had told me that everyone I\u2019d flagged as vulnerable was given their exemption,\u201d Finlay said on Saturday. \u201cToday I learned this was a lie. It hadn\u2019t actually been done.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all still in the hotel rooms. And it\u2019s worse than prison. They have cramped rooms with windows that don\u2019t open, no balcony and are not allowed to leave even for some fresh air and exercise. Some hotels aren\u2019t cleaning the rooms for the two weeks and aren\u2019t offering people products to clean their own bathrooms.\u201d\nFinlay said one person had been told they could have a food package delivered by a family member. The family member included a bottle of wine, which the hotel confiscated. He described those in the hotels as \u201cdetainees\u201d and said many did not have access to a laundry. One hotel, the Hilton, was charging some $20 to do the washing, he said. This is not covered by the government.\nOne of the vulnerable passengers Finlay flagged for medical exemption from staying in a hotel was a man who had survived being in a fifth floor hotel room in Kathmandu during the deadly Nepal earthquakes in 2015. He\u2019d been trapped for some time with dead bodies nearby.\n\u201cUnderstandably he didn\u2019t want to end up in a hotel with windows that didn\u2019t open, no balcony and no scope for getting out of the room to exercise and feel normal,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cHe held grave fears for his mental health and I agreed. I escalated his case a few times to the ministry of health with no communication back to me and no action taken.\u201d\nAnother vulnerable woman found out she was approximately 15 weeks pregnant. Due to being on a remote island prior to returning to Australia, she has so far had no antenatal screening and this is her first pregnancy. She had arranged to be seen by an obstetrician in her home city of Hobart but was unable to travel to Tasmania due to strict travel restrictions which meant that, even after completing two weeks isolation in NSW, she and her husband would be required to do the same again in Tasmania.\n\u201cShe works in an emergency service,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cShe was very anxious about not having any antenatal screening until the end of another four weeks. She reported to me that she spoke to the onsite doctor and that she is not allowed out of her room so she could get antenatal screening.\u201d\nFinlay also shared concerns for other quarantined arrivals, including a woman with a newborn baby who he said is a high risk for developing post natal depression, and an older couple where the husband has dementia.\n\u201cThey were to be isolated in a hotel despite having a home in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThe unfamiliar environment and confinement is likely to result in behavioural disturbances for her husband.\u201d\nHe said a paraplegic woman with a catheter and needing an air mattress so that she doesn\u2019t get pressure sores, and who has a carer who helps her with tasks such as bathing, was not allowed to be driven to Wollongong to her house that her friends had ensured was stocked with supplies for her return.\n\u201cTo my knowledge she is still languishing in a hotel in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience sit and wait for the authorities to rectify any of this because there\u2019s evidence that they know and still won\u2019t do anything. I\u2019d prefer to be in prison than turn a blind eye after days of trying through official channels to have all of this addressed.\u201d\nA remote and regional tropical emergency doctor, Amy Neilson, who was among the doctors placed into quarantine after returning from Peru, agreed with Finlay\u2019s assessment of the situation in hotels. Communications have been changing regularly particularly between police and the hotel, with lack of clarity given to those in isolation, she said, adding there was uncertainty on the date and time people will be allowed to return home. Neilson said people would cope better if they were given clear information.\n \u201cSome people really are struggling and lonely, particularly older people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disorientating for them.\u201d\n She added that \u201cpolice are running\u201d the hotel operations. \u201cThe communications between border force, police, the hotel and the army appear to be a mess,\u201d Neilson said.\nNSW police and the Hilton have been contacted for comment. In a statement, NSW Health confirmed The Public Health Order has provisions for exemptions. The department did not respond to questions around how many of these exemptions had been granted. The statement said the minister of health has delegated the authority to grant exemptions to a panel of experienced doctors.\n\u201cEach exemption request is individually considered, and a significant number of exemptions have already been granted,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cEach hotel has on site nursing and a daily medical presence. Travellers can access this medical service. Requests for exemptions are also escalated by this avenue. Applications for an exemption on medical or compassionate grounds can also be made by travellers to the Australian department of health, which sends these onto NSW Health.\u201d\nDo you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",

        "content": "Family and colleagues of Areema Nasreen recall an inspirational, professional and big-hearted member of her community and her hospital team\nAreema Nasreen spent her teenage years caring for her sick grandmother. The eldest daughter of parents from Mirpur, Pakistan, she grew up in Birmingham with four brothers and three sisters, and took huge comfort from looking after her nani amma \u2013 an experience that propelled her to keep on helping people.\nLast January, Nasreen fulfilled a lifelong ambition of graduating from university to become a fully qualified nurse at Walsall Manor Hospital. Last Friday, it was announced that Nasreen and fellow nurse Aimee O\u2019Rourke, both mothers of three children, had died, along with two healthcare assistants. The 36-year-old became the youngest NHS worker to die from Covid-19, leaving her family raw with grief.\nSpeaking to the Observer, Kazeema, 33, paid tribute to her sister\u2019s sacrifice. \u201cShe was a legend,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cEveryone remembers her with so much love and heartbreak because she had so much love to give. She was like a mum to us. She looked after us all.\u201d\nThe three sisters had spent five hours chatting at home before Nasreen went into intensive care two weeks ago. \u201cMe and her were like twins,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cWe got married on the same day, into the same family. We even had the same due date.\u201d\nKazeema and younger sister Ash, 32, had sat by her bedside at home. \u201cReema just wanted to sit and talk that day. She called mum in Pakistan and told her not to worry. She had to hold her breath really hard because the coughing was so bad. She just said to her: \u2018I\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t be upset otherwise I\u2019ll get upset\u2019. And then we took her to hospital.\u201d\nNasreen began her career at Walsall Manor Hospital in 2003 as a housekeeper, the year after she got married. She began nursing soon after and was a popular presence on the ward. One colleague, who didn\u2019t want to give her name, told the Observer: \u201cWe love her and miss her. She was an amazing nurse and so grateful for the privilege to do what we do. She always put her patients first and herself last.\u201d\nSpeaking to the Observer, relative Dr Samara Afzal said the family\u2019s heartbreaking loss was \u201cdeeply compounded\u201d by the severe, isolated restrictions of lockdown. \u201cNormally, hundreds of people would come to the house and be there to support family members,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with a pandemic, it\u2019s impossible and it\u2019s hard to know how someone is coping without being face to face.\u201d\nNasreen\u2019s elderly parents had initially been stranded in Pakistan by flight cancellations, unable to get home to Birmingham as their daughter was being put on a ventilator in intensive care. Nasreen\u2019s three children, aged from seven to 16 years, were not permitted to visit their mother in hospital. Her funeral was held last Friday, and attended only by immediate family members.\n\u201cThe [funeral procession] drove along our road and that was enough for us,\u201d said Kazeema. \u201cEveryone respected the distancing rule \u2013 Reema would have been really upset if we hadn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe younger sisters were taking care to comfort their niece and nephews. \u201cI was putting my nephew to bed and he asked if I was going to be his mum now and I just said, \u2018Of course, we\u2019ve always been your mums\u2019.\u201d Kazeema began to cry. She had followed in her sister\u2019s footsteps to work in Walsall Manor Hospital a few years ago. \u201cMe and my younger sister always supported Reema: we always looked after the kids and cooked for her and her husband when she was following her dream of going to uni. I don\u2019t know if I could live up to what she did. She was an angel.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cShe was so full of life and such a positive person to be around, always the life and soul at family gatherings and weddings. She was so dedicated to her job and her family, too. She was a fantastic role model and influence for Asian women.\u201d\nFormer patients of Nasreen, who was frequently described by colleagues as \u201cconfident and bubbly\u201d, paid tribute on a Facebook post by Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, remembering her as \u201cprofessional and kind\u201d, \u201ca fabulous nurse,\u201d \u201ca smiling hero\u201d.\n\u201cShe loved her work, her patients and her colleagues and she always had a smile,\u201d said nurse Fatima Parkar at Walsall Manor Hospital. \u201cI was very proud of her because, like me, she was a mature student. She worked, she studied and still looked after her family. It\u2019s not easy but she followed her passion.\u201d\nA fundraiser set up in Nasreen\u2019s memory last Friday raised over \u00a33,000 in less than 24 hours. \u201cAreema went out of her way with charity \u2013 she had a really big heart,\u201d said Afzal. \u201cThe money will be donated to causes she was close to, particularly helping poorer families.\u201d\nRichard Beeken, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare, told the Observer that staff had been hit especially hard by Nasreen\u2019s death. \u201cShe was an inspiration by virtue of what she achieved. To qualify as a clinical professional and be exemplary as she was\u2026 There is a local, community connection that will be felt far and wide.\u201d",

On Saturday he was confirmed as one of nine new members of basketball\u2019s hall of fame.

        "content": "Isolation fatigue could set in, particularly if period is extended beyond initial three weeks\nThe coronavirus lockdown could crumble as public frustration builds in the weeks ahead, a crime commissioner warned on Saturday night as police stepped up calls for people to stay at home during this weekend\u2019s sunny weather.\nThe Derbyshire police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, said \u201cisolation fatigue\u201d could set in and pose a genuine threat to the lockdown, especially after the likely decision to extend the measures beyond the current three-week period.\nDhindsa, whose force was criticised for \u201cnanny policing\u201d after using a drone to \u201clockdown shame\u201d Peak District hikers , said: \u201cIn this early phase of isolation, people\u2019s awareness is quite high, but the longer it goes on, people\u2019s frustration at not being able to do what they want to will grow. The real test will be in two or three weeks\u2019 time. How long can we keep a lockdown going?\u201d\nCountries that introduced stringent coronavirus measures sooner than the UK have been forced to increasingly tighten their approach. In France, where police have checked more than 3.7 million citizens to ascertain if they are complying with its lockdown, tens of thousands of extra officers and gendarmes are being deployed across the country this weekend to ensure coronavirus measures are obeyed.\nSome fear that Italy presents a warning of the social unrest that can build during a lengthy lockdown. More than three weeks in, reports of localised disorder have emerged, with tensions swelling across the poorer southern regions as people run out of food and money.\nThe Spanish government announced on Saturday that it would seek parliamentary approval to extend its near-total lockdown to 26 April. Police in the country said that they had arrested more than 1,100 people and fined nearly 90,000 since the measures began in mid-March.\nAs the UK\u2019s response faces its greatest challenge this weekend with the arrival of warmer weather and the start of the Easter school holidays, senior policing figures lined up to reissue pleas for people to avoid travel and stay at home. Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents 30,000 officers in the capital, said: \u201cPlease, please, please, park your backside on a sofa and don\u2019t get off it.\u201d\nMarsh said that the public should put themselves in the position of police and other emergency workers. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely frightening: everybody is being told to stay at home and stay two metres from others, but my colleagues can\u2019t \u2013 in order to enforce correctly. It\u2019s bonkers,\u201d he said.\nThe demand for the public to obey the lockdown was echoed by John Apter, the national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents officers outsde the capital. \u201cDuring the hot weather this weekend I ask the public to give us their support and to work with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we all work together, we can get through this. We can save lives and support our NHS. All I ask is that the public gives us their support in this time of crisis.\u201d\nThe stakes were raised last Friday when Professor Neil Ferguson, a leading scientist advising the government, warned that the infection rate in the UK could remain high for \u201cweeks and weeks\u201d if people flouted social distancing rules this weekend.\nMinisters have stressed that \u201cstay at home\u201d is an instruction, not a request. Their demands, however, arrive amid concern over whether all younger people, who are less likely to become seriously ill, will observe the strict rules.\nSome individuals, the Observer has been told, are flouting coronavirus measures by continuing to go on dates with new people \u2013 albeit in homes. In London, rule flouting by groups of young people has been partly blamed for the closure of green spaces such as Victoria Park in the east of the city.\nThis weekend, signs appeared at entrances to Hampstead Heath in north London urging visitors enticed by the sun to maintain a distance of two metres from others and not to take public transport or drive to the outdoor space.\nBrockwell Park in south London will be closed on Sunday because so many people had flouted the government\u2019s social distancing advice, Lambeth Council said.\nIt tweeted: \u201cDespite clear advice, over 3000 people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups. This is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the actions of a minority now means that, following police advice, Brockwell Park will be closed tomorrow. StayHome.\u201d\nElsewhere in the UK, police have been ordered to try to deter people from visiting coastal areas, national parks and other popular destinations. At Brighton station, officers were asking all arrivals to return home if they had journeyed to the seaside to enjoy the sun. Further west along the south coast, senior police figures said they had to trust the public to enforce the lockdown because they could not guard every beach and destination.\nChief constable Shaun Sawyer said Devon and Cornwall\u2019s 700 miles of coastline was \u201cunpoliceable other than by the public themselves\u201d. He added: \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll focus on core areas. We\u2019re certainly looking at the arterial roads into the south-west \u2013 the M4, M5, A303 and then, within the peninsula, the A30. But we have a very small workforce. Devon and Cornwall police requires the public both within and outside our geography to play their part.\u201d\nBoris Johnson announced the national lockdown on Monday 23 March, and said the government would review it within three weeks, which means a decision is likely to be announced in the next few days.\n\u201cI cannot imagine it not being extended beyond three weeks,\u201d said Dhindsa.",

        "content": "The latest series from Julian Fellowes starts badly and barely improves but it is a reminder football has never stood still\nYou can see how The English Game must have sounded in conception. It\u2019s the birth of football. It\u2019s toffs against proles, the rivalry of one of the great aristocrats of the early game, Lord Arthur Kinnaird, and the Glaswegian stonemason who was the first great professional, Fergus Suter. It\u2019s about an idea going out into the world and being profoundly changed when it is taken up by the masses.\nBut Netflix\u2019s new series comes nowhere near what it might have been, and is little more than a mishmash of Downton Abbey stereotypes and trouble-at-mill cliches. The toffs are habitually awful, the banks are always foreclosing, and the proles, salt-of-the-earth brawlers and charmers that they are, can\u2019t help themselves but get everybody unhelpfully pregnant.\nAnd the football? From the moment a minute in when Craig Parkinson, as the self-made mill-owner Walsh, tells Suter: \u201cI\u2019ve seen \u2019ow you play in Scotland. Your passing game is the future of football,\u201d you know that subtlety, or characters who actually speak like real humans, isn\u2019t what this is about. Still, for those who last saw Parkinson as the AC-12 officer Cottan in Line of Duty, where the plot revolved around the quest for the kingpin H and the implausible possibility that as he took his final breath he tapped out the letter in morse code, it\u2019s something of a relief that here he eschews Hs altogether.\nThe English Game does improve slightly after a truly dire opening episode, but the interest really lies in themes that are glimpsed almost out of the corner of the eye, shoved to the margins by the heavy-handed central narrative. Suter, for instance, is offered a huge lump sum plus improved wages to leave Darwen and join Blackburn Rovers, which he accepts because he needs the money to rescue his mother and sister from his abusive father. Quite aside from the issue of whether it\u2019s legitimate, without any evidence, to portray an actual person, albeit one who died more than a century ago, as a wife-beater, there\u2019s a more universal question. Why shouldn\u2019t Suter take the better offer? Darwen had paid to lure him from Partick and then they themselves were outbid: once professionalism has been accepted, why should there be a perceived need to give Suter an excuse for moving?\nOther than giving one of the principal characters a troubled backstory, what is gained by blurring the central dilemma of professionalism, that without adequate checks money will dominate \u2013 something all too apparent in the super-club era \u2013 and that the transformation of the game into a job, while beneficial and necessary in opening it up to all, also inevitably erodes to an extent the camaraderie and athletic purity that are so central to the notion of sport as somehow spiritually improving?\nIt\u2019s a thought that occurs now in discussions about a putative super-league. It\u2019s easy to rail against it, to anticipate the potential tedium of the same super-clubs endlessly grappling with each other, to think of the social damage done to the non-super-clubs cast into permanent semi-irrelevance by exclusion from the main competition, to rage against the victory of capital over community, but there\u2019s always also a thought of how history will view the debate. After 10 or 20 years of a super-league, and the brilliant football it would probably yield, would those arguments come to seem as irrelevant as those that once doubted the European club competitions, or British involvement in the World Cup, or, yes, professionalism and the formation of a league?\nIn The English Game, the toffs object to the working-class northern teams largely for reasons of status. And perhaps that\u2019s how it was: after all, even leaving overt snobbism aside, it\u2019s understandable that the university-educated teams who had codified the game not two decades earlier (in January 1864, the Football Association comprised eight south-eastern clubs plus Sheffield) would be resistant to an entirely different group of people taking over their game, particularly when they interpreted it in a very different way.\nThe tactical exposition in The English Game is clunkingly preposterous, but it\u2019s not without substance: the passing game the northern teams came to favour (in part because they were smaller than their better-fed public school counterparts and so would have been seriously disadvantaged if they had no way of manoeuvring the ball away from physical clashes) was very different to the head-on charging practised by the game\u2019s progenitors.\nAlthough the point is not made explicitly in the series, the reason Darwen had to travel to London for their FA Cup quarter-final replay against Old Etonians in 1879 is that it was stipulated that all games from the quarter-finals onwards had to be played in London (the first match was not, as depicted in The English Game, played at Eton, but at Kennington Oval) \u2013 a not unreasonable requirement when most of the teams were based in the south-east. It\u2019s notable that by the following season the regulation had been lifted, suggesting at least some flexibility on the part of the FA and a recognition that the geographic make-up of the game was changing.\nAnd it would go on to change, spreading across the world. The English game became the Austrian game, the Hungarian game, the Argentinian game and, particularly, the Uruguayan game. It became everybody\u2019s game, interpreted differently by every culture that embraced it. And that in turn created difficulties \u2013 as demonstrated in the tours made by British clubs to South America in the first half of the 20th century, which often became fractious with mutual misunderstanding, laying the ideological foundations for the controversy that would, for instance, overwhelm the 1966 World Cup quarter-final between England and Argentina. One of the fascinations of football is that it is simultaneously intensely local and utterly globalised, with all the tensions that brings.\nBut don\u2019t expect to see any of that on Netflix, where the toffs drink claret and the proles drink beer (or whisky if they\u2019re Scottish and having a bad time), the bank is forever foreclosing and an implausible number of goals are scored in the few seconds after kick-off. It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity missed.",

On Saturday there were 3,994 people in intensive care, down from a previous tally of 4,068.\nWhile the country\u2019s lockdown is set to continue until mid-April, the measures could be extended until 1 May, the emergency commissioner, Angelo Borrelli, said on Friday. In recent days much of the focus of the coronavirus crisis has shifted to the United States, where more than 290,000 people have tested positive.\nThe centre of the epidemic has been New York State, home to more than 3,000 of the country\u2019s 7,000 deaths from the virus. The state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said on Saturday that the Chinese government was facilitating the shipment of 1,000 ventilators to his state.\nItaly and Spain remain the world\u2019s hardest-hit countries, with a combined death toll of more than 27,000. Infections have soared to nearly a quarter of a million, leaving healthcare workers taking tremendous risks as they struggle to treat a seemingly endless queue of patients.\nIn Rome, the head of Italy\u2019s hospital doctors union fought back tears as he detailed the toll the crisis has taken on those on the frontlines. \u201cIt is an indescribable condition of stress,\u201d said Carlo Palermo, citing reports of two nurses that had committed suicide. \u201cI can understand those who look death in the eye every day, who are on the frontlines, who work with someone who maybe is infected, then a few days later you see him in the ICU or die.\u201d\nIn Spain, the health ministry said that more than 18,000 health workers were infected, making up around 15% of the confirmed cases in the country. Doctors and nurses in Spain have for weeks complained of a shortage of supplies, leaving them reusing masks and crafting their own protective shields from plastic bags.\nFigures released on Saturday by Spain\u2019s health ministry showed 809 deaths in the past 24 hours \u2013 the lowest daily death toll in seven days. The number of deaths now sits at 11,744, behind only Italy, while confirmed cases in the country have climbed to 124,736.\nOn Saturday, the country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, credited the country\u2019s near-total lockdown for helping to curb the spread of the virus. \u201cToday we know that these three weeks of isolation and collective sacrifices are bearing fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cThree weeks ago it was expanding daily by more than 20%, and today, it is fortunately at 6%.\u201d\nHe said his government would seek parliamentary approval to extend the country\u2019s lockdown until 26 April, extending measures such as the ban on social gatherings and ordering Spaniards to remain in their homes save for essential trips to a total of six weeks. \u201cWith the utmost caution, we believe that this is the time that our health system needs to recover,\u201d he added.\nOfficials in Germany reported a slight decrease in new cases, from 6,174 one day earlier to 6,082, as the chancellor, Angela Merkel said the national lockdown could stretch beyond Easter. \u201cThe rise in confirmed new cases is going a bit slower than a few days ago,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is definitively way too early to identify a trend and therefore it is also too early to ease some of the strict rules we have set for ourselves.\u201d Germany has 85,778 cases, while the virus has claimed 1,158 lives.\nIn Britain, where the daily death toll surged 20% to 708 on Saturday to a total of 4,313 deaths, a leading government adviser speculated that the lockdown could stretch into May. \u201cWe want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May we\u2019re able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now,\u201d Neil Ferguson, a leading professor at Imperial College London, told the BBC.\nAfter reporting 2,179 cases and 29 deaths, officials in Saudi Arabia on Saturday announced a lockdown and partial curfew in seven neighbourhoods of the Red Sea city of Jeddah, while Dubai\u2019s state news agency reported plans for a two-week lockdown.\nIn other developments:\nA senior Iranian health official has said that there may be a resurgence of coronavirus in and around the capital of Tehran, as residents flout restrictions. More than 3,400 people have died and 55,000 cases of Covid-19 have been officially declared in the country amid speculation that the actual figures could be higher.\nThe coronavirus death toll in France has reached 7,560 since 1 March, the health ministry has said. This figure includes hospitals and nursing homes.\nIn Portugal the number of confirmed cases surged past the 10,000 mark, with the country\u2019s health minister saying there was still \u201cno light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Speaking to reporters, Marta Temido said: \u201cThis fight is not a 100 metre race, it is a long marathon.\u201d\nThe United Arab Emirates has requested that Expo 2020 Dubai, set to launch in October, be postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIndonesia said on Saturday that coronavirus cases in the country had topped 2,000 and deaths had risen to 191, but doubts have been cast over official figures after data emerged showing a jump in funerals last month in the capital city of Jakarta.\nChina came to a standstill on Saturday to mourn patients and medical staff killed by the coronavirus, including \u201cmartyrs\u201d such as whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang. Air raid sirens sounded across the country as the world\u2019s most populous country observed three minutes of silence. On Saturday the country reported just one new confirmed case in Wuhan and 18 others among people arriving from abroad. There were four new deaths for an official total of 3,326.",

        "content": "Bondi is one of NSW\u2019s most famous destinations, drawing 2.6 million visitors a year. Has its popularity made it vulnerable to Covid-19?\nA block from Bondi Beach six female travellers, all aged between 22 and 31, share a two-bedroom flat, each paying $200 a week in rent.\nThey came to Australia, and settled in Bondi, for the work opportunities, the sun and the freedom.\nLast week, two of the women tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe Sydney beach suburb draws 2.6 million visitors each year, according to Destination New South Wales. It\u2019s a place of contrasts. Sparkling natural bounty and dense urban living. Billionaires and backpackers. Instagrammed bodies and old-timers\u2019 swimming clubs. A place obsessed with health and beauty but now, one of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 hotspots.\nBondi, part of Waverley council area, has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus, the local council\u2019s 159 cases as of Friday (101 of them in Bondi alone) knocking the sunshine out of the surfside playground.\nThis week, in response to Waverley\u2019s newfound status as home to both the highest number of Covid-19 cases and the highest number of locally transmitted cases in the state, the government opened a local pop-up testing clinic.\nWhile the advice during the global coronavirus pandemic is to stay home, the reality for some, especially in a place like Bondi, is that crowded living conditions make physical distancing difficult, even for the most prudent.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I was negative, I slept in the same room as two positive girls,\u201d says one of the Argentinian housemates who was given the all-clear, who did not want to be named. \u201cI was staying home, worrying about the virus outside, but it was in my own place.\u201d\nUnsure where to turn, she appealed to the authorities for help and her infected housemates \u2013 one of whom is suspected to have caught the virus in the house \u2013 were moved into quarantine in hotels, paid for by the government.\nFor the others, a sense of gratitude has settled on the flat: they and their sick housemates are safe and isolated, friends are helping with food deliveries and a neighbour has lent them exercise equipment. She has heard of worse, including newly jobless, homeless travellers who cannot get to their home countries, and infected members of shared houses who have stayed put.\nThey\u2019re like many temporary working visa holders who continue to share cramped homes, some of 12 to 15 people, across the suburb. Since 20 March, hostels, meanwhile, have had to comply with new distancing rules of one person every 4 sq metres. At Noah\u2019s Backpackers, just along from James Packer\u2019s erstwhile beach house, every room, including six-bed dormitories, were made single occupancy.\nThe landmark building has a view down on to the Bondi Beach that is usually alive with crowded surf and its famous lifeguards. On 21 March, the beach was closed, its entrances hastily fenced off. With no surfers and sunbathers, Bondi Beach has never looked so bare. Now in the spotlight as the centre of Australia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, the suburb has never felt quite so exposed.\nThe scene is a far cry from images just over two weeks ago, when crowds from well beyond Sydney\u2019s east took to the sand on a 36C day, flouting social distancing rules and the new 500-person limit on outdoor gatherings. A hot Friday with family-friendly surf is what Bondi does best \u2013 but by the next afternoon and in the glare of global media, police were sweeping the beach of sunbathers, forbidding even surfers to enter the water. For the first time, the beach known around the world as an icon of Australia\u2019s natural beauty and symbol of our love of the sea and sun is now associated with something far less glamorous.\nWhen New South Wales chief health Officer Dr Kerry Chant singled out backpackers and their potential to infect the community when outlining the response, she directed public focus towards Bondi\u2019s reputation as a destination for travellers, already in the headlines because of a coronavirus cluster traced to a tropical-themed party at a popular Bondi beachfront bar.\nFrom Noah\u2019s Backpackers, the view is bleak. A few weeks ago, the hostel was bustling with 266 guests. Now, it\u2019s desolate, with manager Dylan Tenbrink closing its doors last Wednesday, saying it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to stay open under the new regulations around social distancing as well as media scrutiny. Unfounded rumours of a positive case of the virus in the hostel were unfairly targeting backpackers and the result was fear among both visitors and the community, he says.\n\u201cBondi\u2019s one of the greatest suburbs in the entire world. There\u2019s opportunity, it\u2019s safe, there\u2019s freedom for everybody,\u201d Tenbrink told Guardian Australia in the days before the hostel shut. \u201cNow, people see you walk [out of the hostel] and they shout at you and say it\u2019s an epicentre of disease.\u201d\nWith a young, international demographic and thousands of daily visitors, Bondi\u2019s infection rate comes as little surprise to local photographer and Aquabumps gallery owner, Eugene Tan. He has photographed Bondi Beach at daybreak for the last 21 years, and the daily surf photos are known worldwide.\n\u201cBondi\u2019s a brand, everybody knows it. You come to Sydney, you come to Bondi. It\u2019s a welcoming place,\u201d he says. It\u2019s that spirit that might have landed Bondi in the situation it\u2019s in today.\n\u201cThe police cleared the beach on Saturday and then all the bars filled up. It\u2019s a melting pot, which I love, but Bondi gets out of hand easily \u2013 we have a lot of travellers and they have a carefree attitude.\u201d\nBut to point to the backpacker community alone as responsible for local infection rates is to miss the reality of Bondi\u2019s broader community.\nThe suburb has long been home to professionals and young families from all over the world and less than half of its population is born in Australia, with many residents from Europe, South Africa, America and Brazil. At a local childcare centre where a parent tested positive for the virus, children speak Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. Long-haul travel, responsible for bringing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections into Australia but also for connecting expats with their families, is as much a way of life as the beach.\nThe Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, says it is the kindness of the community and its adaptability that stands it in good stead for the future. \u201cWe are all in this together.\u201d\nBrand Bondi, after all, reaches well beyond its bay and, to Tan, its pull is stronger than ever. He has been receiving messages from people all over the world telling him how images of Bondi are keeping them sane during lockdown.\n\u201cWithout the beach,\u201d he says, \u201cyou feel a bit lost.\u201d",

        "content": "As global heating makes coral bleaching a regular event, scientists are urgently seeking ways to help the world\u2019s biggest reef survive\nWhen coral scientist Dr Zoe Richards left the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s Lizard Island in late January, she was feeling optimistic.\nRichards is a taxonomist. Since 2011 she has recorded and monitored 245 coral species at 14 locations around the island\u2019s research station, about 270km north of Cairns.\nIn 2017 she saw \u201cmass destruction of the reef\u201d. Back-to-back mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017, and cyclones in 2014 and 2015, had wreaked havoc.\nBut in January, she saw thousands of new colonies of fast-growing Acropora corals that had \u201cclaimed the space\u201d left by dead and degraded corals. In a three-year window without spiralling heat or churning cyclones, some corals were in an adolescent bloom \u2013 not mature enough to spawn, but getting close.\n\u201cIt was an incredible recovery,\u201d says Richards, of Curtin University. \u201cBut I knew if it was hit again, it would be trouble \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d\nIn 2020, mass bleaching returned to Lizard Island \u2013 perhaps not as badly as in previous years \u2013 but enough, says Richards, to turn the clock back on the recovery she had seen.\nDay 1 of coral biodiversity re-surveys @ Lizard I, GBR. After 2 cyclones & 2 bleaching events in a decade, it's great to see a range of healthy young Acropora colonies fighting back! #coralnotcoal#recoveryispossibleA. echinata (blue), A. speciosa (pink) & A. spathulata (orange) pic.twitter.com/CO7BhJdu72\nThis summer has delivered a third mass bleaching for the reef in just five years. The back-to-back bleaching of 2016 and 2017 was mostly confined to the northern and central sections.\nData from aerial surveys is still being analysed, but the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has said preliminary results suggest the 2020 bleaching had a much broader footprint.\nWhen bleaching is mild, corals can and do recover, although it can make them more susceptible to disease. But severe bleaching can kill corals. Estimates are that the 2016 bleaching killed about 29% of the reef\u2019s shallow water corals and the 2017 event took another 19%.\nSome scientists are now concerned global heating may have reached a point where tropical reefs bleach almost every year.\nWhat this means for the reef in the coming decades is an area of live research and debate among scientists.\nScientists Guardian Australia spoke to say the reef\u2019s fortunes hang on the answers to two questions.\nThe first is whether governments around the world will make deeper cuts to greenhouse gas emissions than they have already agreed and, if so, how close they will get to keeping global heating to 1.5C.\nA second is whether efforts to first identify and then deploy a swathe of potential measures that could reduce the impact of rising temperatures will be successful.\nWhat seems clear is that without some human intervention, the magic of the world\u2019s greatest coral reef system will be lost.\nProf Peter Mumby, professor of coral reef ecology at the University of Queensland, is the chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Foundation \u2013 the once-small not-for-profit that was awarded a controversial $443m government grant in 2018.\nHe said the 2020 bleaching \u201cis giving us greater pause, given it seems we can see quite frequent coral bleaching events earlier than people had previously expected\u201d.\nMumby says bleaching events have been \u201cpatchy\u201d, and the fact that some areas have escaped \u201cmeans there\u2019s an opportunity for management\u201d.\nWhat keeps the reef functioning as a single ecosystem is the way each reef connects to another through the way corals reproduce. They all either spawn, or produce larvae, that can float in the water column and settle on nearby reefs.\nMumby and colleagues have identified about 100 reefs along the GBR that are well spread, well connected to other reefs by ocean currents, and tend to experience cooler temperatures.\nHe says making sure those reefs stay as healthy as possible \u2013 in particular by managing outbreaks of the coral-eating crown of thorns starfish \u2013 could be crucial in keeping the wider reef viable.\nThe reef\u2019s unrivalled size and diversity \u2013 almost 4,000 reefs, cays and islands stretching for more than 2,000 kilometres \u2013 gives it extra resilience, he says.\nClimate change is still the reef\u2019s biggest threat and society will need to focus on tackling it, \u201cbut there needs to be a way to adapt to how we manage reefs so that they can roll with the punches \u2013 we have to do both those things\u201d.\nThe Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS) has produced an as-yet unpublished study, sent to the federal government, that reviews more than 160 different interventions that have been suggested for the reef, identifying about 40 that could be worth further study.\nDr Lina Bay, a principal research scientists at AIMS, says one promising area of study is what\u2019s known as \u201cassisted gene flow\u201d, where the spawn of corals with better tolerance for heat could be captured and then dispersed.\n\u201cNot all corals are created equal,\u201d she says. \u201cSome have a higher stress tolerance than others. Over many years we\u2019ve shown that the variation in bleaching tolerance is hereditable \u2013 it gets passed from parents to offspring.\u201d\nShe says these differences can exist even among the same species, meaning those corals can be selectively grown in a lab setting to promote more heat tolerance.\nAIMS scientist Dr Neal Cantin has just finished a three-year experiment with one fast-growing coral species called Pocillopora acuta, which behaves like a weed by filling in the gaps when less hardy corals die off.\nStarting with 90 parent specimens taken from three different parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Cantin and colleagues grew 7,500 offspring and then subjected them to rising levels of CO2 and temperatures of up to 2C warming.\nEven at high temperatures, some of these corals survived, and they were able to tolerate higher levels of heat as the experiment went on.\nHaving a street-fighting weedy coral like this is important, says Cantin. Dead areas of coral reefs tend to get covered in algae, but Cantin says a weedy coral that can compete with the algae can then make room for slower-growing corals to also grow.\n\u201cThe whole goal of a lot of these interventions is to work with species that can be successful on their own. We won\u2019t be able to work with 600 species of corals, but we could probably work with 20 that fill the functional roles of a healthy reef community.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t deny bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe and they\u2019re impacting across a bigger area than before. We can just document that demise, or we can learn from it and have some corals for future generations.\u201d\nThat demise is clear and it happens at scale, and also in detail. Zoe Richards has already seen evidence of likely local extinctions of some corals at Lizard Island. One is a spiralised plate coral \u2013 Acropora clathrata \u2013 that she hasn\u2019t been able to find for years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s these silent extinctions that go on,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe entire reef is operating like one big meta population with sub-populations that are connected to each other. If you successively take out nodes in that population, sooner or later you will end up with parts that don\u2019t connect. It will be fragmented into subsets that will continue to erode in terms of diversity. It\u2019s degradation of the [coral] community at a very large scale.\u201d\nProf Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, has done pioneering work on the study of coral bleaching going back to the mid-1980s.\nHe remembers Lizard Island as a \u201cpicture perfect\u201d place to do research on corals in the late 80s, when his research there found rising temperatures caused corals to lose their \u201csymbionts\u201d \u2013 the algae that lives in the coral and gives them much of their nutrients and colour.\nThe Great Barrier Reef\u2019s first major mass bleaching event happened in 1998. There was another in 2002, and again in 2016, 2017 and 2020.\nHoegh-Guldberg says: \u201cWe knew there was a temperature effect, and we knew that temperatures were going up. At the end of the 90s, I could put those two things together.\u201d\nThe year after the reef\u2019s first mass bleaching, Hoegh-Guldberg took climate models to forecast that if greenhouse gas emissions kept growing then, by 2020, \u201cthe average bleaching event is likely to be similar or greater than the 1998 event\u201d.\nAs 2020 approached, the models showed reefs across the northern, central and southern regions would see between eight and 10 bleaching events per decade.\n\u201cI wished I\u2019d been wrong\u201d he says. \u201cI think I said at the time that I\u2019d have egg on my face if I was wrong. But there\u2019s no egg on my face.\u201d\nHoegh-Guldberg says manually replanting corals is uneconomic at scale but there\u2019s merit in helping the dispersal of coral larvae, pointing to a technique being developed by a scientist at Southern Cross University that captures millions of larvae in floating pools.\nBut he says the main game is keeping global heating down.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say we get to 1.5C and then we can stabilise \u2013 that\u2019s really the last call for reefs. Corals will come back and there will be winners and losers, but you\u2019ll have a functional reef that supports fisheries and tourism.\u201d\nThe problem is that right now, government pledges under the Paris agreement are enough to raise temperatures by 3C \u2013 not 1.5C.\n\u201cAt 2C all the reef-building corals have plummeted and instead you are looking at the dominance of other organisms like algae. At 3C you basically have nothing.\n\u201cI\u2019m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me up at night.\u201d",

        "content": "As concern grows for people in aged care confined to their room due to coronavirus, some children report their parents are putting on a brave face\nAfter one month of being confined to their rooms, some residents of a Sydney aged care home at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak have been allowed to take a short walk outside.\nThey went one at a time, escorted by an aged care worker. Among them was 68-year-old Christine Fennell, who has been living at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge since last year.\nShe was allowed to take two short supervised walks. It is the most exercise she has had in 30 days, since the first case of coronavirus was detected at the Macquarie Park facility. Since then five of the home\u2019s elderly residents have died after testing positive to Covid-19, and 17 other people \u2013 12 residents and five staff \u2013 have also tested positive.\nFennell, who has a persistent cough from a lingering chest infection, was tested for the virus on Friday 13 March, although her son, Thomas Wright, has not yet received the result. He assumed no news was good news until he received a letter from the BaptistCare general manager of residential services, Allan Waters, on 3 April, saying the centre had \u201cexperienced new cases of residents testing positive to Covid-19 after previously testing negative\u201d.\nWaters wrote that it was a \u201cconcerning situation\u201d. He said the home had been inspected by an infection control specialist that day, who recommended a change when staff wear hospital gowns as part of their personal protective equipment. He also said that 65% of the centre\u2019s regular staff, who had been in self-isolation, were now back at work.\nThe death of the fifth resident, a 95-year-old woman, was reported on Wednesday. Ross Low, the chief executive of BaptistCare, which runs the facility, said the loss was \u201cincredibly difficult, especially knowing just how hard everyone is working to care for our residents and staff\u201d.\nThe same message was sent via text message to family members.\nBaptistCare declined to answer further questions or participate in an interview with Guardian Australia.\nThe residents themselves are told very little.\n\u201cWhen I am calling mum, she does not know these things,\u201d Wright says. \u201cShe is hearing this from me. The outside world in her head is still where it was a month ago. She was quite surprised to hear that Sydney is in lockdown.\u201d\nThe first message of the outbreak came on the afternoon of 4 March. It began: \u201cDear residents and families of BaptistCare, we are writing to inform that a staff member at Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park, has been confirmed to have the coronavirus.\u201d\nThe employee was a 50-year-old woman, an aged care worker, who had tested positive the day before. The source of her infection has still not been determined. It was the first case of untraced community transmission in Australia.\nThe message continued that \u201cany staff or residents identified as being at risk are isolated\u201d.\nThat evening Wright says his mother was told not to come to the dining hall for dinner.\nThe next day, 5 March, health authorities in New South Wales confirmed that a 95-year-old woman, who was a resident of the home and had died in hospital on Tuesday night, before the first infection at the home was announced, had also tested positive to Covid-19. The virus had spread \u2013 an 82-year-old man and a 70-year-old man had also tested positive.\nAll other residents were confined to their rooms, although Guardian Australia understands that order was not strictly adhered to for several days.\nA number of the regular staff at the centre did not turn up to work, fearing infection. Apart from close contacts, staff were not immediately told to self-isolate. Some did not receive that order until two days later.\nFennell, confined to her small self-contained room, did not receive lunch until 4pm that day when it arrived on a tray carried \u201cby a stranger in a hazmat suit\u201d, Wright says. Her room is next to a kitchen, where she could ordinarily prepare food outside of meal times. But since the outbreak, she has been confined to her room without even the ability to make herself a cup of tea.\nBy Sunday 8 March, an 82-year-old man died, bringing Australia\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus to three. As of Saturday it sat at 30.\nDorothy Henderson Lodge is managed in wings or pods, with limited staff movement between wings to limit the spread of ordinary infectious diseases that can spread through an aged care home, like influenza or gastroenteritis. When the virus was first detected centre management locked down the problem wing and isolated staff identified as close contacts of the infected staff member and residents.\nBut the 70-year-old man lived in a different pod to the first reported cases. When he tested positive, it showed the virus had spread despite these efforts to contain it.\nA spokeswoman from NSW Health says staff from the department visited the lodge on 3 March and \u201cinitiated isolation of residents and enhanced infection control precautions among staff\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the time taken to identify and notify staff who were close contacts resulted in further transmission of the disease,\u201d the spokeswoman says.\nThe response was perhaps not as swift as it would be if a similar outbreak were reported today. But it was the first week of March: a lifetime ago in Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus. Overseas travel was still allowed and returning travellers were not told to isolate, only monitor themselves for respiratory symptoms. The magnitude of the crisis had not yet sunk in.\n\u201cI do think that they [BaptistCare] were taken, and the sector has been taken, a bit by surprise,\u201d says Ian Yates, the chief executive of Council on the Ageing Australia. \u201cAnd to some degree they have swung too much the other way. In some places there are no cases at all but they have gone into complete lockdown and not let family visit at all.\u201d\nBaptistCare announced it was banning all visitors to all of its homes on 18 March, the same day the federal government said visits to people in aged care homes would be limited to one per day with a maximum of two people. Other nursing homes followed suit in increasing the government\u2019s recommendation to a voluntary visitor ban.\nThere are already reports, says Yates, of people in aged care homes across the country \u201cdeclining\u201d due to being deprived regular visits or confined to their rooms, with reports of increased mental health concerns and de-cognition.\u201d\n\u201cOlder people decondition really quickly,\u201d Yates says.\nWright says his mother has put a brave face on her isolation \u2013 she has learned how to use video conferencing app Zoom and is speaking to him daily.\n\u201cShe has a big pile of DVDs there,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not sure that she has made her way through all of them.\u201d\nGerard Hayes, the secretary of the NSW branch of the Health Services Union, says the aged care sector has acted \u201cmuch faster to act than the federal government\u201d to shut down homes and protect residents.\n\u201cThe fact we have seen just four aged care facilities in NSW with confirmed cases clearly demonstrates that aged care workers are doing an incredible job at keeping vulnerable residents safe,\u201d Hayes says.",

A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.\u201d\nShe will also address how the nation has responded, saying: \u201cI hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country.\u201d\nThe message will include a thank you to those on the NHS frontline, care workers and those carrying out essential roles. It will also recognise the pain already felt by many families and thank those who are following the official guidance to stay at home to protect the vulnerable.\nThe Queen, who is said to remain in good health, recorded her message at Windsor Castle, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, are staying for the foreseeable future during the pandemic.\nApart from her Christmas message, it is rare for the monarch to make a special address. She did so at the time of the Gulf war in 1991, on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, on the death of the Queen Mother in 2002, and on the occasion of her diamond jubilee in 2012.\nAdvice was sought by the Queen\u2019s medical household over how best to mitigate the risk to her and others during the recording. As a result, the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle was specifically chosen so that an appropriate distance could be maintained.\nIt had to be big enough to allow sufficient distance between her and the sole BBC cameraman, who was the only other person in the room and was wearing PPE (personal protective equipment). All other technical staff were located in another room and connected by speakers.\nA senior No 10 official said: \u201cThe prime minister and Her Majesty the Queen have been speaking regularly and No 10 and Buckingham Palace have been speaking throughout about Her Majesty the Queen\u2019s address. The Queen is the best judge of when to talk to the country and we absolutely agree that now is the right time.\n\u201cWe have asked the country to make huge sacrifices and life is very difficult at the moment for a great many people. Hearing from Her Majesty the Queen at this time is an important way of helping to lift the nation\u2019s spirits.\u201d\nPrince Charles, who came out of self-isolation a week ago having tested positive for Covid-19, offered his own tributes to the NHS as he officially opened NHS Nightingale London via video link on Friday. Speaking from his home at Birkhall, Scotland, he praised the \u201cspectacular and almost unbelievable feat of work\u201d undertaken to build the field hospital at the ExCeL conference centre in east London in just nine days.\n\u201cIn this dark time this place will be a shining light. It is symbolic of the selfless care and devoted service taking place in innumerable settings by countless individuals throughout the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "New Labour chief calls Johnson after election victory as new coronavirus cases fall but death toll rises by 708\nKeir Starmer has vowed to work with Boris Johnson \u201cin the national interest\u201d to guide Britain through the mounting coronavirus outbreak, after the prime minister published a letter urging leaders of opposition parties to \u201cwork together\u201d with the government.\nIn a phone call with the prime minister after being elected Labour leader, Starmer offered to work constructively with the prime minister and not provide \u201copposition for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d. However, with pandemic experts warning this weekend about the difficult route out of the lockdown, Starmer said he would \u201ccall out\u201d the government over failings in its strategy.\nStarmer has agreed to meet the prime minister this week. Johnson remained in self-isolation on Saturday with a temperature after he contracted the virus. The pledge between the party leaders came as:\n Numbers of daily new cases of Covid-19 dropped from 4,450 on Friday to a total of 3,735, leading to hopes that the disease\u2019s spread could be levelling off. Total numbers of UK cases of the disease now stand at 41,903. An additional 708 people died.\n It emerged that 212 patients in the Midlands have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the last 24 hours \u2013 more than London, which has been hit hardest so far, which had 127 deaths.\n There were signs of a slight drop in public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. An Opinium poll for the Observer found that approval of the government\u2019s handling dropped from a net approval of +42% last week to +23% this week.\n Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, warned that there was evidence that the young were less compliant with social distancing orders, as he pleaded with the public to show \u201cself-restraint\u201d and follow the lockdown measures.\n It was announced that the Queen will praise the nation for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic in a rare televised address broadcast on Sunday.\nThe Cambridge University statistician, Sir David Speigelhalter, said the drop in the number of new cases gave grounds for optimism. \u201cI am relieved. We should be seeing a flattening of the upward curve of new cases and these figures are entirely compatible with such a trend. It looks like we are beginning to see a levelling off of the disease\u2019s spread,\u201d he said.\nBut as ministers plead with the public to stay home, there are concerns in Whitehall over maintaining the lockdown in the weeks ahead. One source said: \u201cIf numbers turn, front pages saying we\u2019re winning the war, that will be tough. Broadly at the moment, no one is going outside. If that changes, it could change quickly.\u201d\nThere was also a warning from a leading pandemic expert that failings \u201cranging from lack of preparedness to complacency\u201d meant that there was now no alternative to building immunity in the population, either through gradual infection or vaccination \u2013 which could be more than a year away.\nFrancois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London genetics institute, said: \u201cI personally, cannot see any viable alternative to ensuring immunity builds up in the population, through infection or vaccination. What is critical is to minimise hospital overload, to ensure mortality is kept as low as possible. There was a window of opportunity earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, where it could have been controlled. We missed it, for various reasons, ranging from lack of preparedness to complacency. We should analyse our failings in the future, but now is not the time for blame.\u201d\nA No 10 spokesperson responded: \u201cAs set out by the prime minister, we are working to a scientifically-led, step-by-step action plan \u2013 taking the right measures at the right time.\u201d\nHowever, there is now an open debate in Whitehall and the scientific community about the best route out of the lockdown measures, which government advisers have suggested may need to be in place until the end of May.\nProfessor Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, pointed to successful strategies employed in other countries. These have involved very large-scale testing and as much contact tracing as possible, to identify people with the virus. \u201cThis strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in testing at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing,\u201d Hibberd added. \u201cHowever, we should now be able to overcome these problems.\u201d\nMark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University highlighted three key strategies for dealing with the epidemic. \u201cOnce lockdown has driven down the virus to low enough levels in the community we can go back to chasing down individual cases. At the same time we build more ICU capacity in the NHS so we can relax the lockdown without the health service being overwhelmed. And thirdly, we place new emphasis in shielding the vulnerable.\u201d\nBy contrast, John Edmunds, also of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argued that the only way to proceed was to continue with the lockdown policy for many months. \u201cTesting on its own will not stop this epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want the NHS to cope then you will have to take extreme measures for a long time. There is no way out. We will have social distance for many months or hospitals will be overwhelmed. Mass testing, mass contact tracing and more technology are fine, but what we really need is a vaccine.\u201d\nStarmer used his acceptance address to vow that the country could not go \u201cback to business as usual\u201d once the pandemic was under control. \u201cThis virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change,\u201d he said.\nYesterday, Carrie Symonds, the prime minister\u2019s pregnant partner, revealed she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms of Covid-19, but said she was \u201con the mend\u201d.\n This article was amended on 5 April 2020 to correct a quote from Sir David Spiegelhalter.",

In a rambling and furious answer, the president claimed not to know and never to have met an official he nonetheless insisted did \u201ca terrible job\u201d and was \u201ca disgrace to inspector generals\u201d.\n\u201cIt was my decision,\u201d to fire Atkinson, the president said, adding: \u201cI have the absolute right to do so.\u201d\nThe whistleblower, supposedly guaranteed anonymity under federal law, has been named by Republican politicians, rightwing media figures and Trump, who retweeted a message in which the official was named.\n\u201cEveryone knows who the whistleblower is,\u201d Trump said on Saturday, adding: \u201cFrankly someone ought to sue his ass off.\u201d\nThe relaying of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint led to Trump being impeached by the Democratic-held House, where Schiff steered proceedings. But the president was acquitted in February after a trial in the Republican Senate in which Schiff led a team of managers prosecuting the House\u2019s case.\nSchiff\u2019s remark about Trump \u201cdecapitating\u201d the intelligence community also took in the departure of acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire, who also backed the whistleblower\u2019s action and was controversially replaced by a Trump loyalist, Richard Grenell.\nThe Axios website reported on Saturday that Trump is considering placing Steve Feinberg, a billionaire investor and political ally, in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nIn the heated atmosphere of Trump\u2019s Washington, language as forthright as that used by Schiff is common. For example, in January, as the impeachment trial began, CBS News reported that Republican senators had been warned that if they voted against the president, \u201cyour head will be on a pike\u201d.\nOnly one Republican, the Utah senator and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney, voted to convict the president and remove him from office.\nElsewhere in Washington on Saturday, the top US federal watchdog promised to continue to conduct \u201caggressive\u201d independent oversight of government agencies.\nMichael Horowitz, chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and the inspector general at the Department of Justice, said in a statement Atkinson was known for his \u201cintegrity, professionalism, and commitment to the rule of law and independent oversight\u201d.\nUS inspectors general, charged with independent oversight of federal agencies, were recently tasked with broad surveillance of the government response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the historic $2.3tn package to mitigate its economic impact.\n\u201cThe inspector general community will continue to conduct aggressive, independent oversight of the agencies that we oversee,\u201d said Horowitz.\n\u201cThis includes CIGIE\u2019s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee and its efforts on behalf of American taxpayers, families, businesses, patients and healthcare providers to ensure that over $2tn dollars in emergency federal spending is being used consistently with the law\u2019s mandate.\u201d\nDemocrats have expressed concerns about how the stimulus cash will be doled out.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the treasury department to be able to hand out to their friends,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.",

The new measures, introduced at 8pm on Saturday (1600 GMT), will see mobility restricted, with just one person per residence able to leave home for \u201cessential needs\u201d such as food and medicine. Supermarkets and pharmacies, alongside food and drug delivery services, will continue to work as normal and those working in \u201cvital sectors\u201d will be allowed to go out.\nDonald Trump has warned American citizens that the next two weeks will be the toughest, as the number of cases in the US pass 300,000. He also announced that thousands of military personnel would be deployed to states to help them tackle the coronavirus pandemic, with 1,000 directed to New York City.\nThe death toll in the state of New York increased by 630 in the last day, governor Andrew Cuomo announced, bringing its number of coronavirus-related deaths to 3,565. This was the largest daily increase in deaths in the state, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the US and has accounted for almost a quarter of the US\u2019s 8,291 deaths.\nA senior health official in Iran has warned that the area in and around the capital city of Tehran could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases after residents flouted restrictions. The warning came after many people ignored advice to stay at home, with crowding and traffic jams on the city\u2019s streets as the country\u2019s New Year holidays ended on Saturday.\nThe Tunisian parliament has given the government new powers to combat the spread of coronavirus and the expected economic fallout. These will allow the government to issue decrees, make purchasing agreements and seek finance without consulting parliament. The decision was backed by all political parties.\nThe president and ministers of Malawi will take a 10% cut to their salary and redirect the money to the country\u2019s efforts to fight coronavirus, president Peter Mutharika has said.

The number is expected to increase to \u201chundreds of thousands being delivered every week\u201d according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, but action has been much quicker on the ground. We speak to some of the heroes in the drive to keep the nation fed.\nSloughIn a little under three weeks, Ajmal Azam has helped support about 300 people in his local community by organising a network of food parcels, shopping and hot meals for those most in need. In another life, 36-year-old Azam is a full-time barrister practising in family law, a married father of two and a school governor. Now he spends six hours a day packing and delivering boxes of tinned goods, pulses, bread, fruit and veg. It\u2019s humbling, he admits, but crucial work.\n\u201cSlough Islamic Trust has supported this drive but it\u2019s not faith-specific,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the whole community \u2013 around 80% of people we\u2019ve been supporting are non-Muslim, they\u2019re older or have disabilities, are self-isolating or have no support networks.\u201d\nAzam drew up a roster of volunteers, and has been working alongside Sikhs in Slough, who are also operating a mobile food-support network for those who are over 65 and quarantined. \u201cWe called up Wexham, our local hospital, to ask what they needed, and a senior A&E sister pointed out that a number of nurses are in self-isolation and struggling to get basic necessities \u2013 so we put together 100 packages that day.\u201d\nWhile Azam has spent \u201cprobably more than \u00a31,000\u201d getting supplies together, he is keen to credit local grocers, supermarkets and takeaways that have been providing food and essentials. \u201cEveryone wants to help. That\u2019s incredible. My phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing since we put the first flyer out on social media. I do feel drained and exhausted at this stage but the impact we\u2019ve had is so endearing. I\u2019ve had so many messages from people that it\u2019s making a difference to. That\u2019s keeping me going.\u201d\nLondonChef Michey Chan is used to cooking up a storm. In his day job, heading up the staff kitchen at the Dorchester, he prepares an average of 900 meals for the lunch and dinner service. At Manorfield primary school in east London, where he is now feeding the children of key workers and teaching staff, the brief is a touch less intense but arguably a lot more satisfying.\n\u201cAndrea [restaurant manager at the Dorchester] and I now come in every day at 8.30am to start on the day\u2019s lunch service,\u201d he says. \u201cWe try to plan the meals two days in advance but it depends on what supplies we have, what has been donated and what needs to get used quickly.\u201d Supplies from Ottolenghi have been donated and local grocers are chipping in with goods. Veggie stews, vegan bolognese, salads and sweet pastries have all snuck on to the menu.\n\u201cThe kids have really good palates,\u201d says Chan. \u201cThey don\u2019t have bad eating habits and they\u2019re adventurous about trying a lot of things. Sometimes we have to bribe them with cookies but they try everything.\u201d\nIt has been two weeks since the Dorchester team took up residency in the school canteen, in an area that headteacher Paul Jackson describes as \u201cincredibly deprived\u201d. Over half the school is entitled to free school meals, and 72 pupils are on the child protection register. At the moment, anywhere between 12 and 20 children are coming in every day, with Manorfield operating as a hub for neighbouring schools.\nWith help from the Dorchester and the local authority, Jackson is now working on a scheme to get hot meals and food parcels delivered to vulnerable local families throughout the Easter holidays: \u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to feel useful \u2013 you don\u2019t notice the stress of everything until you\u2019re out of here. One thing is certain: even when things change, school meals here will never be the same again. The standards have been changed for ever.\u201d\nGlasgowIt began, as lockdown ideas now often do, over Whatsapp. Disheartened by the gloom shrouding Glasgow, jewellery maker Freya Alder got chatting to her friends \u2013 illustrator Isabella Burnell and textile designer Ruth Mitchell \u2013 about ways to lift the collective mood. The three launched the Maker\u2019s Raffle two weeks ago with pieces donated by a dozen Scottish ceramicists, potters, textile designers and printmakers, hoping to match the \u00a31,500 Alder had raised in December for Glasgow South East Foodbank.\n\u201cAfter the general election, I felt a huge sense of doom and powerlessness. Going to the Co-op the morning after and putting some stuff in the food bank made me feel infinitely better, which is where the idea was born,\u201d says Alder. The response this time round, however, has floored her.\n\u201cI did a little callout but people have been amazing. Our businesses are small and they\u2019ve been hit hard but we know other vulnerable people are struggling.\u201d\nGlasgow is the most deprived city in Scotland, with 34% of children estimated to be living in poverty. The trio have raised just over \u00a37,000 so far to help the most needy, with two more weeks left to go before the raffle is drawn. \u201cIt would be fun to hand over a big cheque at the end,\u201d says Alder, \u201cbut in practical terms, the food bank needs the money now so it\u2019s being sent over in weekly payments.\u201d\nDespite a significant loss of income for many of the one-person businesses trying to weather the current crisis, Alder reports that \u201cit\u2019s made us all feel better, I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s been so successful. Makers are uncomfortable trying to sell their wares when they know people are stretched thin, but this is a tiny little gesture anyone can join in.\u201d\nTickets are \u00a32. Alder\u2019s hope is that communities in other cities will copy the model to support food banks, which are desperate for donations nationwide. \u201cEvery city has a creative scene, and if every city did one of these it could make so much money for people who need it most,\u201d she said.",

Porter and McManus have spoken regularly in recent weeks.\nIn a bid to reassure the union movement over the broader legislation, Porter told reporters on Sunday the changes to workplace relations laws would be subject to a six-month expiry date, which could only be changed in future with parliament\u2019s backing.\nHe said the preparation of this legislation was \u201cone of the most important drafting exercises post-World War II\u201d because it would facilitate $130bn of \u201ceconomy-saving and job-saving expenditure\u201d over the next six months.\n\u201cThere is a lot of progress; it is occurring under enormous time pressure,\u201d he said in Canberra on Sunday.\nParliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending - to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight, which the Australian Tax Office would pay directly to businesses and not-for-profit organisations that have suffered sharp drops in turnover during the coronavirus pandemic.\nMcManus said the union movement had been raising concerns publicly and privately with the government about how it planned to implement the plan.\nMcManus said 1.1m casuals would miss out on the payment because they had not reached the test of at least 12 months of continuous employment with their employer.\nSpeaking on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program, McManus suggested an alternative test, saying \u201cif you could have reasonably expected to be working if it were not for the coronavirus, then you should get the jobkeeper allowance\u201d. This would include casuals who had shifts already booked or received a promise of work.\nPorter acknowledged on Sunday that many people were regularly employed casually but may move from employer to employer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on that and listening and so when you see the final draft you will see we are trying to be as inclusive and reasonable as possible,\u201d he said.\nMcManus also raised the plight of work visa holders who would miss out on the payments. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that they\u2019re not let to starve as well,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe other concern we\u2019ve got is a push by the government to change the Fair Work Act. We do not believe that this is necessary. We\u2019ve demonstrated that it is not necessary.\u201d\nMcManus pointed to recent changes to modern awards that had been put through the Fair Work Commission over the last couple of weeks, and covered millions of workers, as an example of how measures could be reached through cooperation rather than legislation.\nShe noted that not every award or enterprise agreement needed to change because some industries were doing well at the current time because of increased demand.\nMcManus raised concern that in some sectors, employers might \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201ctake advantage\u201d of changes to the Fair Work Act and called on Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers to oppose such provisions.\nUnions are worried that some employers may take advantage of provisions allowing them to direct workers to run down their existing leave entitlements.\nLabor raised similar concerns last week, saying if employees were forced to exhaust their leave entitlements, the new $1,500 fortnightly payment may be transformed from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers.\nPorter said he would share drafts of the legislation with the ACTU and work through the details \u201cin a cooperative, open, frank and honest way\u201d.\nBut he argued that failing to provide certainty through changes to the Fair Work Act could lead to additional job losses.\n\u201cWe will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be effected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements,\u201d Porter said.\n\u201cNo matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday: 6m Australian jobs depend on it. Next Wednesday, we are pushing a $130bn lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen and people will need to decide whether or not they\u2019re going to help us push the boat out.\u201d\nThe government also confirmed the special measures to be put in place to allow parliament to sit on Wednesday amid the current health crisis.\nThere are expected to be 47 \u201cpair\u201d arrangements in the House of Representatives, which would allow many MPs to be absent. Just 30 government MPs and 21 opposition MPs are likely to attend the lower house. Most of the crossbench MPs are likely to attend. Question time will be at 2pm as usual.\nPorter, who is also leader of the house, said special purpose aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force would assist in transporting MPs to and from Canberra, because of the lack of commercial flights. He indicated parliamentarians would comply with travel and border rules imposed by their states.\nThe manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, called on the government to schedule regular sittings of parliament - in this limited attendance form - to provide ongoing scrutiny and fix inevitable errors in drafting.\n\u201cAt a time of crisis, when the Australian people need us to get this right, the parliament meeting is more important than ever, and to think that after Wednesday we will not have to come back until August 11 is absurd,\u201d Burke said.",

        "content": "Banks are wicked and Rishi Sunak walks on water. That, at least, was the narrative that prevailed until the end of last week. The dashing new chancellor, the cabinet star of the coronavirus moment, had assembled the Treasury\u2019s armoury to provide lending to British businesses on unprecedented scale. It was only the damn banks that were stopping the cash reaching intended recipients.\nThis storyline now looks wrong. Sunak and the Treasury\u2019s \u201cfurther action\u201d,  announced on Thursday night to support struggling British firms, was not a mere tweak. It was a sweeping redesign of a lending scheme that had glaring flaws.\nYes, the lending banks probably have been too slow and plodding, but they weren\u2019t the primary block in getting money to thousands of businesses. Rather, they were trying to implement a wonky and fiddly package of the Treasury\u2019s creation.\nVersion two of the scheme looks much better, which is a relief. The main reform related to eligibility for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or Cbils, the part aimed at small businesses.\nIn the first outing, such government-backed interest-free loans could only be offered to businesses that could not secure finance in the normal way. Cue outrage among would-be borrowers who thought Sunak had promised them ultra-cheap loans but then found that the banks were first pushing standard finance with interest and fees.\nIn the rejigged arrangement, all viable borrowers can proceed directly to the juicier Cbils product. That could be a game-changer in solving individual companies\u2019 cash flow worries, but it\u2019s worth asking how the Treasury miscalculated in the first place.\nNo 11, one assumes, wanted to limit the risk to the public purse, a noble intention on the face of it because the government is on the hook for 80% of any loss of a Cbils loan. But the requirement to assess firms\u2019 eligibility for conventional finance meant Cbils wasn\u2019t having an impact. By Thursday night, only \u00a390m of loans had been approved to 983 businesses \u2013 barely scratching the surface of the problem.\nA similar point can be made about the contentious issue of personal guarantees on loans under \u00a3250,000. Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t, or were doing so in different circumstances. No wonder borrowers were angry. But the banks themselves were confused because the Treasury hadn\u2019t made clear what it wanted. Friday brought the clear instruction not to ask for guarantees. It could have been given on day one.\nSunak has also had to acknowledge his original design had a large hole in the middle. Cbils loans were limited to firms with an annual turnover of \u00a345m or less, with other would-be borrowers directed to the scheme for larger companies overseen by the Bank of England. That didn\u2019t work because mid-sized companies thought they needed a credit rating, which most don\u2019t have. Thus Cbils has now been extended, in effect, to firms with \u00a3500m of turnover, albeit that they\u2019ll pay interest on loans.\nBusiness groups have applauded the Treasury for listening to feedback. They\u2019re being polite. Many of the design flaws could surely have been anticipated if the Treasury had had a better feel for how small businesses think and act.\nSunak, it should be said, deserves praise for his \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme that will underwrite 80% of wages at affected companies. That is a genuinely big \u2013 and necessarily expensive \u2013 intervention that will save thousands of jobs.\nNor should we pretend that designing a loan scheme is easy. The current crisis, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, extends almost to the entire economy. And, to repeat, the banks still need to move. But it also needs to be stated: Cbils required urgent improvement because its original design was poor.\nThe bill for supporting British business through the crisis will be enormous. It could not be otherwise. The government is paying 80% of the wages of millions of workers across the UK to minimise job losses and ensure the economy is fit to recover when lockdown ends.\nThere will still be corporate failures \u2013 indeed, the destruction has started already on the high street with the collapse of Carluccio\u2019s and Laura Ashley. The only certainty is that action, in the form of the vast \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, will be cheaper than inaction in the long run.\nNot all beneficiaries are alike, however. When clothing retailer Arcadia put 14,500 employees into furlough last week, Philip Green became an indirect beneficiary of the public purse. Or, strictly speaking, his wife, Monaco-based Lady Green, got lucky since she is the owner of the struggling fashion empire that includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.\nThis, to put it mildly, feels appalling. The Greens banked a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 but are under no obligation to return a single penny to the business in the circumstances. And there\u2019s no point asking politely for a contribution. As we saw with the BHS pension scheme, the Greens had to be chased by parliamentarians and watchdogs before agreeing a \u00a3363m payment.\nThere is little, unfortunately, the government can do. It is virtually impossible to design a furlough scheme that does not apply equally to all companies.\nMinisters can, though, take a tough line when overseas-based billionaires beg for help beyond the generous furlough scheme. Virgin Atlantic, 51% owned by Richard Branson, is reportedly asking for a \u00a3500m package of soft loans and credit guarantees. The response to that should be simple: it\u2019s your turn to put your hand in your pocket.\nThere has never been a crisis like the current one. The onset of coronavirus has crippled the advanced world, as governments effectively shut down economic and social life as we know it. Unemployment is now starting to soar as companies run out of money amid the enforced lockdowns, with early indications that joblessness in the US and UK could surpass the depths of the 1930s Great Depression.\nThe jobs crisis is of our own making, an exercise in protecting the health of a nation at the expense of material wealth. It is entirely correct that a compassionate society should take such an approach. But the impact of the lockdown ought not to be overlooked: millions are facing unemployment and hardship.\nComparisons with the second world war and the Great Depression are overwrought. Rather than attempting full-scale mobilisation, Covid-19 is overcome by suppressing the economy as much as possible. And, unlike the Depression, hope still remains that this crisis will prove shorter than any other severe economic downturn in history.\nBut two historical comparisons ought to be kept in mind: the need for a New Deal akin to Roosevelt\u2019s in the 1930s, or the Marshall Plan of the 1940s, to reboot economic activity once the economy awakens from hibernation.\nWhen the dust finally settles on the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 a moment hoped for sooner rather than later \u2013 the government must throw as much weight behind reopening the economy as it did to shut it down.\nIn the short term, support packages are welcome, despite shortcomings that mean many are still left without adequate financial aid, as the Conservative government temporarily ditches political dogma dating back decades.\nFailure to support those who lose their jobs in this crisis will only cost Britain even more in the long run, from weaker economic growth and lost tax revenues.",

Neither guide nor history book, it is perfect to read before a visit, because turning the last page, you already feel you have a relationship with the city. Then it is just a question on arrival of forgetting about the usual sightseeing and getting lost in the labyrinth of narrow alleyways. I read it when it first came out, discovering many unknown things about my home town.\nVenice suffered apocalyptic flooding on 12 November 2019. The scenes are perfectly mirrored in the photography book Era Mare, a local initiative by photographer Matteo de Mayda and two graphic designers\u2013 all the profits are used to help the city survive. Rather than the usual pictures of a submerged Piazza San Marco, the book is an artistic documentary of the suffering of not just historic buildings, but the daily lives of local people during what we now term acqua grande.\nI was recently taking pictures of Venice emptied of people during the lockdown, and found myself in one of its most beautiful spots, the Campiello dei Miracoli. Well, we all need a miracle right now, but what came to mind was a scene from my favourite film set in Venice, Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), featuring stars Bruno Ganz and Licia Maglietta outside a florist \u2013 which of course never existed. I think many Venetians would cite this as their favourite film, because it does not try to glamorise the city as Death in Venice does.\nLiving here, we have to contend with filmmakers regularly taking over the city, but I have a soft spot for James Bond. Venice has been used as a backdrop for several 007 adventures. The scenes of Roger Moore zooming around our canals in a motorised gondola in Moonrakerstill make me laugh today.\nFew people associate Venice with football, but the Venezia FC stadium is just by the Biennale Gardens, and our team is one of the few things that belong to Venetians and not tourists. To get a feel, listen to Minuto per Minuto (raiplayradio.it), Italy\u2019s cult radio soccer programme, commenting on a day of games at the end of last season that saved Venezia FC from relegation. If the Italian gets too complex, fast forward to the last 10 minutes when we scored three goals to survive!\nMy mamma is a great cook, and the Sgaialand.it podcast evokes one of the most traditional Venetian dishes, risotto di go - goby fish risotto, which was much loved by Anthony Bourdain - as recounted by the owner of one of the city\u2019s most famous restaurants, Al Colombo di Venezia.\nThree museums along the Grand Canal that rarely draw the usual crowds are Ca\u2019Pesaro, for contemporary art, Palazzo Mocenigo, for textiles and fashion, and the Museum of Natural History. A virtual tour combining all 3 will certainly make you want to come back and visit the real thing once life returns to normal. Kids will be entranced by the dinosaurs, romantics will adore the period costumes in Mocenigo, and modern art lovers will be surprised at Ca\u2019Pesaro\u2019s collection.\nSeveral of the major islands on the Venice lagoon \u2013 Torcello, Murano, Burano \u2013 have their own specialist museums. Normal years see many tourists heading to Murano to visit its famous glass-blowing furnaces, so the Museo del Vetro there is usually busy. But the virtual tour offers a chance to discover one of the world\u2019s most important collections of glass, from Roman times to contemporary designers. There is an ongoing campaign by Murano\u2019s master glassblowers to protect their heritage against fakes that are often made in China, and even a virtual tour opens your eyes to the incredible craftsmanship that makes the island\u2019s glass unique.\nAvant-garde works by Claudio Ambrosini may not be for everyone, but he is one of Italy\u2019s most respected living composers and has won many awards, including the Golden Lion of the Venice Musica Biennale. His works \u2013 try 3 Studi En Plein Air: No 1 Notturno \u2013 have been performed in some of the world\u2019s major concert halls.\nAmbrosini\u2019s work has also been staged at our Fenice Opera House, and its website is also worth a visit to enjoy a full performance of Verdi\u2019s Don Carlos, while right now there is a moving video of a quartet performing Debussy\u2019s Clair de Lune as a homage to healthcare workers, each musician quarantined in their own apartment.\nA very different sound is Pitura Freska, every Venetian\u2019s favourite band. Playing a mix of ska, reggae and rock, singing in our dialect about the city\u2019s problems, they are as much a part of Venetian culture as Vivaldi. The band split up long ago, but their music lives on. When I am travelling, their album Na Bruta Banda transports me straight back to Venice.\n Giacomo Cosua is a Venetian photographer and founder of the online Posi+Tive Magazine\n This article was amended on 5 April 2020 to correct the spelling of La Serenissima.",

        "content": "Labour\u2019s new leader must honour his predecessor\u2019s policies and hold failing Tory government to account, says Momentum activist\nKeir Starmer\u2019s election as Labour leader marks the end of the Corbyn project and its domination of Labour\u2019s internal politics. Having barely lost an internal election in four years, the alliance that elevated Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership is now shredded \u2013 in equal parts defeated, disillusioned and defected. But the hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the left\u2019s re-emergence into British public life must not retreat into the shadows. The lessons of what went wrong must be learned \u2013 and the new leader must be pushed to understand that now is the time for bold ideas and opposition in response to the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis.\nThe arithmetic of Starmer\u2019s victory is relatively straightforward. In the summer of 2016, at the height of Corbyn\u2019s popularity, Owen Smith still scored 38% of the vote. All that Corbyn-sceptics had to do was get behind a candidate who could win over a small part of Corbyn\u2019s support base in the wake of a historic election defeat. Starmer\u2019s team knew that they could afford to run a boring, low-risk campaign \u2013 and that is exactly what they did.\nCorbyn\u2019s internal coalition was always very broad. It included much of the soft left of the party, and a large number of members who wanted to end austerity and break decisively from New Labour but whose politics didn\u2019t go much further. The big majority opposed Brexit, and most of them get their perspective on internal party politics in broad brushstrokes from reading the news, not in granular detail from attending meetings. Starmer was an ideal candidate to appeal to this base: authentically soft left, and having played a high-profile and relatively loyal role in the shadow cabinet.\nBut the most crucial factor at play was mass disillusionment within the Labour left, and the failure to deliver on the promise of 2015, despite Corbyn\u2019s own instincts. After some early moments of hope, Corbyn\u2019s leadership came to be run not by \u201ca new kind of politics\u201d but by the left wing of the old politics. Momentum\u2019s role as a brilliantly effective mobilising tool masked a lack of internal democracy that rotted its grassroots potential. The party management machine, familiar to long-suffering party activists of any era, shut down attempts to bring in open selections for MPs and ensured that key decisions were taken by professionals behind closed doors, not by members. This time it was staffed by people who read the Morning Star rather than Progress magazine.\nRebecca Long-Bailey was the continuity candidate for the outgoing leader\u2019s office, and inherited all of its baggage \u2013 including its ambiguous Brexit position and the attempt by some of her prominent supporters to \u201cblame Remain\u201d for the 2019 election result, when the vast majority of Labour members always opposed Brexit. This meant that the grassroots energy on which the left always relies simply was not there. In 2016, I worked 12-hour days on the campaign to get Corbyn re-elected. In 2020, I grudgingly, passively, lent Long-Bailey my vote in order to increase the left\u2019s perceived strength after the result. I don\u2019t think I was alone.\nKeir Starmer enters the leadership at a pivotal moment, and he will need the left in more ways than one. With the left out of power, Starmer must be held to his commitment to honour Corbyn\u2019s radical and popular economic policies. And with a failing government coronavirus strategy likely to leave people destitute and cause thousands of unnecessary deaths, Starmer\u2019s response has so far been too cautious and lacking in bite.\nWe badly need an opposition that can pull no punches in holding the government to account, breaking with any false idea of national unity and putting unprecedented progressive social measures on the table. In that task, the spirit of Corbynism may well be kept alive.\nMichael Chessum was a former member of the Momentum steering committee",

China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased. It also reported 47 new asymptomatic cases.\nDonald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans would see \u201ca lot of death\u201d. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success. The drug repeatedly pushed by Trump, hydroxychloroquine, has only shown anecdotal promise.\nWith deaths from Covid-19 cases in New York topping 3,000, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced he had received help from China for ventilator supplies. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described the crescendo of cases to come as \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy\u201d. Cuomo said he had obtained 1,000 ventilators from the Chinese government with the help of billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and the Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Oregon had loaned New York another 140, he said. Donald Trump tried to claim credit for the 1,000 ventilators, saying \u201ctwo very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators\u201d.\nNew Zealand passes Coronavirus cases in New Zealand have passed the 1,000 mark, with health officials reporting 89 new cases on Sunday. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern praised those who had complied with the country\u2019s strict lockdown but said there were \u201cstill some people I would charitably describe as idiots\u201d, citing a man in Christchurch who filmed himself coughing on people. The country has now recorded 1,039 confirmed cases, with one death.\nThe number of confirmed cases in Spain has swollen to 124,870 , passing Italy\u2019s 124,632 and making it the country with the second highest number of cases in the world, behind the US. Italy\u2019s death toll is still the world\u2019s worst, however, and it passed the grim milestone of 15,000 on Saturday.\nHealth authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation\u2019s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need.",

The study, conducted by Leeds Beckett University on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency, also discovered that nearly a quarter of athletes surveyed feared they would be labelled as a \u201csnitch\u201d if they expressed their suspicions.\nThe report, the first of its kind to be conducted among elite athletes and coaches in the UK and US, also found that the vast majority of respondents admitted the negative reaction towards whistleblowers could discourage them to come forward if they saw evidence of wrongdoing.\nA total of 301 athletes from 54 sports \u2013 all of whom had represented their country at international level \u2013 along with 139 coaches were questioned for the 140-page study, \u201cBlowing the whistle on doping in sport through evidence-informed policy making\u201d.\nDr Kelsey Erickson, the lead researcher, said her work showed that changes needed to be made to encourage more people to come forward if they had suspicions of wrongdoing. \u201cIn recent years we have seen a huge increase in the number of reporting mechanisms available for athletes and coaches to blow the whistle,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cYet while we found they often want to come forward, they often don\u2019t know who to voice their concerns to, and they don\u2019t necessarily trust action will be taken.\u201d\nErickson said most coaches (93%) and athletes (83%) felt that reporting doping was their responsibility, but barriers to reporting were evident throughout the research. Just 45% of coaches and 38% of athletes surveyed felt their sport actively encourages them to report doping, for instance, while fewer than half were aware of Wada\u2019s whistleblower programme.\n The report makes clear that establishing a culture of feeling able to speak up and have confidence that concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon \u2013 is the most important element of whistleblowing.\nAs Erickson pointed out, fewer than a quarter of coaches (23%) and athletes (19%) surveyed felt that the public reaction to those who have reported doping in sport would encourage them to do the same.\n\u201cWhat really stood out for me was the incredible courage, strength and determination it takes to come forward and report misconduct in sport,\u201d added Eriksson, who is now director of safe sport at USA Cycling.\n\u201cOften people feel they should only report their suspicions if they have hard evidence. But the message to them should be that they don\u2019t have to do the investigation themselves. And that little piece of information they provide could be the last bit in the jigsaw.\u201d\nTo raise awareness of the research, a video detailing the experiences of courageous individuals who blew the whistle on doping will be released this month. Produced by the Northern Film School at Leeds Beckett University, the research team hopes the video will help remove the barriers to speaking up to protect the integrity of sport.\nProfessor Sue Backhouse, director of research at the Carnegie School of Sport at Leeds Beckett, also hoped the study would lay the foundations for Wada to develop better policies to encourage the reporting of doping.\n\u201cOur findings underscore the need to celebrate those who show courage by coming forward with information of rule violations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to recognise the vulnerability of those who do so within global policies and procedures.\n\u201cGiven this vulnerability and the uncertainty felt by those who do report, Wada needs to emphasise the positive difference individuals and groups can make when they come forward with information on wrongdoing.\n\u201cWada and their broader community now need to work together to establish a culture where people feel able to speak up and have confidence that their concerns will be listened to \u2013 and acted upon.\u201d",

The total estimated loss for the track, its owners and nearby businesses is expected to reach around \u00a360m.\nBookmakers, meanwhile, will be missing out on around \u00a3400m in turnover, and their best annual opportunity to attract new customers. The Scottish Grand National, which was due to be staged at Ayr on 18 April, is also one of the most popular betting races of the year.\nIreland cancelled the remainder of its 2019-20 jumps season this week, including the Punchestown Festival at the end of this month, but will still aim to reschedule the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse as part of an \u201cenhanced\u201d jumping programme later in the year.\nThe Grand National at Aintree, however, is a much bigger beast than its Irish counterpart by any measure, from its attendance (65,000 versus 12,500) to its traditional build-up over many months.\nThe 1997 Grand National was restaged as a standalone event two days later, in front of around 20,000 spectators, after it was postponed from its traditional Saturday slot following a bomb scare at the course.\nEven that required immense effort, however, and a two-day delay when much infrastructure was already in place is different to a move to an as yet unspecified date in the autumn when restrictions on large gatherings could still be in place. The National is also the ultimate target for many horses at the outset of the jumps campaign and a shift to the opening weeks of the season could have knock-on effects on top-level National Hunt racing at other tracks for months afterwards.\nAs is the case for so many businesses, lost revenue will not be retrieved when the lockdown ends and it could be months, or even years, before the economy recovers from the effects of the current lockdown. The one cause for optimism, however, as racing counts the cost of losing the entire Grand National meeting for the first time since 1945, is that Tiger Roll, the race winner in 2018 and 2019, is expected to return in 2021 to attempt a third success.",

These are far from normal times, however, and in the past week football became political even though its practitioners are now self-isolating and invisible. Season suspended or not, Premier League players rounded on by a health secretary struggling to equip his own nurses know exactly how it feels to get a public kicking.\nThere are, of course, wealthier institutions around the country than football clubs, and many millionaires and corporations that pay less tax. But even when out of sight, the recipients of the stratospheric salaries common in the Premier League \u2013 and to a lesser but still significant extent in the EFL \u2013 are clearly too obvious a target to be ignored when the rest of the population is being asked to make sacrifices.\nDifficult as it is to defend the amounts of money leading players are paid \u2013 it should not take a national emergency to make anyone wonder whether \u00a3200,000 a week might be on the generous side for anyone not involved in life-and-death situations \u2013 the country as a whole is suffering through a lack of leadership, knowledge and foresight at the moment and football is no different. As Gary Lineker bravely pointed out, though the scorn Tottenham and Newcastle attracted by cutting the wages of their non-playing staff while protecting the incomes of players was completely justified, it was a decision that came from the boardroom rather than the dressing room.\nSelf-inflicted public relations damage does not get much more glaring, yet it was the players who bore the brunt of the resentment, not the billionaire owners. The players could do with someone to speak up for them on these occasions, someone to orchestrate a little positive PR, and not necessarily Gordon Taylor and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, which like most trade unions is principally concerned with making sure the employers are not getting away with anything they shouldn\u2019t.\nForcing pay cuts on the players, for instance, does not automatically free up money for the groundstaff or the caterers, much less for frontline health workers. It merely leaves more in the club account for directors to decide how to disburse.\nThe PFA stance has been to wait until it is possible for everyone to make concessions and move forward together, which sounds reasonable, except it seemed to prevent English clubs following the lead set by Barcelona and Juventus, among others, where pay cuts of up to 70% have already been agreed.\nThe understanding from the rest of Europe is that most players were quite happy to forgo large proportions of large salaries at a time when they are not in action and the rest of the country is struggling.\nThe likelihood is that players here feel the same. In fact there is already plenty of evidence through initiatives from Jordan Henderson, Harry Maguire and others that footballers were trying to make a contribution before Matt Hancock\u2019s suggestion they needed to play their part.\nIt is not quite the case that their union was holding them back by insisting on full payment of contracts, though the PFA was painfully slow in coming out and saying what it might do to help, leaving Crystal Palace\u2019s Andros Townsend to voice the concern that players were being portrayed as villains.\nEven as Premier League clubs voted to send financial assistance to the EFL, the National League and the NHS on Friday, there was a sense of having to be seen to be doing the right thing after too many days of failing to come up with anything constructive.\nIf, as expected, the players\u2019 representatives agree in principle to the conditional cuts or deferrals of up to 30% being proposed, it will at least allow the national game a fig leaf of respect and ought to forestall any threat of windfall taxation, though the cynical argument that football only reacted once a gun was held to its head will still have some validity \u2013 that is the way it looks.\nIt would have been better to have the conversation about voluntary deferrals or charitable donations at the outset, as soon as it became clear players would be taking an extended break from their normal working pattern. As some of the wealthiest and most visible members of society it was inevitable and foreseeable that footballers might attract envy when many are suffering financial hardship, yet some of what we have seen was closer to scapegoating.\nLaudable though Henderson\u2019s intentions undoubtedly are, and useful as his network of captains might prove, it is a pity players\u2019 efforts will now be viewed as reactions to bad publicity when there was plenty of time and opportunity for such high-profile figures to be more proactive. Fingers can be pointed at the union or the owners but the game as a whole needs to take stock at this point.\nFootballers were already earning too much money before the game went into hibernation, it was only natural that their income would attract attention, and though some clubs did the honourable thing by their casual and matchday staff, a few others handled a delicate situation clumsily.\nLessons need to be learned for next time, though goodness knows it is to be hoped there is no next time. To give everyone from the government down a break from accusations of complacency or ineptitude, no one knew in advance how to work through something on this scale.\nMistakes were and are being made at every level, and the mistake we might still all be making is to assume that at the end of this period of unnatural quiet, a referee\u2019s whistle will sound, the crowd will cheer and play will commence as usual.\nThat seems to be the picture Uefa has in mind, with a dogged insistence that all leagues and competitions must be concluded, but if the world has changed in the last couple of months football will have no option but to change with it.",

Either we respond with unwavering solidarity or our union fails, writes the Spanish prime minister\nEurope is enduring its worst crisis since the second world war. Our citizens are dying, or fighting for their lives in hospitals that are overwhelmed by a pandemic which represents the greatest threat to public health since the 1918 flu pandemic.\nThe European Union is facing a different war from those we have successfully averted over the past 70 years: a war against an invisible enemy that is putting the future of the European project to the test.\nThe circumstances are exceptional and call for unwavering positions: either we rise to this challenge or we will fail as a union. We have reached a critical juncture at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, need real proof of commitment. We need unwavering solidarity.\nSolidarity between Europeans is a key principle of the EU treaties. And it is shown at times like this. Without solidarity there can be no cohesion, without cohesion there will be disaffection and the credibility of the European project will be severely damaged.\nWe welcome a number of significant measures that have been announced over the past few weeks, including the European Central Bank\u2019s new temporary emergency purchase programme and the European commission\u2019s SURE plan for those who have lost their jobs. But these measures are not enough on their own. We must go further.\nEurope must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery. It must start doing so as soon as possible with measures to support the public debt that many states, including Spain, are taking on. And it must continue to do so when this health emergency is over, to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies by mobilising significant resources through a plan we are calling the new Marshall plan and which will require the backing of all of the EU\u2019s common institutions.\nEurope was born out of the ashes of destruction and conflict. It learned the lessons of history and understood something very simple: if we don\u2019t all win, in the end, we all lose.\nWe can turn this crisis into an opportunity to rebuild a much stronger European Union. But to do so, we need to implement ambitious measures. If we continue to think small, we will fail.\nThe United States responded to the recession of 2008 with a stimulus package, while Europe responded with austerity. We all know the outcome. Today, when we are on the brink of a global economic crisis of an even greater magnitude than that of 2008, the US has implemented the greatest mobilisation of public resources in its history.\nIs Europe willing to be left behind?\nIt is time to break with old, national dogmas. We have entered a new era and we need new responses. Let us hold on to our positive values and reinvent the rest.\nIn the coming months, the EU member states will inevitably take on greater volumes of debt to deal with the consequences of what is not just a health crisis, but an economic and social crisis. That is why the response cannot be the same as that envisaged for asymmetric economic shocks, such as a financial or banking crisis in a single state or group of states. If the virus does not respect borders, then nor should financing mechanisms.\nProvided that it is universal and not subject to conditions, the European Stability Mechanism may be useful in the initial stages to inject liquidity into EU economies through a line of credit. But this is not going to be sufficient in the medium term.\nThe challenge we face is extraordinary and unprecedented. It calls for a single, united, radical and ambitious response to preserve our economic and social system and protect our citizens.\nThe Spanish have always protected and defended the European project. It is time for reciprocity. With us, with Italy and with each and every one of the 27 countries of the union.\nIt is time to act with solidarity in creating a new debt mutualisation mechanism, acting as a single bloc for the purchase of essential medical supplies, establishing coordinated cybersecurity strategies, and preparing a major emergency plan to ensure that the continent\u2019s recovery is rapid and robust.\nThis solidarity has to ensure that there are no gaps between north and south, that we leave no one behind.\nThese are very challenging times which require bold decisions. Millions of Europeans believe in the European Union. We must not abandon them. We must give them reasons to keep believing. And we must act now or never, because, right at this moment, Europe itself is at stake.\nPedro S\u00e1nchez is the prime minister of Spain",

Businessman Adrien Aumont, co-founder of the crowdfunding site KissKissBankBank and novelist C\u00e9cile Ladjali also feature in the series along with Jo\u00ebl Boura\u00efma, a sports coach for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\u201cAnything is possible, that\u2019s the message we\u2019re trying to get across \u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean anything is easy,\u201d Boura\u00efma said. \u201cOf course, part of it is luck, but more important is work and determination, that\u2019s how the celebrities we feature on the programme succeeded.\u201d\nC\u00e9cile Ladjali added: \u201cI\u2019m a former dunce and I was told I\u2019d be a sales person in a clothes shop \u2026 in the end I have a doctorate, I\u2019m a novelist and also a professor.\u201d\nIn his 2010 book, On Ach\u00e8ve bien les \u00c9coliers (They Shoot School Kids, Don\u2019t They?) author Peter Gumbel asks: \u201cWhy is France the only country in the world that discourages children because of what they cannot do, rather than encouraging them to do what they can?\u201d\n\u201cThe whole French hierarchy, political and business, is predicated on people who have done well at school and who go on to the grandes \u00e9coles. More than anywhere else, it is the bac that is going to determine what your career choices are. It\u2019s very difficult to make a success of life in France if you don\u2019t have it,\u201d Gumbel told The Guardian.\n\u201cThe marking system is not designed to encourage students or improve their work, it about competing. How you do at school follows you for life and it\u2019s very hard to break away from that. If you don\u2019t have the bac you\u2019re considered on the heap.\u201d\nThe students in the first Les Cancres included Lucille who failed to turn up for her baccalaur\u00e9at exam.\n\u201cMy mother cried and said I\u2019d finish up in a soup kitchen or the job centre\u201d. Lucille said. She has now changed schools and is hoping to take the exam.\nNicolas Cennac, the documentary producer said the aim of Les Cancres was to \u201crepresent people who have a different experience at school but who have enormous gifts\u201d. He said his aim was to avoid stigmatising the pupils while at the same time not \u201cglamourising\u201d failure.\nAmong leading French personalities who have succeeded without passing their baccalaur\u00e9at are actors Catherine Deneuve and G\u00e9rard Depardieu, singer Vanessa Paradis, billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, president of the luxury group Kering, fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and multiple Michelin starred chef Alain Ducasse. Emile Zola failed the exam twice.\nOn Friday, the French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, announced that for the first time the baccaluar\u00e9at exams would not take place this year but pupils would be awarded the diploma on the basis of \u201ccontinued evaluation\u201d of their work at school. It is the first time the exam that was created in 1808 and has been sat every year since, even through the Nazi occupation, has been cancelled. French pupils are being expected to follow a full programme of online classes during the closures.\nGumbel said the French education minister was \u201cin a tight corner\u201d because the French system was not adapted to home working.\n\u201cIn France teaching methods don\u2019t lend themselves well to being done online.

These are the main stories on Sunday 5 April.\nThe NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, confirmed on Sunday that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle that will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator.\n\u201cThere is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,\u201d Fuller says. There\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d\nThree of the four latest deaths in NSW were passengers on the Ruby Princess.\nHealth authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak but have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early.\nAustralia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. Australia\u2019s death toll now stands at 34.\n\u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve,\u201d Murphy said.\nThe government has opened the door to allowing more of the casual workforce to access wage subsidies, as it vowed to press ahead with legislating the $130bn jobkeeper scheme this week.\nChristian Porter, the attorney general, said the government was aiming to be \u201cas inclusive and reasonable as possible\u201d on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending \u2013 to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight. The secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, said the union movement had been raising concerns publicly and privately with the government.\nThe WA premier, Mark McGowan, has told people outside the state to \u201ccome home by midnight tonight\u201d before strict new entry rules come into effect.\n\u201cNo one from over east will be allowed entry into Western Australia unless you\u2019re an approved exempt traveller \u2026 People can go to the government website to get the latest information and download the necessary forms. Checks will be occurring. If you\u2019ve lied on an exemption form to get into our state, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll get caught and be forced to face the consequences.\u201d\nVictoria\u2019s frontline health workers will have free hotel stays if they need to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisis, as the state recorded 20 new cases overnight.\nThe state government will provide $20m to buy hotel rooms, enabling up to 8,000 frontline workers who may test positive for Covid-19 or have unexpected and unprotected contact with a suspected patient, to self-isolate, away from family and flatmates, at no cost. The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients.\nAuthorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, was asked if police will be doing random checks on IDs to see that people have not gone on holidays and responded, \u201cwe will be stopping people and if you don\u2019t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine.\u201d Tasmania will toughen restrictions to stop people heading to their holiday homes or taking boating trips over the Easter break, the state\u2019s premier said on Sunday. Peter Gutwein said many elderly people lived in these areas, and they needed to be protected, as the state\u2019s confirmed cases rose to 82.\nPolice issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night where people were flouting social distancing directives. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was \u201cinexcusable\u201d.\n\u201cThis is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated.\u201d\nA man was also charged in Tasmania for allegedly disobeying isolation requirements after returning to the state from Victoria, police said.

        "content": "Ahmed fled Syria only to end up in the Malakasa refugee camp, where more than 1,000 people are being denied basic human rights\nWhen Ahmed landed in darkness on the Greek island of Lesbos he was convinced that the road ahead could not be as hard as the one he had just travelled.\nBut, instead of the volunteers and blankets that have met hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers before him, he was greeted by a jeering crowd of locals and had to be rescued by police. \u201cIt was the worst feeling I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that my dream of Greece was a false one.\u201d\nAhmed was among the more than 2,000 refugees who have arrived in Greece since the beginning of March, when the country suspended all access to asylum.\nTheir experiences, from seeing their children drowned at sea to being attacked by angry islanders, separated from family and dumped in remote detention camps, offer a month-long, nightmarish vision of what Europe would look like with no asylum rights.\nGreece shut off access after Turkey opened its borders in February and encouraged refugees to cross in a bid to pressure the European Union for more aid money in support of its military involvement against Russia and the Assad regime over the Syrian enclave of Idlib.\nBorn in Syria\u2019s capital, Damascus, Ahmed fled his home to escape military service with the regime. The 30-year-old told his story from inside the Malakasa detention camp in central Greece.\nHe spent the past four years in Turkey, where he met and married his wife, Hanin. Their precarious life and their wedding were documented in a Guardian photo essay last year.\nBut the couple were unable to make ends meet and Hanin, by now pregnant, made the journey by dinghy to Lesbos six months ago, with Ahmed promising to follow. She arrived safely and gave birth to their daughter, who is now two months old. Ahmed has yet to meet his child.\nHis first week on Lesbos was spent camping in a fenced-off area of the port city of Mytilene before he was shipped off, along with 450 other new arrivals, on a Greek navy vessel.\nAmelia Cooper, a case worker at the Lesbos Legal Centre who spoke to some of those detained at the port, said: \u201cThe suspension of the right to seek asylum was followed by deliberate attempts to isolate new arrivals and prevent their access to lawyers, journalists and members of the European parliament.\u201d\nIn the middle of last month, Greek authorities began work on two sites, one in Malakasa, where 1,340 people have been sent, and another near the border with Bulgaria in Serres, which is housing 600 people. A video of Malakasa shows white tents behind a chainlink fence topped with razor wire. A Greek contractor who posted the video on 28 March, with construction work still going on, acts as narrator: \u201cThe money is flowing. These illegal strays are good business.\u201d\n\u201cThese sites are fundamentally different,\u201d said Belkis Wille from Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey are open-air prisons, filled with people who have been denied their basic rights and are being held as de facto detainees without any legal framework.\u201d\nMost people in Malakasa and Serres are thought to be holding a deportation order from the Greek police. Refugees say they were forced to sign this Greek-language document despite being unable to read it. Under European law everyone is entitled to an individual assessment of their claim for protection but these documents declare that the accused must be deported for illegally entering Greece.\nFor the past four years, the larger flow of people across the eastern Aegean has been reduced by an arrangement between the EU and Ankara that saw Turkey get \u20ac6bn in aid in return for restricting crossings. Under this deal, Greece has returned 2,000 new arrivals. Since early March, Turkey has stated that even this deal is dead.\nAhmed said the uncertainty of the situation was unbearable: \u201cI lived through four years of war in Syria. This month is worse than those four years: can you imagine?\u201d\nConditions at the Serres site, where tents are packed tightly together behind fences on a dry riverbed, are even worse than at Malakasa. Detainees say they have no electricity to even charge a phone. The Serres police union said in a statement that the site was \u201ctotally unsuitable\u201d.\nSpyros Leonidas, mayor of the nearest village, Promaxonas, said the camp was \u201cunfit for animals, let alone people\u201d. \u201cThere are newborns and pregnant women among the people. And there is no hot water,\u201d he said.\nThe fate of those in detention remains unclear.\nThe Greek government has said that the suspension of asylum will be lifted , and the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said last week she had received assurances that those who arrived in March would be able to apply for asylum.\nHowever, Greece\u2019s migration and asylum minister, Notis Mitarakis, subsequently said that people who had been issued with deportation orders would not be granted an asylum process.\nNone of the detainees reached by the Observer had been notified of any change in their access to asylum. The Greek asylum service is closed until 10 April 10 because of the Covid-19 crisis.\nVassilis Papadopoulos, a lawyer and former senior official at the migration ministry under the previous government, said that Ahmed and the other detainees were \u201cbeing made an example of\u201d to show there was a tough new policy.\n\u201cWhat happened in March brought the numbers [of crossings] down so they\u2019re going to keep doing it, even if they say something different,\u201d he added.\nReporting for this article was supported by the Borders Newsroom at Lighthouse Reports",

        "content": "A doctor\u2019s harrowing account of the Spanish flu outbreak in London has valuable lessons for medical staff a century on\nIf predictions about the spread of Covid-19 are correct, the new NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel centre in London\u2019s Docklands could soon see a \u201ctsunami\u201d of coronavirus patients. Many will have pneumonia and require ventilators, which is why cubicles in the new 4,000-bed facility all have oxygen equipment.\nIt is to hoped this onslaught never comes and infections spread less rapidly than projections show. But if the worst happens, what can doctors and nurses expect?\nNHS workers could do worse than examine the experience of another London hospital during the Spanish influenza pandemic just over 100 years ago. Today, that hospital is named St Charles and offers walk-in care at the northern end of Ladbroke Grove, Kensington. But in 1918 it was known as St Marylebone Infirmary and had 744 beds for the \u201csick poor\u201d, many of whom had tuberculosis and other chronic lung conditions.\nIn October 1918, as a second wave of Spanish influenza spread across Britain, its wards were inundated with pneumonia cases. According to the infirmary\u2019s medical superintendent, Basil Hood, the hospital \u201cliterally reeled\u201d. Hood\u2019s harrowing frontline account is the centerpiece of an online exhibition and animation created by created by Viralanimation for London\u2019s Florence Nightingale Museum (temporarily closed).\n\u201cAll training, and indeed every sort of trimming, went by the board,\u201d Hood recalled in his notebook 30 years later. \u201cThe staff fought like Trojans to feed the patients, scramble as best they could through the most elementary nursing and keep the delirious in bed!\u201d\nIn normal circumstances, St Marylebone Infirmary ought to have been able to cope, but 1918 was not a normal time: by November, when the first world war came to an end, around half of the hospital\u2019s nurses had been called to military service. Having been decorated for bravery under fire, many nurses now fell victim to influenza.\n\u201cEach day the difficulties became more pronounced as the patients increased and the nurses decreased, going down like ninepins themselves,\u201d Hood wrote. \u201cSad to relate some of these gallant girls lost their lives in this never-to-be-forgotten scourge and as I write I can see some of them now literally fighting to save their friends then going down and dying themselves.\u201d\nHood made the nurses wear lint masks and advised them \u201cnot to interpose their faces too near the blast of those coughing\u201d. But when it came to tending to a fellow nurse, many refused to wear the masks for fear of distressing their colleague.\nIn the case of one nurse, Hood noted: \u201cNothing I could do or say had the slightest effect in influencing her to diminish the risks to herself. She was consumed with a burning desire to save her \u2026 inevitably, the nurse developed a lung infection, dying soon after the woman she had been nursing.\u201d\nBy December, Hood was exhausted and went on sick leave. When he returned in February, the epidemic was still raging and two more nurses had died, bringing the fatalities to nine.\n\u201cOne poor nurse, I remember, with a terribly acute influenzal pneumonia, became so distressed she could not stay in bed and insisted on being propped up against the wall by her bed until she was finally drowned in her profuse, thin blood-stained sputum.\u201d\nRevisiting his notes in retirement, Hood called the epidemic \u201cthe worst and most distressing occurrence of my professional life\u201d. In all, the hospital had admitted 850 influenza patients. In an era before vaccines and antibiotics, nearly half had developed pneumonia, many due to secondary bacterial infections, and 197 had died. By the time the pandemic ended in April 1919, 250,000 Britons had perished.\nOf course, coronavirus is a very different pathogen from influenza. Unlike the Spanish flu, which was most threatening to adults aged 20 to 40, Covid-19 is most deadly for over-70s and those with underlying medical conditions.\nAnother consideration is that in 1918 almost everyone had been exposed to some type of flu before, so many people had a degree of immunity. The Spanish flu infected just a third of the world\u2019s population. By contrast, no one had immunity to the new coronavirus, which is why it is estimated that 80% of the British population could be infected by the time the pandemic is over.\nWriting shortly after the establishment of the NHS in 1948, Hood worried that despite the arrival of vaccines and new drugs such as penicillin, the hospital system would struggle to cope with a virus as destructive as Spanish flu. \u201cOur helplessness now,\u201d Hood wrote, \u201cwould be nearly as great.\u201d\nBut that was then. At the ExCel centre, contractors have been working night and day to fit out the NHS Nightingale hospital. More field hospitals are planned at the NEC in Birmingham, the Principality stadium in Cardiff, the Manchester Central complex, the University of the West of England and the Harrogate convention centre.\nDoctors and nurses working at the Nightingale and other field hospitals will have modern personal protection equipment including, for use when intubating patients or performing bronchoscopies, FFP3 respirator masks, providing the highest available level of protection.\nFollowing the recent deaths of two British hospital consultants from Covid-19, it is to be hoped that \u2013 unlike the tragic nurse in 1918 \u2013 this time no one will choose not to use them.\nMark Honigsbaum is a medical historian and author of The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris",

        "content": "Thousands of casual workers at some of English football\u2019s biggest stadiums have been left unpaid during the Covid-19 shutdown, the Guardian understands.\nA number of employees from Delaware North \u2013 which provides catering and hospitality services at venues such as the Emirates Stadium, London Stadium, Wembley, Craven Cottage and the Ricoh Arena \u2013 have contacted the Guardian after seeing booked shifts cancelled and receiving no payments since the Premier League season halted last month.\nSome of the workers, who are on zero-hour or casual arrangements, feel increasingly desperate. The casual workers complain the company has told them there are no shifts for them because of the impact of Covid-19 and that it is trying to establish whether they are eligible to be furloughed under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme.\nThe situation puts Arsenal and West Ham at risk of embarrassment. Both clubs announced they would continue paying their casual employees as normal while fixtures are not taking place and there is no suggestion that this is not the case. But their statements left unclear the fact that a sizeable majority of casual work \u2013 also including cleaning and security-based jobs \u2013 at matches and other events is undertaken by workers from contracted companies who do not operate on the clubs\u2019 payrolls. Many Delaware North workers will be familiar faces to players, management and directors at both Premier League clubs, some of whom will know them as colleagues they see numerous times over the course of a season.\nA long-standing casual employee at one of the venues said they work there for up to five days a week but that income stream was removed as soon as the season was paused. They said they had received no payment for the shifts they had committed to.\nCasual workers were sent an email on Saturday, seen by the Guardian, in which Delaware North said it was awaiting \u201cdefinitive guidance\u201d on whether they were eligible to be furloughed and that the company would make it a priority to put them on that scheme if possible.\n\u201cWe are taking legal advice but until there is definitive guidance allowing you to undertake paid work for others whilst on furlough we will be maintaining this cautious stance,\u201d the email said. It added: \u201cIf you wish to work for another company at this time, think this is unfair, there is of course the option to ask to be P45\u2019d so that you can accept an offer of work elsewhere. You are always more than welcome to re-register with us when this is over.\u201d\nAccording to the government\u2019s scheme, casual staff who work variable hours and are paid by PAYE \u2013 which is understood to apply to most of Delaware North\u2019s workforce \u2013 may be eligible for the 80% wage guarantee, with their previous pay acting as a benchmark for furlough pay. At the highest end of the scale, zero-hour employees who in effect work full-time at Delaware North could stand to lose the government maximum contribution of \u00a32,500 a month if not furloughed.\nThere is little other work available in a hospitality industry that has been ravaged by the Covid-19 crisis and there are also suggestions that some have had trouble applying for universal credit due to a lack of certainty about their status. Delaware North\u2019s casual workforce encompasses a wide range of personal circumstances. For some it is a sole source of income, whereas others have a second job.\nSome of Delaware North\u2019s peers have openly taken steps to help some of their workers. A spokesperson acting on behalf of Compass, which supplies hospitality staff to Tottenham, said that regular workers \u2013 which Compass considers to denote those who have worked at least 40 hours over the past four months \u2013 are being paid their wages in full for the first two weeks of the shutdown, with 80% thereafter in line with the government scheme.\nDelaware North is yet to respond to a number of emails and phone messages. When asked whether it might be fruitful for a club to pressurise a contractor to remunerate their staff, Arsenal and West Ham both pointed out that the issue was separate to the clubs. The Guardian understands that Arsenal are in regular liaison with Delaware North.",

        "content": "Experts are watching carefully to see if this virus will follow the seasonal pattern of flu, but warn differences may be minor\nBalmy days are coming, with temperatures forecast to reach 20C in some regions. The warm weather will bring welcome respite to lockdown Britain - and put pressure on authorities trying to control crowds and gatherings.\nHowever, scientists also believe warm weather could bring new insights into the virus by showing whether it reacts to the onset of spring. Flu epidemics tend to die out as winter ends; could sunshine, similarly, affect the behaviour of the coronavirus and its spread? It is a key question, and epidemiologists will be watching for changes very closely.\nInitial studies of other coronaviruses - the common varieties that cause colds in the UK - do suggest a seasonal pattern, with peaks occurring during winter and disappearing in spring. Intriguingly, these peaks tend to coincide with flu outbreaks. By contrast, only small amounts of coronavirus appear to be transmitted in the summer.\nA key study of the common coronaviruses - HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E - was published last week by scientists at University College London. By analysing samples collected several years ago they found high rates of coronavirus infections in February, while in summer they were very low. Other studies have also shown coronaviruses are seasonal in behaviour in temperate climates.\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Rob Aldridge, sounded a note of caution, however. \u201cWe could see continued but lower levels of coronavirus transmission in summer but this may reverse in the winter if there is still a large susceptible population at that point,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd given this is a novel virus, we don\u2019t know if a seasonal pattern will hold over the summer given high levels of susceptibility in the population. For this reason, it is crucial that we all act now to follow current health advice.\u201d\nThis point is backed stressed by other scientists, who warn that the Covid-19 virus is a completely new infectious agent and so there has been no chance for populations to build up any immunity. As a result, it is likely to continue to spread at current rates despite the onset of summer.\n\u201cI am sure seasonal variations in the virus\u2019s behaviour will play a role in its spread,\u201d said virologist Michael Skinner at Imperial College London. \u201cBut compared with the effect we are having with social distancing, it will be a very minor influence. It may produce some marginal effects but these will not be a substitute for self-isolation.\u201d\nBen Neuman of Reading University was more emphatic. \u201cThis virus started in near-freezing conditions in China, and is rapidly growing both in Iceland and on the equator in Brazil and Ecuador. As winter turned to spring, the virus growth has accelerated worldwide. This is not War of the Worlds, and there is no deus ex machina to reach out of the clouds and put this right. We have to beat the virus ourselves.\u201d\nThe arrival of spring does not only affect the behaviour of a virus, however. It also produces changes in the human immune system, other researchers point out. \u201cOur immune system displays a daily rhythm, but what is less known is how this varies from season to season,\u201d said immunologist Natalie Riddell at Surrey University.\nTo find out, Riddell and other researchers at Surrey and Columbia Universities have been studying immune changes in humans at different seasons and different times of day. Biological samples were taken from volunteers at the winter and summer solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes. Initial findings suggest a subset of white blood cells that play a key role in the immune system appear to be elevated at certain times of day, indicating that the system responds differently at varying times. For example, B cells that produce antibodies were found to be elevated at night.\nHowever, the impact of seasons on cell rhythms is still under investigation, added the study\u2019s leader, Micaela Martinez of Columbia University. Results would be of considerable importance, she added. \u201cKnowing the vulnerabilities of our body to diseases and viruses across the year could inform the timing of vaccination campaigns that will help us eradicate infections.\u201d",

He went to work on his bicycle, he was polite with my staff and me and he posed absolutely no problem in our community,\u201d Ferlay said.\nThe local newspaper, the Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, said the man had been working in a factory at Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re, a town of 33,000 residents, and was unknown to French and European police and the security services.\nA statement from the counter-terrorism prosecutor\u2019s officer said a search of the suspect\u2019s apartment had uncovered \u201chandwritten documents with religious connotations\u201d. It said the as yet unidentified author of the documents \u201ccomplains in particular that he lives in a country of sinners\u201d.\nThe suspect entered a tobacconist shop on Saturday morning and allegedly attacked the owner and injured the shopkeeper\u2019s wife when she tried to help her husband. He then went to a nearby butcher\u2019s where witnesses said he jumped over the counter, grabbed another knife and stabbed a customer before running out and attacking passersby in the street.\nA computer engineer aged 44 was killed while inside the butcher\u2019s shop. The second casualty, named as Julien Vinson, 55, the owner of La Charrette, a cafe theatre, was stabbed in the street while trying to protect his 12-year-old son.\nA third man, aged 63, was in a serious condition in hospital and four other people \u2013 two men, 65 and 59, and two women, 48 and 49 \u2013 were also injured.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the attack as \u201can odious act that has brought grief to a country already sorely tested in recent weeks\u201d.\nThe interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who travelled to Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re after the attack, referred to the suspect\u2019s \u201cterrorist background\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cI commend the full engagement of the security forces who quickly apprehended the suspect and who are now carrying out the investigation.\u201d",

We are asking the Department for Education to guarantee and underwrite the full costs of providing FSM [free school meals] during the Easter holidays to all eligible children.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe rapid closure of schools and social distancing measures means families are not well prepared for the Easter break, will have increased difficulty in managing their children and young people and be more vulnerable to the impact of food poverty.\u201d\nBlake, who is also chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, said: \u201cNo young person should have to go hungry, and ensuring vulnerable pupils \u2013 including those on free school meals \u2013 are provided for is a top priority for councils and schools.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s recent announcement that families of children entitled to free school meals will be eligible for food vouchers is positive news but we remain concerned that the scheme does not cover school holidays.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cPupils in receipt of free school meals are not usually entitled to them over the school holidays, but with almost a million more families now finding themselves in financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, schools are stepping up to fill the gap in provision to ensure no young person goes hungry.\n\u201cCouncils are doing everything in their power to put in place local arrangements, but without these costs being covered by the government schools will have to find these resources from elsewhere, such as local food banks.\u201d\nJulie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe cost of funding free school meals over the Easter holidays would be relatively modest compared to the billions of pounds which are being rightly injected into the economy at present.\u201d\nThe Labour-led Welsh government is the only one of the four UK administrations that has pledged to fund free meals over the two-week holiday.\nThe Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said: \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever, in these difficult times, that we make sure everyone who needs that extra bit of support continues to receive it.\u201d\nDominic Cools-Lartigue, the founder of A Plate For London, who will be helping to feed young people in Tower Hamlets, east London, over Easter, criticised the government\u2019s position and said: \u201cWe can\u2019t sit around waiting for the government to realise that children\u2019s hunger won\u2019t go away during the holidays.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s guidance makes it clear that it will be up to councils to fund free school meals in the holidays. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cOur focus is making sure that the 1.3 million disadvantaged children who would normally have a free school meal on a school day do not go hungry as a result of staying home.\u201d",

        "content": "Even as Covid-19 cases ballooned, Governor Ron DeSantis waited until Wednesday to order Florida residents to stay at home\nIn the skies above southern Florida, Ron DeSantis, the state\u2019s governor and self-confessed Donald Trump disciple (and often referred to as a \u201cmini-Trump\u201d), was mulling the morning\u2019s developments as he gazed from the airplane window. Returning to Tallahassee after visiting a coronavirus testing site in Miami and issuing a regional stay-at-home order for the state\u2019s four southernmost counties, he was preparing notes for an upcoming press conference and doubtless thinking about the birth of his third child.\nThe beaches below him were not packed, as in the enduring images that will come to epitomize his lethargic response to the pandemic, but there were enough people milling about to alarm the elected leader of the only one of the \u201chotspot\u201d states \u2013 those with Covid-19 cases at that stage in excess of 5,000 \u2013 not to have imposed blanket stay-at-home restrictions.\n\u201cWere there people out there? Damn right there were,\u201d DeSantis said of his observations at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, one day after his Miami visit.\n\u201cNo matter what you do, you\u2019re going to have a class of folks who just do whatever the hell they want to. Not everyone believes they need to govern themselves accordingly.\u201d\nThe scenes on the beaches had clearly resonated with the governor. On Wednesday, before another 24 hours had passed, DeSantis finally issued the statewide shelter-in-place order for Florida\u2019s population of 21 million \u2013 one in five of whom are older than 65 \u2013 that health officials, scientists and political opponents had been pleading with him to sign for more than two weeks.\nDuring that time, as the number of cases and fatalities grew, Florida\u2019s beaches remained open, thousands flocked to church services (in defiance of local rules) and carefree seniors in the country\u2019s fastest-growing retirement hub, The Villages, did what they always do: play golf.\nOffshore, cruise ships stricken with dead or infected crew and passengers waited, unsure if they would be allowed to dock.\nMeanwhile, DeSantis appeared to fiddle while Florida burned. He pressed ahead with his patchwork management of the crisis: a partial closure in some areas, interstate roadblocks to deter visitors, asking bars and restaurants to shutter, but mostly allowing cities and counties to set their own rules. Even after issuing Monday\u2019s unified order affecting Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, the governor conceded it contained little that was new. \u201cI just came in and made them all one unit so everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said.\nTo nobody\u2019s surprise, DeSantis was taking a leaf straight from the Trump playbook by prioritizing the economy, and listening to advice from the Florida chamber of commerce, Associated Industries of Florida and the state\u2019s restaurant and lodging association over that of public health officials warning of a coming disease tsunami, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\nIt was all, in the words of Oscar Braynon, a state senator from Miami Gardens, \u201cthe dumbest shit I have heard in a long time\u201d.\nThat Florida\u2019s governor has been in lockstep with the messaging and posturing from the White House at every step of the pandemic, up to and including this week\u2019s abrupt volte-face, was a given, at least to those who have followed the former US congressman\u2019s career in Tallahassee.\nDeSantis \u2013 hailed from the Rose Garden lectern as \u201ca great governor who knows exactly what he is doing\u201d \u2013 consults with Trump regularly and the two share a similar ideology.\nAs Trump frequently and controversially called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, DeSantis was also castigating outsiders, blaming New Yorkers for \u201cseeding\u201d the spread in Florida and dispatching the national guard to airports to intercept them. When the president mooted plans to classify counties by risk level, then last weekend floated the idea of a quarantine for New York, DeSantis gave his full support.\nAnd as the pressure built this week for a statewide stay-at-home edict, DeSantis admitted he would be taking his orders directly from Washington DC. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re recommending we\u2019ll go ahead and do that,\u201d he said at the Tuesday press briefing. \u201cIf any of those taskforce folks tell me we should do X, Y or Z, then of course we\u2019re going to consider, but nobody has said that to me thus far.\u201d\nThe instruction duly came on Wednesday morning, in the form of an appearance on NBC\u2019s Today program by Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general. Asked about DeSantis\u2019s prevarication, Adams responded by quoting Trump\u2019s extension of social distancing measures the night before: \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order.\u201d\nThe message was unmistakable. Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, Florida executive order 20-91 was published. DeSantis said on Thursday on Fox News that the U-turn \u201cwas the right thing to do\u201d because of the Trump extension.\n\u201cWe have a governor who does not believe he serves the people of Florida but rather kowtows to the president of the United States,\u201d Donna Shalala, a congressional representative for Miami who was the US secretary of health during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, told reporters on Thursday morning.\nThe delay in publishing the order, she added, had been a critical miscalculation. \u201cHe hesitated and hesitated and hesitated. He has put us in a dangerous situation. Numerous people will die because our governor hesitated,\u201d she said.\nThe question now is what consequence the order will have, and whether it has come too late to significantly alter experts\u2019 predictions of a spike in deaths in Florida. On Thursday the University of Washington\u2019s institute for health was still predicting cases in the state would crest in early May, but increased its projected peak daily death toll from 136 to 175, a rate that would lead to about 7,000 deaths by mid-June.\n\u201cWe are trying to plan for a tsunami on the horizon that everybody is hoping is going to miss our island but is bearing straight down on us,\u201d said Dr Kayser Enneking, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida\u2019s department of medicine.\n\u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments has been based not on science but the gut of our leaders. The number of cases in Florida is on the exponential rise, but the lack of testing has impacted our ability to predict where we are in this crisis.\u201d\nThe picture is also muddled over the medical supplies and equipment Florida says it will need. Last Sunday, Trump insisted that the state\u2019s wishlist, including 5,000 ventilators, half a million each of gloves and gowns, and 2m N95 face masks, had been met from federal supplies. \u201cFlorida has been taken care of,\u201d the president promised. \u201cI looked, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things done and they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d\nBut by the following afternoon Jared Moskowitz, appointed by DeSantis as Florida\u2019s director of emergency management last year, had resorted to Twitter, frustrated by failed efforts to bring more masks to the state and lamenting a lack of a federal allocation system.\n\u201cIt feels like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he wrote, referring to the third-party distribution scheme for equipment manufactured by 3M. \u201cDifferent distributors represented by brokers selling the same lot of masks bidding against each other. I\u2019m chasing ghosts here.\u201d\nAs for testing, Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, told Slate she believed the state was \u201cwoefully underprepared\u201d.\n\u201cIn Hillsborough county, we received just 900 collection kits over a week ago. We went through those in two days. We just received another thousand, and we\u2019ll get through those in two days as well,\u201d she said.\nShe was, however, reluctant to place the blame solely on DeSantis: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time this governor\u2019s been through it. What a hell of a test this is.\u201d\nGeorge Moraitis, chair of Broward county\u2019s Republican party, was even more generous. \u201cGovernor DeSantis is under the microscope but he\u2019s excelling,\u201d he wrote in a Sun-Sentinel op-ed. \u201cHe is leading Florida through the Covid-19 outbreak with measured, informed and effective actions to protect both the health and the fundamental rights of all Floridians.\u201d\nEvan Jenne, co-leader elect of Florida\u2019s House Democrats, told the Guardian that further down the line he would call for a legislative select committee to evaluate the actions of DeSantis and his administration throughout the crisis.\n\u201cWe need to know what went right and what went wrong. I have a feeling that both of those will be long lists,\u201d he said. DeSantis\u2019s decree, however, will appear firmly in the second category, in Jenne\u2019s view, not least because it exempts churches and places of worship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an executive order with holes big enough you could drive an 18-wheeler through it. Mass meetings of worshipping folks are perfectly fine, and that\u2019s not going to help,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAt no point in our nation\u2019s history has human sacrifice ever been an acceptable form of worship and you\u2019re potentially going to kill someone, if not put them through respiratory hell. It\u2019s not strict enough in any way, shape or form.\u201d",

It ends a century later with a contemporary couple whose lives circle back to the same village hall.\nMargaret is a prickly unmarried woman who has lost everything to the war, including her brother, William. Grace is a charming bohemian who served on the front with William and has sought Margaret out to bury the dead man\u2019s few remaining possessions under a tree, as instructed in the event of his death.\nThe plot initially seems to be about secrets the dead leave behind that posthumously reveal double lives. William was a star of the Immoral Balmorals, a theatre company that entertained troops on the frontlines while fighting alongside them, Grace tells Margaret. What\u2019s more, Grace was in love with him. \u201cAren\u2019t you\u2019re a man?\u201d asks Margaret accusingly. Grace \u2013 wearing a white dress, pearls and a face net \u2013 is a man. As Margaret\u2019s guard is lowered, though, she accepts the love between her dead brother and his beguiling lover.\nDeirdre Kinahan\u2019s play turns out to be an unexpected and touching drama about unlikely friendships, post-war homosexuality and the cost of war for women.\nIt is also fitting that this co-production by Pentabus and New Perspectives revolves around a village hall; Pentabus is dedicated to telling rural stories and tours plays about the countryside to fields, theatres and local halls. Crossings is the second work in a three-month long initiative to release one production every week online, free of charge. The first was Matt Hartley\u2019s Here I Belong, also set in a village hall; Hattie Naylor\u2019s As the Crow Flies is due to be available from 10 April.\nThe second part of the play turns its focus to the contemporary characters Sean, who is Margaret\u2019s grandson, and Mirjana, a care worker originally from Sarajevo. Their characterisation is flatter and less affecting, and the central parallel made between their lives in 2019 and those of the 1919 couple is strained.\nBut good writing and fine acting make up for such flaws. Victoria Brazier and Will O\u2019Connell, who double up for parts in both time frames, not only show versatility as actors but also have strong singing voices for the musical interludes. There are smooth switches through time in Sophie Motley\u2019s production and minimal props are used to good effect.\nFor all the unresolved grief of war, Crossings is also about the joy of song and dance and, at heart, it celebrates the consolations of theatre and performance.\n Crossings is available online through Pentabus.",

Europe was born out of the ashes of destruction and conflict. It learned the lessons of history and understood something very simple: if we don\u2019t all win, in the end, we all lose.\u201d\nHe reiterated his call for so-called \u201ccoronabonds\u201d, or EU-backed debt instruments, as well as a European Marshall plan of massive public investments.\nThere are signs that the coronavirus may be beginning to loosen its grip on Spain and Italy, Europe\u2019s hardest-hit countries in the pandemic.\nSpain reported 674 deaths in the past 24 hours, the lowest daily toll since 26 March. The virus has claimed 12,418 lives in the country, and the number of confirmed cases is now 130,759, according to data from the health ministry published on Sunday.\nThe latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to about 5% \u2013 the smallest increase since officials began tracking the outbreak.\nWhile officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted that the figures hinted at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care.\n\u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra from Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d\nIn Italy, the number of deaths has passed the 15,000 mark. The total rose on Saturday by 681, the lowest daily rise in almost two weeks.\nOfficials said on Saturday the number of patients in intensive care had fallen for the first time since they began tracking the outbreak, with 3,994 people in intensive care on Saturday, down from 4,068.\n\u201cThis is important news as it allows our hospitals to breathe,\u201d said Angelo Borrelli, the chief of the civil protection authority.\nIn Germany, the number of confirmed infections rose by 5,936 in 24 hours to a total of 91,714 on Sunday, the third consecutive day that the daily rate of new cases had dropped, data from the government\u2019s Robert Koch Institute showed.",

And I will talk to them about the refugees today living in terrible conditions in the camps of Greece and northern France. I think there are parallels to be made and the message is that as a country we can give people like that hope. It is the same hope that we can also give to those who are incarcerated too.\u201d\nDubs said he was impressed by the support that he and Humanists UK had received from the prison authorities.\n\u201cThey have been very keen to have us on Prison Radio as a means of boosting morale in these challenging times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been difficult for humanist pastors to reach many prisoners under this lockdown so this message and others to come from supporters of Humanists UK will hopefully make them feel that they are not completely alone.\u201d\nAs well as his audio message Dubs will read extracts of WH Auden\u2019s 1939 poem Refugee Blues. He has also chosen a song, the Irish ballad Danny Boy, which he said was one of his favourite pieces of music.\nAndrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, said other patrons of the organisation would broadcast messages during the next few weeks and months for humanist and atheist prisoners during the lockdown.\nHe said: \u201cFor prisoners, their circumstances are even more dire and it is vital that they receive the emotional and pastoral support they need. We hope our work in providing these humanist broadcasts will remind prisoners that we are thinking of them, and that they are not alone in perhaps having greater feelings of anxiety and loneliness \u2013 it is very human to feel this way right now.\n\u201cDuring the broadcasts we will also be reminding them of their legal rights to be provided with a humanist pastoral carer who can provide bereavement support and compassion from a like-minded person who understands their worldview.\u201d",

        "content": "Officials look to make U-turn on covering nose and mouth despite equipment shortages\nAuthorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst affected by coronavirus, have introduced a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside, while Spain is considering recommending the public wear masks.\nAs the number of confirmed infections globally passed the 1.2m mark officials around the world appeared to be making a U-turn on whether the public should wear masks, despite huge shortages.\nThe calls came as a senior US health official braced the country for a coming week of deaths that would rival \u201c9/11 or Pearl Harbor\u201d in their impact on the nation\u2019s psyche.\nUS surgeon general Jerome Adams warned: \u201cThis is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans lives, quite frankly.\n\u201cThis is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it\u2019s not going to be localised \u2026 It\u2019s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.\u201d\nSpain was mulling the new recommendation on masks as the country reported 674 new deaths from coronavirus, 135 fewer than in the previous 24 hours and its lowest number in 10 days. Infections rose by 5%, the smallest increase since the epidemic hit.\nItaly also saw a significant decline in both deaths and the rate of increase of new cases on Sunday. The 525 new coronavirus deaths announced were the lowest in the last two weeks, and well down from the record high of 969 on 27 March.\nThe number of new confirmed cases increased by 2,972, a 3.3% rise compared to Saturday, but almost half the number of new cases recorded on 20 March.\nPreviously, countries had followed international health recommendations that suggested masks offered little protection and if not regularly replaced could increase the risk of infection.\nMore recently, however, following the example in some Asian countries, some experts have suggested that covering the nose and mouth may be useful in stopping the spread of the disease.\nLombardy\u2019s president, Attilio Fontana, announcing the new law there, said people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses\u201d with a simple scarf, saying it would help \u201cprevent you from spreading the virus if you happen to be a carrier\u201d.\nImages from cities including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days in the good weather. The Lombardy law will be in place at least until 13 April, when Italy\u2019s lockdown is due to expire.\nOn Friday Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, suggested the government would \u201cprobably\u201d recommend the wearing of masks, though in many places they are almost impossible to find.\nProtective masks \u2013 both the specialised air-tight versions required by healthcare workers and the more basic surgical versions \u2013 are in desperately short supply around the globe and have become the subject of bidding wars between countries. China is the world\u2019s largest supplier.\nThe scramble for desperately needed medical equipment and protective gear has been most marked in the US, where it is causing intense squabbling between the states and federal government just as the nation is facing one of its gravest emergencies.\nIn New York, the worst hit state, governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference on Sunday that there had been 594 coronavirus deaths in New York state in the last day for a total of 4,159, but deaths had gone down from 630 a day prior.\n\u201cWe could be either very near the apex or the apex could be a plateau and we could be on that plateau right now. We won\u2019t know until you see the next few days,\u201d he said.\nAt a time when Christians would normally be celebrating Palm Sunday, the pandemic continued to disrupt traditional observances. Pope Francis marked the day in St Peter\u2019s Square without congregants, while in China grave-cleaning ceremonies were severely restricted.\nItaly and Spain each expressed hope that their crises were peaking, though Italian officials said the emergency was far from over.\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, the reported global death toll neared 65,000 as outbreaks of the disease continued to flare up, including in Tokyo, which recorded a record daily increase in infections at 130.\nThe number of people infected in the US soared to more than 300,000 as deaths climbed past 8,500. Many of the victims are in New York City but the outbreak is deepening elsewhere too.\nGreece moved to quarantine a second migrant facility after a 53-year-old man tested positive, the migration ministry said on Sunday.\nThe Afghan man lives with his family at the Malakasa camp along with hundreds of other migrants and asylum seekers. On Thursday authorities quarantined the Ritsona camp in central Greece after 20 asylum seekers tested positive for coronavirus. It was the first such facility in the country to be hit since the outbreak of the disease.\nIn China the spread of the disease has largely subsided but officials have been cautious about reopening public spaces.",

The things we have seen are straight out of a horror film,\u201d a doctor at the Teodoro Maldonado Carbo hospital, one of the city\u2019s biggest facilities, told the Guardian. \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want me to go to work. But if I don\u2019t, more patients will die.\u201d\nOn Saturday Ecuador\u2019s health ministry said it had registered 172 Covid-19 deaths, 122 of them in Guayas province, of which Guayaquil is the capital. Low testing rates mean the true figure is almost certainly higher. Ecuador has officially registered 3,465 coronavirus cases, the third highest number in South America after Brazil and Chile.\nOne regional politician, Carlos Luis Morales, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that officials had been instructed not to divulge statistics about the death toll in Guayas. But he added: \u201cJust to give you an idea, 480 death certificates have been issued since yesterday; 150 bodies are being collected each day.\u201d\nEcuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, has said up to 3,500 people could die in Guayas in the coming weeks, while Guayaquil\u2019s city hall said on Saturday that it would hand out 2,000 cardboard coffins \u201cto offer a dignified burial to those who die during this health emergency\u201d.\nJorge Wated, the official leading Guayaquil\u2019s response to the crisis, announced a WhatsApp hotline for victims. \u201cAttention: those who require the removal of the deceased from their homes can write to us on this number,\u201d he tweeted.\nEcuador\u2019s government has faced criticism for its response to coronavirus and failure to effectively enforce a quarantine in Guayaquil as the infection spread.\n\u201cWhen the virus appeared in China, we thought it would never reach here,\u201d Morales told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cNow it\u2019s in all of us. We are breathing it. It\u2019s in the atmosphere.\u201d\nEcuador\u2019s vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner, offered a televised apology to the nation on Saturday for the gruesome images coming out of Guayaquil showing corpses dumped on pavements or outside homes.\n\u201cI give you my word that I am doing everything in my power to save the greatest number of lives possible,\u201d Sonnenholzner said. \u201cThis crisis isn\u2019t about left or right. Rich or poor. This virus doesn\u2019t care for religion, race or social status. All it seeks to do is spread. Its transmission risk is something never before seen by humanity.\u201d",

Fossil fuels made up less than 15% of electricity, of which only 1.1% came from coal plants.\nMeanwhile, the country\u2019s energy demand has fallen by around 10% due to the shutdown of pubs, restaurants, companies and factories across the country, leading to the lowest electricity market prices in 10 years.\nHouseholds on a new breed of home energy tariff will even be paid to use electricity during the day on Sunday, because sunny weather and a brisk breeze will help generate ample clean electricity to meet the UK\u2019s lower energy needs.\nThe so-called \u201cnegative electricity prices\u201d have previously only been available to homes overnight, when demand is typically at its lowest. But the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and the bright spring weather mean some homes will be able to earn money while using clean electricity during the day for the first time.\nHouseholds which use the Agile Octopus energy tariff, offered by Octopus Energy, were contacted on Saturday to let them know they would be paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity they use during the sunniest hours of Sunday afternoon.\nFrom 11am-4pm, those customers will earn 0.22p-3.3p per kWh to make use of the UK\u2019s abundant clean energy, the company said.\nThe coronavirus has caused the UK\u2019s demand for electricity to fall by between 9% and 13% so far, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. While home energy use is higher because people are self-isolating and working from home, the lockdown has led to a lower demand for electricity across the country due to the shutdown of \u201clarge electrical loads\u201d such as factories, shops and railways.\nEnergy bill savings are also likely for homes using variable energy tariffs, which track the wholesale energy markets.\nA slump in global gas market prices over the last year, combined with the lockdown, caused the wholesale price of electricity on the UK power markets to fall to \u00a328 per megawatt hour (MWh) last week. The electricity market price is down a third from January this year and well below the \u00a344/MWh price recorded this time last year.",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d\nIn an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d\nTrump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d.\nThe wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others.\nTrump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d\nBiden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d\nBiden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said Trump had dismantled.\n\u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving.\n\u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem.\n\u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d\nAppearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response.\n\u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019?\n\u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president. Show some leadership. Mobilize the industrial base of the United States, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d\nOn ABC, Biden also weighed in on the controversial dismissal of the US navy captain Brett Crozier, calling it \u201cclose to criminal\u201d.\nCapt Crozier was removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt this week after he wrote a memo about concerns for his crew on the aircraft carrier with coronavirus cases aboard. Capt Crozier was cheered from the ship but on Saturday Trump criticized him for writing the letter.\n\u201cI thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that\u2019s nuclear-powered.\u201d\nThe defense secretary, Mark Esper, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday \u201cthere is an investigation ongoing\u201d but repeated that he supported the decision to fire Crozier because Thomas Modly, the acting navy secretary, had lost confidence in him.\n\u201cWhen all those facts come to bear we\u2019ll have a chance to understand\u201d why the decision was taken, Esper said.\nEsper also dismissed reports that, as the Washington Post put it, Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d\nBiden said it was \u201cclose to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy. The idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his navy personnel were in danger \u2026 Look how many have the virus.\n\u201cI think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.\u201d\nEsper also appeared on ABC, where he said US military personnel would soon be required to wear masks on duty.",

Funding could come from government, levies on the banking or gambling sectors, or the National Lottery, the report said.\nSuch a scheme would mainly target lower-income earners who cannot afford to repay interest on loans of between \u00a3200 and \u00a32,000, although they would still have to repay the amount borrowed. The study found that more than 400,000 people in Britain would be eligible.\nThe report was published last month by its authors, the consultancy London Economics, but has not been published on the government\u2019s website despite being completed last year. A Treasury spokesman said the government would pilot the scheme, but declined to give a timetable or to say if it was considered by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, as a coronavirus relief measure.\nIn the past fortnight almost a million people have applied for universal credit, the main form of income support, despite large incentives for businesses to retain workers.\n\u201cIf there was ever a time to recognise the need to reform access to credit it is now,\u201d said the Labour MP Stella Creasy,who has campaigned against high-cost credit. \u201cThat the Treasury has evidence on how to do this makes the case even more compelling for action as it shows it\u2019s possible even when there isn\u2019t a financial crisis looming.\u201d\nPeter Tutton, the head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, said no-interest loans should be expedited, alongside the more flexible application of universal credit and help for community lenders and credit unions.\n\u201cWith nearly 10 million people already under financial pressure before the current crisis, it\u2019s vital to find better alternatives to high-cost credit that can spiral people into worse debt,\u201d he said.\nThe Treasury-commissioned study was an initiative kicked off by the former chancellor Philip Hammond in the 2018 budget in an attempt to stop payday lenders ripping off poorer customers.\nA Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe chancellor has announced an unprecedented package of support for workers and businesses.\u201d\nThe spokesman pointed to policies increasing universal credit and tax credit payments by \u00a37bn and said the government was \u201chelping the most vulnerable with their council tax bills through a \u00a3500m hardship fund\u201d.",

But content that is simply conspiratorial about 5G mobile communications networks, without mentioning coronavirus, is still allowed on the site.\nYouTube said those videos may be considered \u201cborderline content\u201d and subjected to suppression, including loss of advertising revenue and being removed from search results on the platform.\n\u201cWe also have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us,\u201d a YouTube spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe have also begun reducing recommendations of borderline content such as conspiracy theories related to 5G and coronavirus, that could misinform users in harmful ways.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s decision to reduce the visibility of content linked to the false theory came as Vodafone said that two of its own masts, and two it shares with O2, were targeted. Three other masts were subjected to arson attacks last week.\nNick Jeffery, Vodafone UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt beggars belief that some people should want to harm the very networks that are providing essential connectivity to the emergency services, the NHS and the rest of the country during this lockdown period.\u201d\nAmir Khan on Sunday became the latest celebrity to share the debunked theory on Sunday in a series of Instagram videos. The theory, which has been described as \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d by cabinet office minister Michael Gove, has also been promoted by Woody Harrelson and Amanda Holden.\nOne video, removed by the site after the Guardian flagged it, featured a man claiming to be a former executive at a UK mobile network falsely stating that coronavirus tests were actually used to spread the virus, and that the pandemic was created to hide deaths from the mobile technology.\nBut variations of the video have been available on the site for weeks, and shortly after it was taken down, the Guardian found another three versions of the same recording uploaded to different channels.\nIn a statement, Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, the global communications industry body, said: \u201cThe telecoms industry is working around the clock to keep vital health, education and emergency services online, businesses running, and friends and families connected. It is deplorable that critical communications infrastructure is being attacked based on outright mistruths. We urge everyone to trust health authorities and rest assured communications technology is safe. There is no link between 5G and Covid-19.\u201d\nYouTube says that since early February, it has manually reviewed and removed thousands of videos that spread dangerous or misleading coronavirus information. For other videos, it has applied its main tool for fighting the spread of misinformation: a text link that takes users to the NHS information page about Covid-19. That box was visible on some, but not all, of the videos flagged by the Guardian.\nThe World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.\nThe UN agency\u00a0advises\u00a0people to:\nMany countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on the UK community and look forward to continuing our work with the UK government and the NHS to keep the British public safe and informed during this difficult time,\u201d the YouTube spokesperson added.\nContent that spreads falsehoods about 5G but does not mention coronavirus is not in violation of the site\u2019s policies, YouTube says, but is often considered borderline content and is subjected to limited functionality, such as being removed from recommendations and search features on the platform. These actions reduce views on affected videos by more than 70%, it says.\nThe site\u2019s refusal to remove entirely misinformation about 5G may set it on a collision course with the UK government. On Sunday, the Observer reported that the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, is to hold talks with platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Twitter to \u201chammer home\u201d the message that spreading 5G misinformation is unacceptable.\nLast week, mobile phone masts in Birmingham, Merseyside and Belfast were set on fire and broadband engineers faced physical and verbal threats from people who believe that 5G signals are responsible for the global pandemic.",

He stepped back from day-to-day work at the firm when he became an MP in 2010 and quit his role as part-time adviser when he became a minister in 2019. He reportedly received a payout of about \u00a31m from the business last year.\nThe firm said assets in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia were cheap following the recent heavy falls in global stock markets. Asquith noted that in the 12 months following the 2008 global financial crisis, the value of smaller companies in emerging markets rose more than 150%, with some Brazilian firms surging by about 500% within two years.\nThe company said it has recently taken advantage of the downturn to invest in Hapvida, a Brazilian medical insurer and hospital operator; Advantech, a firm behind technology used in China to monitor the temperatures of people in public places during the pandemic; and the South African pharmacy chain Clicks.\nKeir Starmer, the new leader of the Labour party, said: \u201cNobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis. We should all be asking ourselves what we can do for our country and each other.\u201d\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cThis attitude is about as sick as it comes. Profit seeking from people\u2019s suffering is nearly as low as you can get. When we come through this we need a windfall tax on the profiteers.\u201d\nNo fan of Rees-Mogg, and of course super-profits must be properly taxed, but this is a bit silly. SCM wants to invest in bombed out share prices. This is actually a good thing as higher share prices will make it easier for those businesses to attract fresh capital and survive. https://t.co/TyUmoam9P3\nHowever, Jolyon Maugham, the campaigning lawyer who backed legal action against Brexit, described the criticism as \u201ca bit silly\u201d.\n\u201cNo fan of Rees-Mogg, and of course super-profits must be properly taxed, but this is a bit silly. SCM wants to invest in bombed out share prices. This is actually a good thing as higher share prices will make it easier for those businesses to attract fresh capital and survive,\u201d Maugham said on Twitter.\nOliver Crawley, a partner at SCM, said: \u201cOur thoughts are with those suffering as a result of these tragic circumstances and we are full of admiration for the huge commitment so many are making to fight this pandemic.\n\u201cOur fund managers\u2019 investment commentary is focused on the valuations currently seen in the emerging markets, not the appalling human cost of the virus, and we sincerely hope these comments are not misconstrued as being unsympathetic.\u201d",

Numerous poorer performing retailers, including Debenhams and vintage-inspired retailer Cath Kidston, are on the verge of collapse.\nMany brands continue to trade online. But some, including Next and Moss Bros, have been forced to close even those operations because of difficulties in protecting workers picking and packing goods in warehouses from infection. Even those companies able to sell online have seen a big slump in orders as the nation lives in its pyjamas and sweat pants during the lockdown.\nOne distribution firm estimated that warehouse space across the UK was more than 90% full and inquiries for emergency clothing storage were up by a quarter ahead of Easter, usually a strong sales period.\nSuppliers and warehouse operators said there were urgent negotiations about how to house about two weeks worth of stock currently on container ships heading for the UK.\nOne major high street clothing supplier told the Guardian: \u201cSpring/summer season has been cancelled. People will try to reuse stock next year but they will have to slash prices to try and generate cash and some styles will no longer be relevant.\n\u201cThere will be containers being docked at [ports] for a fee of \u00a3120 a day. All sorts of measures will be taken, because it\u2019s a desperate time.\u201d\nAnother industry insider agreed that discounting was unlikely to clear stock. \u201cNo one buys T-shirts in the winter. The industry has lost a season,\u201d the source said.\nIn the past week it has emerged that both Debenhams and Cath Kidston are preparing to call in administrators, putting thousands of jobs at risk in the already battered retail sector.\nCath Kidston, which has 60 stores in the UK and a further 180 overseas, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal process which protects the business from creditors for 10 working days, as it considers potential rescue options. The company employs 941 people in the UK, 820 of whom were furloughed on 22 March under the government scheme.\nAdvisory firm Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) was appointed last month to help Cath Kidston seek a buyer as the British brand, which opened its first store in 1993, struggled to make a profit for its Hong Kong-based owner Baring Private Equity Asia.\nCath Kidston Group has been in difficulties for some time, recording a pretax loss of \u00a342.3m in the year to the end of March 2018 when sales rose just 1.2% and it closed small retail businesses in France and Spain.\nCoronavirus lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere have only added to the difficulties and it is understood that even if a buyer is found, the rescue is likely to involve a pre-pack administration.\nA Cath Kidston spokesperson said: \u201cThe notice of intention forms part of the process by which Cath Kidston is continuing to work with A&M to explore all options for the company in the current climate.\u201d\nDebenhams is preparing to call in administrators after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the lockdown while Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge, is expected to permanently close hundreds of stores as it suffers from competition from the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark.\nThe lockdown has added to existing pressures on retailers from the consumer switch to online shopping and rising costs from business rates coupled with the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote.\nFashion brands have been hit particularly hard as young people switch from spending on outfits to alternatives such as digital subscriptions and mobile phones.",

However, Uefa remains intent on finishing the Champions League and Europa League seasons and has warned that any domestic leagues which are abandoned prematurely could result in teams being excluded from its competitions in the future.\n\u201cThe fact is that we really don\u2019t know much,\u201d Ceferin told the German broadcaster ZDF. \u201cWe are waiting for the development of this terrible situation in the world, and mainly in Europe. Football isn\u2019t the same without fans \u2026 it is definitely better to play with fans than without fans.\n\u201cIt is still better to play the game behind closed doors and have it on TV, which is what the people need and want because it brings positive energy to their homes, than not playing at all. That\u2019s what the people want, that brings positive energy, and it will be July or August. We can\u2019t play it out in September or October.\u201d\nPushed on whether the season could be abandoned totally, Ceferin said: \u201cIf the authorities do not allow us to play, then we cannot play.\u201d\nUefa was forced to issue a statement on Sunday denying reported comments from Ceferin that the Champions League had to finish by 3 August.\n\u201cThis is not true,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe president was very clear not to set exact dates for the end of the season. Uefa is currently analysing all options to complete domestic and European seasons with the European Club Association and the European Leagues in the working group set up on 17 March. The primary priority of all the members of the working group is to preserve public health.\n\u201cFollowing on from that, it is to find calendar solutions to complete all competitions. Options are currently being studied to play matches in July and in August if needed, depending on restart dates and the permission of national authorities.\u201d\nCeferin also admitted that Uefa is considering postponing its Financial Fair Play regulations for at least a season given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, although it is understood that Manchester City\u2019s appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their two-year ban could still be conducted via conference call in May or June.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be flexible because the clubs are in deep financial problems. They cannot perform the FFP now. For now, we are postponing it to see how the season goes, but we can decide either way.\u201d",

I have been a driver on London buses for 24 years and I can tell you that we are a family. What has happened to our colleagues hits us all,\u201d he said.\nMurphy said that as of last Wednesday all of London\u2019s 80 bus garages had procured hand gel for drivers and other staff. The problem, Murphy said, was that there was a lack of sanitising wipes that drivers could use both in the garage and out on journeys with the public.\n\u201cUnite, working with Transport for London and the bus companies, have managed to secure plenty of hand gel \u2013 but what we are waiting for are the sanitising wipes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere appears to be a big shortage of wipes and they are needed. I understand that because production is dramatically down and factories are closing there is a real shortage, but we are calling on Transport for London to seek a new source for them as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe former bus driver stressed that every bus on London\u2019s streets and roads was now deep cleaned overnight before it left the garage, but said he was calling on both TfL and the bus companies to allow Unite shop stewards access to any deep clean that took place, if members requested it, to reassure bus workers that the vehicles had been properly cleaned.\nMurphy said the installation of protective Perspex booths was \u201cstill on a rolling basis\u201d and not all buses on the road were fitted with them.\n\u201cGiven that the fleet is running on reduced services, perhaps Transport for London could fit the buses not in use with the booths so that drivers on every route still operating will be behind Perspex as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\nDr John Ashton, a public health expert who is currently advising the Bahraini government on its response to the Covid-19 crisis, said it was essential that bus drivers wear masks as well as working behind protective screens.\nThe former regional director of public health in Northwest England said: \u201cReally the bus drivers and indeed public transport workers should be afforded the same protection as NHS staff. That means they should be given face masks and all should be tested for the virus. This is so obvious. They are public servants working day in day out with the public and they need everything at their disposal to protect themselves and those they come into contact with.\u201d\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said he was \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d by the news of the bus workers\u2019 deaths. He promised to bring in further measures to ensure higher levels of protection across the London transport system.\nKhan said: \u201cI have been clear that our incredible public transport staff, on the buses, tubes, trams and trains, are critical workers, making a heroic effort to allow our NHS staff to save more lives.\n\u201cBut we all need to play our part too, and that means fewer Londoners using the public transport network.\u201d",

Liverpool are the latest Premier League club to use the government\u2019s furlough scheme, joining Bournemouth, Newcastle, Norwich and Tottenham.\nSpirit of Shankly has since written an open letter to Moore, asking for clarity. It has asked for details on how many staff will be affected, what their roles are, and if any workers will be released. It has also requested details on how Liverpool reached their decision, who was involved in implementing it, if other solutions were considered, and how much using the scheme will cost the taxpayer.\n\u201cYou will have seen the overwhelmingly negative fan reaction to the club\u2019s announcement stating their intention to furlough a number of employees,\u201d wrote Joe Blott, the Spirit of Shankly chair. \u201cWe understand this is essentially an employee/employer issue but as LFC\u2019s recognised official supporter representatives we are concerned about the damage this is causing to our club\u2019s reputation and values.\u201d\nThe West Brom chief executive, Mark Jenkins, meanwhile, has taken a 100% reduction in his salary as the Championship club look to protect themselves against the disruption caused by the crisis. Jenkins said other senior executives have also offered to take significant pay cuts. He added that West Brom may still have to consider furloughing staff.\n\u201cLike many other clubs we have considered using a furlough approach with non-playing staff who are now unable to work owing to the lockdown and we have made plans for this eventuality,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAt present we have not been required to sanction this action but if the lockdown continues and football remains on hold then this decision may have to be changed.\n\u201cWhat we will pledge is to ensure none of the staff affected suffer a reduction in pay; the club will make up the 20% shortfall not covered by the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme.\u201d",

Barbados reported the death of an 81-year-old man who had an underlying medical condition and who had travelled to the UK.\nScotland\u2019s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the pandemic after it was revealed she had twice visited her family\u2019s second home. Catherine Calderwood will remain in the post and continue advising the Scottish government but will step back from public roles.\nPakistan has quarantined 20,000 worshippers and is looking for tens of thousands of others who attended a religious event in Lahore in March despite the pandemic. Authorities said they want to test or quarantine 100,000 people who were at the event held by the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary movement, between 10 and 12 March.\nLebanon has begun repatriating nationals in its first flights in weeks since it closed its international airport in response to the pandemic. Authorities said more than 20,000 people had signed up to be repatriated this week or at the end of the month.\nPope Francis has celebrated Palm Sunday mass without the public because of the pandemic, which he said should focus people\u2019s attention on what\u2019s most important. Normally, tens of thousands would have gathered for an outdoor mass, but this year the pontiff celebrated without the crowds and inside St Peter\u2019s Basilica.\nThe number of new cases rose by 270 from the previous morning, while the number of recoveries increased by 491, according to the health ministry. Authorities said the daily rate of new infections has fallen significantly in recent days.\nThe government is drawing up legislation to allow it to take \u201cextraordinary steps\u201d to tackle Covid-19, following concern that its relatively soft approach may be resulting in a higher death rate than in other Nordic countries.

Some clubs have reacted to the postponement of the season by placing non-football staff on furlough.\nWest Ham, who are owned by David Sullivan and David Gold, are looking to go down a different route. The club, whose full-time and part-time staff remain on full pay, have agreed to a rights issue, which is an invitation to existing shareholders to buy additional shares. Sullivan, whose 51% stake makes him the majority shareholder, has already agreed to do so.\nWhether the money raised rises above \u00a330m will depend on how many accept the offer. If they decide not to take up their rights the shares will be offered elsewhere.\nIt is understood the process will take place in May. While West Ham have no financial problems at the moment, that is likely to change if there is no prospect of their season resuming. Clubs are set to suffer serious losses of earnings and have warned players they could lose up to an estimated \u00a31.137bn if the season does not resume.

        "content": "Exclusive: Reforms designed to protect youth implemented after outcry at unfair treatment wound back as centres near capacity \nThe population of Queensland\u2019s youth detention centres has ballooned to near capacity amid a government-sponsored crime crackdown, prompting concern from human rights activists that vulnerable children are being placed at risk during the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe state\u2019s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said without urgent attention, he thought it \u201cinevitable\u201d that children would again be \u201cwarehoused for prolonged periods\u201d in police watch houses \u2013 a situation that provoked outcry about their treatment and prompted reforms of the youth justice system.\n\u201cLast year we saw children held in adult watch houses in some cases for weeks on end,\u201d McDougall told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cOn the present trajectory we are rapidly approaching the same situation and the Covid-19 pandemic brings another layer of complexity to this crisis.\u201d\nIn 2018, Guardian Australia reported concerns about children being held in watch houses for extended periods due to overcrowded detention centres.\nThe ABC\u2019s Four Corners program last year revealed that children as young as 10 had been housed in police custody alongside maximum security offenders.\nThe program prompted significant reform by the Queensland government and its approach was praised by human rights groups. It established a separate department for youth justice and announced initiatives to keep children out of detention and watch houses.\nLast month the government made an about-face policy pivot: it announced a new \u201chard line on youth crime\u201d approach that aimed to place more children in detention. This was partly a response to vocal campaigning by local media in Townsville, where Labor seats are considered vulnerable at this year\u2019s state election.\nIn its announcement, the government said it would take \u201ctougher action on bail\u201d including seeking to keep more children on remand, and a \u201cpolice blitz on bail\u201d to appeal court decisions.\n\u201cThese are changes our MPs in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and the Gold Coast have advocated and the government has acted,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said.\nThis week, there are 223 children in youth detention centres; significantly up from late last year, when the initial youth justice reforms were starting to take effect.\nThere are 258 youth detention beds in Queensland, but it is unclear whether these are all available, as ongoing expansion works at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre had temporarily reduced its capacity, and these works are ongoing.\nHuman rights advocates with knowledge of Queensland\u2019s youth detention system say the \u201csafe\u201d capacity of these centres is below the total bed numbers, as crowded facilities limit the ability of authorities to separate detainees of different ages and risk profiles.\nCrowding is often also considered a contributing factor to incidents in youth detention centres. On 18 March, a disturbance occurred at the Townsville centre that involved three boys climbing on to the roof.\nMcDougall said the overwhelming majority of children in youth detention were from Aboriginal families, and many were accused of offences while living in unstable residential care arrangements.\n\u201cThe situation calls for intensive resources to be made available to Aboriginal controlled organisations to assist the safe return of children to Aboriginal families and kinship carers. Aboriginal voices need to be heard in the process of finding creative solutions to this pressing crisis.\u201d\nConcerns about \u201chard line\u201d policies disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and broad powers given to police to enforce public health regulations.\nAmnesty International Indigenous rights campaigner Lidia Thorpe said detention often took children out of safe environments with family.\n\u201cLocking them up is putting them at more risk, given we\u2019ve seen already this virus has got into prisons. Because of the overcrowding it puts kids or anyone at more risk of getting the virus.\n\u201cThe safest place for these kids is at home.\u201d\nThorpe was critical of the government\u2019s youth crime shift, which she said fed into a narrative that promotes racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people.\n\u201cI think we have to keep in mind the Queensland election is coming up and unfortunately when we do have progressive governments in power, it becomes a race to the bottom on law and order. We\u2019ve seen this around the country where we\u2019ve had Labor governments in power.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to suggest that when we see a child misbehaving that the best thing for that is to lock them up and isolate them. If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but [because] it\u2019s happening to Aboriginal people it\u2019s like it\u2019s expected.\u201d\nThe office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses \u2013 down from 34 in March 2019 \u2013 and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing.\n\u201cThe average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,\u201d a spokesman for the minister said.\n\u201cThe government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol.\n\u201cThis investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.\u201d",

        "content": "Manufacturers making huge profits supplying to whoever can pay the most and pay fastest\nThe scramble for face masks has created a \u201cmadhouse\u201d atmosphere among Chinese manufacturers, who are making huge profits as customers around the world fight to be the first in line.\nProducers of masks and respirators are demanding to be paid in full before the products leave their factories and are supplying whoever can pay the most and pay fastest, according to Michael Crotty, a textile broker based in Shanghai.\nCrotty, of Golden Pacific Fashion and Design, said he had spent all of Sunday dealing with a flood of new enquiries from US states, national governments, cities, hospitals, distributors and private companies seeking to protect their employees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a madhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney talks. The factory knows one thing: what\u2019s in my bank account and when did it get there? And if it gets there before the other guy then that\u2019s who is going to get the production time.\u201d\nFactories that have quickly changed their production lines to make masks are demanding 50% payment when an order is made and the other 50% before the masks leave the factory. With scams proliferating, those are often unacceptable terms to many buyers, especially those spending taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\u201cThe factory doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting orders from people they\u2019ve never heard of before. It\u2019s a really unusual circumstance to have these factories absolutely in the driver\u2019s seat. And they\u2019re in the driving seat not of a Volkswagen but of a Mercedes limousine.\u201d\nWearing masks has long been common in parts of Asia to combat air pollution and the spread of disease, but until now was rare in Europe and the US.\nThe masks on the market range from thin cotton coverings to fine-mesh surgical masks and respirators that form a seal over the mouth and nose and have to conform to strict specifications.\nSome European countries are weighing up whether to advise the public to wear masks when not at home. Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d\nFrench and German officials blamed the US last week for using \u201cwild west\u201d tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair.\nOver the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had \u201cseized\u201d a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city\u2019s police force, a claim that led to an accusation of \u201cmodern piracy\u201d from Berlin\u2019s state interior minister, Andreas Geisel.\nAccording to Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was.\nDer Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction.\nThe company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use \u201cany and all authority\u201d to procure the protective equipment it needs.\n\u201cWe need the masks. We don\u2019t want other people getting it,\u201d Trump said in a Saturday briefing to reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re instituting [the] defence production act. You could call it retaliation because that\u2019s what it is: it\u2019s a retaliation. If people don\u2019t give us what we need for our people, we\u2019re going to be very tough.\u201d\n3M issued a statement on Friday saying that cutting off supplies of protective equipment to Canada and Latin America could cause a humanitarian crisis, but Trump stepped up his attacks on the company over the weekend.\n\u201cThe people that have dealt with them, have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month, And they don\u2019t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don\u2019t frankly like the representatives of 3M,\u201d he said.\nLast week the US authorised the importation of respirator masks from China made to a Chinese standard that is close to US specifications for the N95, which filters at least 95% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger. (The European equivalent is the FFP2 respirator.)\nAt the same time, stung by widespread reports of shoddy masks imported from China, Beijing took action to regulate producers. However, Crotty said the effect of the regulation has been to cut off supply. Beijing is only giving certification to companies that have previously sold on the Chinese domestic market, but Crotty said four-fifth of the factories he dealt with manufacture solely for the export market.\n\u201cOnly 20% might have these certificates, so of course they\u2019re going to raise prices higher,\u201d he said. But he added that masks without certification could still be exported if they were labelled for personal or commercial use only.\nCrotty said everyone involved in the market was trying to improvise in unique circumstances. \u201cNone of us have ever seen anything like this. The reaction to the pandemic in the US was not very well prepared. So I think hopefully there\u2019ll be big lessons learned through all of this, when this tapers off.\u201d",

        "content": "Watford general hospital declared a critical incident on Saturday over pressure to vital supplies\nOxygen supplies at a Hertfordshire hospital inundated with coronavirus patients became so precarious last week that officials considered how to decide who should receive the gas and who should miss out and likely die, the Guardian understands.\nThe oxygen system at Watford general hospital came close to breaking point on Saturday, when a critical incident was declared and staff had to tell the public not to come to the hospital. Some patients were moved out to prevent the vital system failing.\nLast week, health planners in Hertfordshire, where more than 800 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, became so concerned about oxygen supplies they alerted the military that they might need help. The area has been under huge pressure from the Covid-19 pandemic, with mortuary space filling up and plans being made to increase capacity four-fold. As of 5pm Thursday, 29 people had died at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust hospitals after being diagnosed with Covid-19. The trust is responsible for Watford general as well as Hemel Hempstead and St Albans City hospitals.\nA senior clinician said: \u201cThey were [consulting] the hospital ethics committee every day and considering who they were not going to oxygenate and ventilate if they needed it, and making decisions about who would be triaged to not have oxygen and die.\u201d\nThe decision to announce a critical incident on Saturday meant no one had to go without oxygen, the trust said.\nOxygen therapy is key to the successful treatment of advanced cases of Covid-19, and last Tuesday NHS England warned hospitals across the country about the risk to supplies in an urgent patient safety notice. It highlighted the dramatic recent increase in hospitals\u2019 use of ventilators and in particular CPAP machines, which dispense ventilation through a face mask.\nThe pressure on Watford general\u2019s oxygen system was not unexpected, according to documents seen by the Guardian.\nLast week, healthcare planners in the area said they pleaded with the government and the NHS to urgently approve works to the hospital\u2019s oxygen system and warned NHS England on Wednesday that the situation was critical.\nHowever, NHS England said that it had alerted trusts, including West Hertfordshire, to the need to prepare their oxygen systems in February when the threat of the coronavirus epidemic was looming.\n\u201cAll trusts were written to by NHS England in February reminding them to carry out engineering checks on ventilation equipment, and were further issued with guidance on how to use the kit safely, on 1 April,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nWorks to overhaul Watford general\u2019s oxygen supply system had been planned before the outbreak, but were put on hold. Local planners felt their attempts to get them urgently restarted were frustrated by communication difficulties in central government, the documents show.\nOn Friday, the day before the critical incident was declared, the planners considered making a military aid request and began a process that could allow the armed forces to step in and help.\n\u201cOn 30 March, the multi-agency group in Hertfordshire asked the government to get the works moving as they had been planned for some time, and they noted how urgent they were, but nothing happened,\u201d the senior clinician said. \u201cThere was no response. On 1 April, the trust reported that they were at max capacity for oxygen and we raised the issue with NHS England and got nowhere.\u201d\nWest Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust declined to comment beyond giving its account of the incident on Saturday.\nThe trust said it was \u201ca technical issue with our individual hospital\u2019s oxygen equipment, which does not pose any risk to our patients\u201d. It added that \u201ca safe level of oxygen [was] maintained throughout\u201d. The incident was triggered by growing concern that the system was close to capacity, sources said.\nHowever, NHS England said it was not a result of capacity problems \u201cbut due to a technical fault in their oxygen ventilation equipment, which engineers are now fixing, with the critical incident stood down last night.\u201d\nReferring to consultations with the ethics committee about what would happen in the event of severe oxygen problems, the NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cThe incident did not lead to any patient harm, however in any major incident it is absolutely right that hospitals plan for every possible scenario to manage patient care.\u201d\nDaisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat MP for St Albans, said: \u201cI raised the question of possible oxygen shortages with the government privately more than a week ago and this weekend Watford general A&E had to close for a day because its oxygen equipment malfunctioned.\n \u201cThe government must now ensure that Watford general has whatever resources it needs to shore up ventilation systems, given the expectation that numbers of Covid-19 patients will continue to rise in the coming days.\n \u201cFor hospitals like Watford general which are near capacity, we need to know now what steps will be taken to signpost coronavirus patients, in real time, to the nearest medical facilities with capacity. The government must commit that, if needed, it will relocate Hertfordshire patients with coronavirus to the new Nightingale hospital in London, or build additional field hospitals to serve areas including Hertfordshire.\u201d\nA senior consultant in London warned that hospitals in the capital were also reaching capacity. \u201cWe had a meeting at midday on Saturday with other south London hospitals to look at beds data, as we are pretty much full,\u201d the doctor told the Guardian.\n\u201cThe Nightingale hospital will only open just in time, and for the next few days we are managing capacity as best we can \u2026 everywhere is up to the limit. That is reflective of elsewhere in London,\u201d he added.\nHe said that transferring patients across hospitals through the South London transfer network has \u201csaved multiple lives and them offloading us prevents us from making difficult choices. We would have run out of ventilators if we could not have transferred patients out to other hospitals\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cMy fear is that I will end up confronting a patient who I would need to intubate but do not have the machines to do it, so being unable to help a patient as I don\u2019t have the kit. I hope not to be in that situation, but the fear would be that I am.\u201d",

        "content": "Airbnb created an industry and changed the face of many neighbourhoods. Now it\u2019s facing the challenge of the coronavirus\nAirbnb was built on the premise of bringing the world closer together. Tourists could travel like locals, while locals could cash in on their desirable neighbourhood properties by letting those visitors in. Last year the company was estimated to be worth more than US$30bn. It is scheduled to go public in 2020. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTravel is suspended. Australians are almost entirely confined to their homes. Now the once heralded disruptor is seeing a collapse in bookings. The hosts who have become reliant on income-generating properties to pay their bills are being bled dry by a lack of business, and already-suspicious neighbours are up in arms over the potential that short-term renters may spread the virus.\nIn the decade before the pandemic, Airbnb became \u201cthis very attractive thing\u201d, says Chris Martin, a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales\u2019s City Futures Research Centre. The platform, and others like it, fundamentally changed not only the travel industry but housing and rental markets. A home is no longer just a home, Martin says. \u201c[The company] tapped into the idea that a person\u2019s house can also be viewed as an asset that has capacity for generating income.\u201d\nThis shift \u201cmassively upped the scale of [short-term rental]\u201d, which in turn put pressure on residential rental markets. The changes have resulted in lawsuits in the US and a petition by 10 cities to the European parliament in 2019. There are more than seven million Airbnb listings spread across 100,000 cities \u2013 with an estimated 346,581 listings between July 2016 and February 2019 in Australia alone.\nStephen Colman, who was an Airbnb host and ran an Airbnb management business up until last year, says \u201cthe whole industry has fallen through\u201d. Many hosts are either pulling out of Airbnb to find cheaper long-term tenants or have been offering \u201c14-day isolation suites\u201d.\nThe former, Colman says, will come with a long wait and big rent cuts, as everyone else rushes to do the same. The latter is even more fraught. This week the Greens state MP for Ballina, Tamara Smith, called on online holiday booking websites such as Airbnb and Stayz in the Byron Bay region to stop marketing regional properties as ideal places for self-isolation, saying it wasn\u2019t fair on regional hospitals and communities.\n\u201cThere are real concerns around cleaning stuff,\u201d Colman says, \u201cHow many hours between checkout and check-in \u2026 [Hosts] have seen a fightback from body corporates who are just outright cancelling the key fobs for anyone who they believe is doing Airbnb. They\u2019ve just gone \u2018we\u2019re going to take this hard line to protect the safety of our long-term tenants\u2019.\u201d\nJane Hearn, deputy chair of the Owners Corporation Network, has argued that opening Airbnb properties for quarantine \u201cincreases the viral load on apartment owners and tenants\u201d. Resident advocacy groups such as We Live Here and Neighbours Not Strangers were already lobbying against Airbnb on behalf of local communities who were sick of rowdy travellers in their apartment complexes. In a letter to New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian on 1 April, Neighbours Not Strangers called for an immediate ban on all short-term rentals, due to the risks from Covid-19.\nAirbnb does not support reservation requests from users who are showing symptoms, or those who are awaiting test results. Last week the company instituted a ban on any listings that \u201creference Covid-19, coronavirus or quarantine\u201d and listings which \u201cincentivise bookings through Covid-19-related discounts, stocks of limited resources, or the highlighting of quarantine-friendly listing attributes\u201d. The company\u2019s updated instructions for cleaning and hygiene recommend hosts stock their properties with \u201ca few extras\u201d like \u201cantibacterial hand sanitizer, disposable gloves and wipes, hand soap, paper towels, tissues\u201d \u2026 and toilet paper.\nThe government has now mandated that all international arrivals must complete their quarantine at designated pre-booked hotels. But, before that, some Australians were happy turning to Airbnb. Comedian Alice Fraser is currently in a \u201cgood value\u201d Bondi Airbnb after returning from London. She saw Airbnb as \u201cthe responsible option\u201d: \u201c[It\u2019s there] for people who don\u2019t have favours to call in, or family who happen to have a massive home that can be segmented into parts.\u201d\nLisa Porgazian and her husband have listed their three Gold Coast apartments on Airbnb for the past four years. Now the properties are empty, and the mortgage payments will come out of the couple\u2019s superannuation. \u201cWe were relying on this for our income, as well as our retirement plan,\u201d she says, distraught. \u201cNow that\u2019s completely died in the arse.\u201d\nPorgazian, a 46-year-old former IT contractor, has been managing her property portfolio full-time. She\u2019s unable to work in many other jobs due to rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cI\u2019m earning zero. My husband\u2019s earning zero. And we\u2019ve still got these mortgages to pay.\u201d\nWith the spread of Covid-19, a downturn in business was inevitable. But many Airbnb hosts were shocked at how quickly it came. The company introduced a policy earlier this month allowing all guests who booked prior to 14 March (and were checking in no later than 31 May) to cancel existing bookings for free. Porgazian says this left hosts holding the cheque.\n\u201cWe lost everything straight away \u2026 Everything is cancelled, basically until Christmas.\u201d\nSusan Wheeldon, Airbnb\u2019s country manager for Australia and New Zealand, said offering these free cancellations \u201cwasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d, but it was one made with \u201cpublic health considerations\u201d front of mind. \u201cThe primary consideration for us was protecting the wellbeing of the community.\u201d\nTravis Lipshus, a real estate agent in Byron Bay, thinks this chaos for Airbnb hosts could result in cheaper long-term rent for locals. He\u2019s getting flooded with properties from Airbnb hosts who now need permanent tenants. But with so many of the town\u2019s hospitality staff and backpackers currently out of work \u201cthere\u2019s not enough tenants to fill these places\u201d.\nIf rents did lower, it would be a massive relief. It\u2019s notoriously difficult for locals to find affordable rentals in Byron Bay, as 17.6% of properties are listed as holiday accommodation. \u201cAirbnb should be banned up here,\u201d Lipshus says. \u201cThe cost of living is insane. I\u2019ve lived in all sorts of places here, and it\u2019s not uncommon to pay at least 50% of your wage in rent.\u201d\nMartin describes the current regulation around Airbnb as \u201creally quite liberal\u201d. He says at present, it \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to fit well with highly local impacts. Local councils [should] have a strategy and a plan around short-term letting \u2013 especially around limits.\u201d\nFor now, he is not so certain we\u2019ll see a drop in rents. \u201cLandlords may still withhold properties and leave them vacant instead,\u201d he says. \u201cFor whatever reason, that seems to be a surprisingly common scenario in the high-pressure [locations].\u201d\nWheeldon says that Airbnb \u201chas not seen a material drop in the overall number of listings on our platform. While the Covid-19 crisis has significantly disrupted the tourism industry and wider economy, we know that travel is resilient in the long term and will ultimately recover.\u201d\nBut will the hosts recover?\n\u201cWe know our hosts are doing it tough,\u201d Wheeldon says. The peak body representing Airbnb and other short term rental companies has sought urgent support from the federal government for hosts in the form of mortgage payment deferrals, among other measures. For many, that may not be enough.\n\u201cA lot of people have over-leveraged themselves with these properties,\u201d Lipshus says. \u201cThe upper-middle class are probably going to be fine. But the middle class \u2013 the ones taking risks, trying to get up that class ladder \u2013 they\u2019re going to be pretty fucked.\u201d\nLisa Porgazian knows what people are saying. \u201cThe criticism that we\u2019re getting is \u2018well you shouldn\u2019t have a business if you can\u2019t pay for it\u2019, but who ever predicted something like this?\u201d",

The audience for ITV\u2019s broadcast of the race, meanwhile, peaked at nearly 5m viewers \u2013 around half the number that would have been expected to tune in to watch Tiger Roll attempt to win an unprecedented third successive National.\nBookmakers accepted bets on the race, in which the odds were fixed, up to a maximum of \u00a310 each-way per horse. The average stake placed is reported to have been \u00a32 per customer. The profits from bets placed in Ireland will be donated to Irish charities, including the Irish Red Cross.\n\u201cWe are overwhelmed with the public support for the Virtual Grand National,\u201d Michael Dugher, the chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, an umbrella body for gambling operators, said on Sunday. \u201cWhen the nation was in much need of some light relief, millions joined in the fun in honour of one of Britain\u2019s greatest sporting events and helped raise a fantastic amount for our brave heroes in the NHS.\u201d\nITV broadcast a half-hour programme on Saturday that featured the virtual event at 5.15pm, the intended off time for the cancelled race. It had an average audience of 4.3m, a 28% share, with a peak of 4.8m (30% audience share). Last year\u2019s Virtual Grand National attracted 737,000 viewers, while nearly 10m watched Tiger Roll land the race for the second year running.\nThe Grand National is by far the most watched horse race annually, and with most of the country at home due to the lockdown to fight the spread of coronavirus, the audience for this year\u2019s virtual substitute compares favourably with the figure for many other high-profile events during the racing season.\nThe peak audience for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, which is run on a Friday, has averaged 1.6m over the past four years, while last year\u2019s Derby, on the first Saturday in June, pulled in 1.75m viewers at peak. Royal Ascot in June last year, meanwhile, reached a daily average peak of 1.25m.\nThe computer programme used to create the virtual race took the form of 40 horses that were among the initial entries for the Grand National and produced a list of fixed odds on each runner\u2019s chance, before using a random number generator to pick a 1-2-3-4.\nThe process came up with a decent result for the books, as Potters Corner (18-1) \u201cbeat\u201d Walk In The Mill (16-1) and Any Second Now (10-1) with Tiger Roll, the 5-1 favourite and likely to be the best-backed runner, in fourth.",

Government specialists on Monday sent to monitor the situation reported that there was no rise in radiation levels in Kyiv or the city suburbs.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of opening your windows and airing out your home during the quarantine,\u201d wrote Yegor Firsov, head of Ukraine\u2019s state ecological inspection service, in a Facebook post about the results of the radiation tests.\nAs of Monday afternoon, the country\u2019s emergency ministry said that the remaining fire in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone covered about 20 hectares and was still being extinguished. Footage released by the ministry showed firefighters dousing flames on the forest floor, and clouds of smoke rising.\nPolice have arrested a suspect believed to have caused the blaze, a 27-year-old man from the area who reportedly told police he had set grass and rubbish on fire in three places \u201cfor fun\u201d. After he had lit the fires, he said, the wind had picked up and he had been unable to extinguish them.\nAn earlier post by Firsov had warned about heightened radiation levels at the site of the fire, which he said had been caused by the \u201cbarbaric\u201d practice of local grass fires often started in the spring and autumn. \u201cThere is bad news \u2013 radiation is above normal in the fire\u2019s centre,\u201d Firsov wrote on Sunday.\nThe post included a video with a Geiger counter showing radiation at 16 times above normal. The fire had spread to about 100 hectares of forest, Firsov wrote.\nThe country\u2019s emergency ministry put out a warning for Kyiv on Monday about poor air quality but said it was related to meteorological conditions, and not to the fire.\nThe service had said on Saturday that increased radiation in some areas had led to \u201cdifficulties\u201d in fighting the fire, while stressing that people living nearby were not in danger. On Monday, it said that gamma radiation levels had not risen near the fire.\nChernobyl polluted a large area of Europe when its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986, with the region immediately around the power plant the worst affected. People are not allowed to live within 30km of the power station.\nThe three other reactors at Chernobyl continued to generate electricity until the power station finally closed in 2000.

        "content": "Thousands of council workers could have been deployed by the government but were not asked\nThe government has been accused of missing an opportunity after it failed to deploy 5,000 contact tracing experts employed by councils to help limit the spread of coronavirus.\nEnvironmental health workers in local government have wide experience in contact tracing, a process used to prevent infections spreading and routinely carried out in outbreaks such as of norovirus, salmonella or legionnaires\u2019 disease. But a spokesperson for Public Health England (PHE), which leads on significant outbreaks, said the organisation did not call upon environmental health workers to carry out contact tracing for coronavirus, instead using its own local health protection teams.\nAccording to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health the UK has, at a conservative estimate, 5,000 environmental health officers working in local councils nationwide.\nThe institute\u2019s Northern Ireland director, Gary McFarlane, said government health bodies \u201cabsolutely should be drawing on the skills set of EHOs [environmental health officers] and if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s a missed opportunity\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is significant capacity that is sitting there for this kind of work to be done.\u201d\nPHE\u2019s contact tracing response team was boosted to just under 300 staff, deemed adequate for the containment phase of handling the Covid-19 virus up to mid-March. In that time the team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. Tracing was scaled back when the UK moved to the delay phase of tackling coronavirus in mid-March. It is now carried out in limited form, mainly for vulnerable communities.\nAn environmental health worker for a council in Scotland, who does not want to be named, said: \u201cIf councils had been given the go-ahead from the start, they could have put plans in place and now have a much flatter curve.\u201d Another, with decades of experience, said he was \u201cstruggling to figure out\u201d why this was not the case.\nOne environmental health worker for a north-western council said his team were expecting a call at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. He said: \u201cWe are pretty good at infection control and contact tracing, it\u2019s part of the job. We thought we\u2019d be asked and were shelving other work.\u201d\nEnvironmental health workers have recently been tasked with ensuring the public stick to social distancing rules. They have also been monitoring takeaways and food deliveries. Environment health departments have, like other areas of local government, suffered austerity cuts since 2010.\nContact tracing involves getting in touch with everyone an infected person might have seen and asking them to self-isolate in an effort to contain the virus.\nThe government decision to all but abandon contact tracing is not consistent with WHO guidelines, which urge a test-and-trace approach. At a WHO media briefing on Covid-19 in March, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \u201cTracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country.\u201d\nThe approach has been carried out in other countries, including Ireland, Germany, South Korea and Singapore. In Germany, thousands of contact tracers are still working \u2013 with more being recruited \u2013 in part clearing a backlog of infections that occurred before the nation\u2019s shutdown measures, according to Dr Philipp Zanger , head of the Institute of Hygiene, Infection Control and Prevention at the Rhineland-Palatinate agency for consumer and public protection.\nContact tracing is also used to prepare to tackle any outbreaks when the lockdown is eased, since \u201conce we let ourselves out again, we will see more transmission again,\u201d he said.\nThe UK government approach is understood to be that once virus infection numbers have tipped, manual contact tracing is unworkable, while social distancing and self-isolation measures reproduce much of its effect.\nBut Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said giving up on it was a mistake. \u201cYou still need to do it,\u201d he said, highlighting regions where infection numbers were relatively small. \u201cIn low-intensity areas you could ramp up your testing \u2026 use all your people to jump on it.\u201d\nEnvironmental health officers say that as well as helping to slow the spread of a virus, tracing could provide information on how it spreads and, if successful in containing outbreaks in specific areas, could help direct healthcare resources.\nThe UK, US and Germany are developing smartphone apps to help trace coronavirus infections to ease national lockdowns. Versions of this technology have been used in South Korea and Singapore. Initial reports suggest the UK app would operate on a voluntary basis, while there are privacy concerns around the security of health and location data provided.\nA PHE spokesperson said that contact tracing was no longer useful because \u201cwith such a level of sustained community transmission there is limited value in doing so\u201d.",

So far one person has died from the virus in New Zealand, a woman in her 70s with underlying health conditions on the west coast.\nBloomfield said he was cautiously optimistic that it appeared coronavirus cases were beginning to flatten out, and it appeared the government\u2019s swift move from level two to four in the space of two days seemed to be working in containing the virus, and stopping widespread community outbreak.\n\u201cSo some success so far, but our aim is to stamp it out,\u201d Dr Bloomfield said.\nThe cautious optimism came as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she would not rule out her and her ministers taking a pay cut to ensure they played their part in getting the country and the economy back on its feet.\n\u201cI know my colleagues well and I know we are all acutely aware of the pain our communities are feeling, so you can imagine the kinds of discussions we\u2019ve been having \u2013 I won\u2019t rule it out,\u201d Ardern said of a potential cut. Ardern makes more than NZ$400,000 a year, while her ministers make more than NZ$200,000.\n\u2018I haven\u2019t given any specificity on numbers or reach, but I won\u2019t rule it out, I think I know pretty well the people I work with.\u201d\nArdern said she was quietly pleased with the progress New Zealand was making with containing the virus, but quashed mounting speculation that the country may move out of total lockdown early. Ardern said the fastest way for Kiwis to get out of lockdown was by adhering to the rules of it and waiting it out.\n\u201cWe have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,\u201d Ardern said.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves \u2026 though the signs are positive.\u201d\nRegions of the country with a high number of cases \u2013 including Auckland and the deep south \u2013 may remain in lockdown longer, Ardern said, and all regions of New Zealand should be prepared for moving in and out of the different alert levels, depending on their situation, after the month-long lockdown ends.",

        "content": "The ACT government said all evictions due to rental arrears would be postponed during the coronavirus pandemic\nThe Australian Capital Territory has pledged not to boot out public housing residents who fall behind on rent during the Coronavirus pandemic, after it was caught pursuing eviction orders against tenants despite the national cabinet\u2019s six-month moratorium.\nAs housing experts call for state and territory governments to enact these moratoriums into law, the Housing ACT was accused of continuing to pursue eviction orders at the ACT\u2019s administrative tribunal over the past few days.\nWith millions of Australians facing unemployment, the national cabinet agreed last week to the six-month moratorium on evictions to keep people in their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, but the measure has only been legislated in Tasmania.\nWhile most states such as New South Wales and Victoria have essentially suspended evictions for unpaid rent, the Guardian was told last week of at least two live public housing evictions cases at the ACT tribunal.\nIn a letter to the housing minister on Monday, Canberra Community Law said that Housing ACT as well as community housing providers have continued to pursue evictions.\nThe letter, which demands Yvette Berry enact a six-month moratorium, is signed by 20 local organisations and public advocates, including the ACT\u2019s human rights commissioner Helen Watchirs and Jodie Griffiths-Cook, the ACT\u2019s public advocate and children and young people commissioner.\nIt stated that \u201capplications for evictions continue to be issued against public housing tenants by the ACT government and by ACT government funded organisations against community housing tenants in the ACT\u201d.\nAsked to respond to the letter, a spokesperson for Berry confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that the government would not evict ACT public housing tenants due to rental arrears.\n\u201cAll orders for evictions due to rental arrears will be postponed for the duration of the pandemic,\u201d they said.\nThe Guardian raised with the ACT\u2019s Community Services Directorate that there were at least two current public housing eviction cases that were with the tribunal in recent days.\nBerry\u2019s spokesperson confirmed that there were three existing eviction cases, and that the government would now consider \u201cwhether these can proceed in line with the national cabinet position\u201d.\nIn the case of an eviction tenants were relocated to \u201canother public housing property or linked up with an appropriate specialist housing provider\u201d.\n\u201cThe ACT government does not evict public housing tenants into homelessness,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe national cabinet\u2019s declaration of a six-month eviction moratorium was aimed at ensuring \u201cwe won\u2019t have anyone thrown out of their homes,\u201d Morrison said last week.\nAsked about reports that some private landlords were continuing with evictions because there was no moratorium currently in law, Morrison said they needed to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d.\nChris Martin, a housing expert at the University of New South Wales, said only Tasmania had so far passed laws to enact a moratorium on evictions.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been affected in legislation anywhere else yet, and it really needs to be,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\u201cIn the week before the announcement that there would be a moratorium, NSW did pass urgently some amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act that would give the minister a power to make regulations that would prevent evictions.\n\u201cThe minister hasn\u2019t exercised that power yet.\u201d\nNSW\u2019s Department of Communities and Justice said social housing tenants were not being evicted over arrears provided they agreed to a payment plan.\nSpeaking before Berry\u2019s office indicated it would postpone evictions, Sophie Trevitt, a social security and tenancy solicitor at Canberra Community Law, said there were \u201chuge public health implications to evicting public housing tenants during a global health crisis\u201d.\n\u201cPublic housing tenants by definition cannot afford to rent in the private rental market.\n\u201cTherefore, if evicted, they face almost certain homelessness.\u201d\nA spokesperson for NSW\u2019s Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ) said it was not evicting social housing tenants for rental arrears \u201cif they agree to an affordable repayment plan and automatic rent deduction for future payments\u201d.\nThey said the department had suspended rent increases and would not include the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplement in social housing rents.\n\u201cFor the safety and security of all tenants living in social housing, DCJ will continue to take appropriate action in relation to matters of serious antisocial behaviour,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cIn all cases we ensure appropriate support is offered to sustain a tenancy or provide alternative housing options.\u201d\nIn Victoria, public housing evictions have also been suspended with the exception of antisocial behaviour.\nBerry\u2019s spokesperson said the ACT would still pursue evictions as a \u201clast resort\u201d to protect public safety.\nThe Queensland government has indicated that it will pursue a retrospective six-month moratorium to protect tenants before the laws are passed.\nHowever, the state\u2019s Residential Tenancies Authority said last week that all parties needed to be aware that their rights and responsibilities under the law \u201chave not changed at this time\u201d.",

        "content": "Australian high court\u2019s decision is Pell\u2019s last chance to overturn conviction for historical child sexual abuse\nOn Tuesday, almost two years after being committed to stand trial on multiple charges of historical child sexual abuse, the case against the former financial controller of the Vatican, Cardinal George Pell, will likely end with him either walking free or remaining in jail to serve the rest of his sentence.\nAfter failing to appeal to Victoria\u2019s appellate court in August, Pell\u2019s legal team took his case to the high court, the final avenue in his bid for freedom. Across two days in March, the full bench of seven justices heard Pell\u2019s barrister Bret Walker SC argue that Victoria\u2019s appellate judges, who dismissed Pell\u2019s first appeal in 2019 by a majority of two-to-one, may have been unduly influenced by the complainant\u2019s testimony by watching a recorded video of it rather than just reading the transcript of his evidence.\nWalker also argued that just because the complainant was believable and compelling, it should not have led jurors to discount other evidence that placed his evidence in doubt. The director of the Office of Public Prosecutions, Kerri Judd, responded by saying that given Pell\u2019s legal team made so much of the complainant\u2019s lack of credibility and believability, Victoria\u2019s appellate court was entitled to watch the video. It did not mean they had elevated it above other evidence, or that they had not given due weight to other evidence from the trial, she said. She added that the entire body of evidence considered together gave weight to the complainant\u2019s account, rather than discrediting it.\nOnce they return to court on Tuesday the high court bench will immediately deliver its decision as to whether the majority of the seven justices accepts the arguments from Pell\u2019s team and will acquit and release him, or whether the majority dismissed the appeal in which case the guilty verdict will hold and Pell\u2019s opportunities to appeal will have been exhausted.\nBecause of Covid-19 and travel restrictions, it will be difficult for media and the public to attend the decision even though it is being delivered in an open court. Social distancing requirements mean only a handful of people will be able to be in the court room in Brisbane, where the decision is being delivered. The court is not equipped to provide a livestream of the proceedings.\nThe judgment delivery itself will be over in a minute or two, with just the orders being read out by the chief justice Susan Kiefel. The judgment summary will then go live on the court\u2019s website, with the bench\u2019s full reasons for their judgement becoming available shortly after.\nWhile there are a few different scenarios that could unfold, including the court granting leave to appeal on only certain convictions and not others, or sending the original appeal back to court to be reconsidered, the most likely scenarios are that the bench will either grant the appeal and quash the conviction, or refuse the appeal, upholding the conviction.\nNothing can be read into the timing of the decision coming just three weeks after the hearing in Canberra \u2013 it is impossible to predict what the bench will decide. But once the decision comes and the case is over, the child abuse royal commission will be able to release its redacted report into its findings regarding Pell.\nAustralia\u2019s child sexual abuse royal commission, a five-year inquiry into abuses of children in institutional settings including religious ones, redacted large sections of its findings relating to Pell when it handed down its final report in 2017, so as not to influence or jeopardise the legal action.\nPell, Australia\u2019s most senior Catholic, was in December 2018 convicted on five charges. A Melbourne jury found him guilty of sexually abusing two 13-year-old choir boys in the priest\u2019s sacristy of St Patrick\u2019s cathedral after Sunday solemn mass when he was the Archbishop of Melbourne in 1996. He then assaulted one of the boys again a few weeks later. Pell is just over one year in to serving a six-year prison sentence, with a non-parole period of three years and eight months.",

Experts have consistently warned against over-reliance on modelling or viewing it as predictive.\nThe government has unleashed a raft of spending measures to prop up the economy while businesses go into \u201chibernation\u201d, including $130bn for wage subsidies over the next six months and $1.6bn for free childcare over three months, but has emphasised that the expenditure will have to be reined in down the track.\nSome within the government worry there is a point at which imposing stringent restrictions for an extended period might prompt people to flout the social distancing rules while putting additional strain on the nation\u2019s finances. In general, the states and territories have leaned towards moving to tougher restrictions sooner, in a bid to prevent the health system from being overrun with cases.\nThe prime minister acknowledged at a press conference last week that Australians were \u201cmaking big sacrifices\u201d and wanted to know what they were achieving, so the government would share more information about its goals, including intensive care unit targets. Morrison said the national cabinet would keep track of relevant data as it moved into what he called the \u201csuppression phase\u201d.\nThe outlook predicted by the Sydney University simulation is based on a 90% compliance with social distancing rules.\nIt assumes the incidence peak \u2014 the number of new cases reported daily \u2014 was hit in late March, and a prevalence peak \u2014 the number of cases active at once \u2014 in mid-April. Under this scenario the total number of cases in Australia will reach between 8,000 and 10,000. As of Monday, the actual numbers show 5,744 cases.\n\u201cThe incidence peak is fairly clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has fallen and if nothing outrageous happens again, like an outbreak or a new cruise ship disaster, it will continue going down.\u201d\nIf Australians use the cautious optimism of health experts that the epidemic curve is beginning to flatten in Australia as an excuse to relax the rules constricting their daily lives, that outlook changes. An 80% compliance with social distancing would see the number of cases decline, but at a slower rate, and a 70% compliance would see the number of cases continue to rise.\nThe modelling is produced by a simulation designed as a \u201cdigital twin of Australia\u201d, with 24 million individual agents with unique characteristics based on census data, school attendance, geographical distribution and other population inputs, as well as epidemiological characteristics of Covid-19.\nBuilt into the simulation is the assumption that only 67% of all adults with the virus and 13% of all children with the virus are symptomatic, a detail that Prokopenko said is one of the \u201cstrongest parts of the model\u201d.\nThat simulation was used to run scenarios assuming different levels of compliance with self-isolation and social distancing polices, which were then compared with the actual case reports in Australia.\n\u201cAs it so happens, from 24 March it looks like the most correct one is the model that assumes 90% compliance,\u201d he said.\nThey also modelled what would happen if social distancing measures were relaxed.\n\u201cEven if you stayed for 90 days with that 90% compliance and then relaxed it all at once, it will shoot up,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe task is bringing this to zero. Not five, not one, to zero. Because if you still have one remaining case, that one remaining case will go to two the next day, to four the next, and then you get exponential growth.\u201d\nProkopenko suggested that strict social distancing measures would need to remain in place for four weeks after the last known case recovered, to prevent silent spread through asymptomatic cases. And, when social distancing measures are gradually relaxed, Australia would need to follow China in conducting widespread testing and contact tracing to ensure any asymptomatic cases are detected and contained.\n\u201cThis resurgence is not unavoidable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s avoidable with some vigilance.\u201d",

Her day started at 4am and often didn\u2019t finish until 11pm.\n\u201cYou may not know the name John Langdon, who died on 23 March, but you\u2019ll very probably have laughed at his jokes. When the story of BBC Radio Light Entertainment is written, his legend will feature large, not least because he wrote the famous sketch about Derek Jameson (\u201ca man who thinks erudite is a type of glue\u201d) for which the tabloid editor sued the BBC and lost. But to me, he was my best friend, my greatest encourager and, for over 35 years, my constant writing partner.\u201d\nIn Listener\u2019s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians.

The feeling shared among the Welsh is that something is afoot, that Graham Henry\u2019s men could poop the party and deny England a grand slam at the site of their footballing brethren\u2019s greatest sporting triumph, 1966 and all that. How wonderful that would be \u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor the past four days there has been a heavy police presence at the former home of Kenneth Ward. Ward, 72, was jailed in 2011 for indecent exposure and weapons offences after police found a huge haul of weapons including a loaded Luger pistol under his pillow and the cockpit of a second world war fighter plane with working machine guns at his remote cottage.\u201d\n\u201cIn 2017, I was invited to a residency in Lisbon. To cover the fee, I applied for a small literary grant. In my application, I wrote that the residency would give me the opportunity to present my work \u2018within an international context\u2019 for the first time. None of this was technically a lie. But it wasn\u2019t the whole truth, either. My reason for being in Lisbon was to find court documents related to a sexual assault that had been committed against me in the city 11 years earlier, when I was 18 years old.\u201d\n\u201cThe England shirt weighs heavy. So much time has passed without winning. \u201966 is a problem because whenever a World Cup or Euros starts, they think they can do it again. Always, always, always. It\u2019s important to play without that weight, with more freedom. A lot is psychology but, honestly, I think the problem England have is they arrive at tournaments tired. You play a lot of [club] games and your culture is: fight, fight, fight, never stop, even if you\u2019re four down. I liked that.\u201d\n\u2018As soon as the city kicks back into business again, the couple are expected to shoot to the top of everybody\u2019s invite lists. \u201cUltimately, this is a city where royalty trumps celebrity,\u201d says Melanie Bromley, chief news correspondent and head of news operations for E!. \u201cThey are potentially the most famous residents of Los Angeles \u2013 or at least they\u2019re on the same level as Oprah, as that kind of celebrity, AAA list.\u201d\u2019\n\u201cThe leather industry is so misunderstood. People don\u2019t think about where leather comes from, but it\u2019s a natural by-product. The connection between the meat and dairy system and the leather industry has been forgotten, but they are inextricably linked. We\u2019re repurposing a bi-product that comes from an inherently wasteful food system to make a material that\u2019s biodegradable, natural and beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cI did say half-jokingly when we launched that I wanted to destroy capitalism with this programme. Give us one more series and capitalism will probably have destroyed itself by then. We\u2019ll just be doing the clearing up.\u201d\nKeir Starmer securing the Labour leadership was undoubtedly yesterday\u2019s key topic beyond coronavirus, with readers clearly wanting a deeper understanding of the victor. Yesterday\u2019s list contained four Starmer pieces in the top five. I\u2019ve pulled the others together here to give a little more variety to the list over all.\nWhat Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders\nStarmer won handsomely. Now he must convince the nation\nThree key appointments: Starmer fills top shadow cabinet roles\n\u201cAn imposing figure with flowing shoulder-length hair and a straggly beard, colourful waistcoats, shirts and trousers, often topped with a fez, he was a tabloid favourite, not only for his picturesque appearance and peculiar artistic tastes but for his string of mistresses, whom he referred to as his wifelets (he reckoned there to have been around 74 of them). He painted portraits of 69 of them and decorated a staircase at Longleat with them \u2013 one visitor remarked that the paintings all looked the same.\u201d\n\u2018An influential conservative cardinal has established himself as a \u201cparallel authority\u201d to Pope Francis, according to a new book that depicts the pontiff as a prophetic reformer who is surrounded by opponents waging \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d against him.\u2019\n\u2018Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u2018good\u2019 intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 never really registered on his radar.\u201d\n\u201cWe worked with the intelligence community over the years, and I\u2019ve been playing somebody within it. It was hard not to feel real empathy and deep appreciation and loyalty. So when suddenly they were dismissed and undermined by a president, it was just so hard to believe.\u201d",

This will apply to all registered charities, including those with a turnover of more than $1b.\nThe changes ease eligibility for not-for-profit services including childcare centres, and raised the hopes of the university sector they would also benefit.\nBut on Monday the assistant charities minister, Zed Seselja, clarified that non-government schools and universities will have to meet the higher threshold of a 30% downturn.\nPorter told reporters in Canberra the changes showed the government had \u201ctried to be as inclusive as possible\u201d but when it came to shorter term casuals missing out \u201cthere have to be some definitions and some lines drawn\u201d.\nAsked to confirm the government will not extend eligibility, Porter replied that the definition of \u201csystemic and regular employment with the same employer for a 12-month period\u201d is in the Fair Work Act. \u201cThat\u2019s the definition.\u201d\nPorter suggested casuals who miss out may not be much worse off because there is \u201cgoing to be an equivalence between a casual worker who would receive jobkeeper \u2026 and someone who would have to go on to the jobseeker payment but also has the capacity to pick up work as well\u201d.\nPorter said that some businesses \u201con the edge of viability can only afford to pay a worker the $1,500 jobkeeper amount\u201d.\n\u201cSo the structural problem that the legislation needs to deal with \u2026 [is that] unless we change the Fair Work Act, we cannot guarantee that a worker can lawfully work the right amount of hours for the $1,500 payment.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s bill, seen by the ACTU and soon to be sent to Labor ahead of debate and a vote on Wednesday, rectifies the situation by allowing employers to vary their employees\u2019 hours up or down to the number covered by the $1,500 at the regular rate of pay.\nPorter argued the alternative, changing 120 modern awards, would take \u201cweeks if not months\u201d to complete \u2013 although unions dispute this, citing the fact employers have nominated just 15 awards that must urgently change in their negotiations.\n\u201cI\u2019ve described it as $130bn worth of lifeboats going out,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThis is parliament\u2019s Dunkirk moment. We get the lifeboats out, and we save jobs, and we do it in the simplest, clearest guaranteed formula that parliament can devise.\u201d\nDominique Lamb, the National Retail Association chief executive officer, told Guardian Australia she supports unions\u2019 push to expand eligibility because \u201cif you\u2019re in employment you should be eligible for jobkeeper\u201d.\nLamb said the retail industry is diverse, with many entering the workforce without English as a first language, and her members had concerns that there was no safety net for temporary visa holders, many of whom had families that were not eligible for any type of welfare.\nIn addition to expanding eligibility to shorter term casuals and temporary visa-holders, Labor would prefer changes be implemented to awards rather than the Fair Work Act, to accommodate union concerns that employers not experiencing financial distress would seek to benefit by forcing workers to run down their leave and cutting their hours.\nBut on Monday the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, conceded he could not imagine any circumstances under which Labor would oppose the bill.\nBurke told reporters in Sydney that the Fair Work Commission could move at \u201clightning speed\u201d and the changes to hours would be \u201csimple and fast\u201d in most awards, while avoiding the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislative change.\nFor example, Burke suggested the system could be open to \u201cabuses\u201d such as an employer directing an employee whose regular hours did not amount to $1,500 in pay to then cook and clean at the employer\u2019s home.\nBurke \u2013 who has identified that millions of workers could be left without leave due to a loophole in jobkeeper \u2013 warned the payment was \u201cmeant to be a wage subsidy\u201d but on current drafting employers could \u201ctake it for themselves\u201d by using it to pay down accrued leave entitlements.\nEarlier, Porter sought to allay concern about the legislation, insisting the changes will only last for six months.\nHe also pointed to a \u201csecondary requirement about the viability of the business, and the necessity to give a direction around hours worked to save the job of the employee in question\u201d.\nPorter said the Fair Work Commission would be able to review an employer direction \u201cso that there will be safeguards in the process of trying to make the hours match the $1,500 payments\u201d.\nChildcare centres, non-government schools and private educational providers have emerged as potential winners from eligibility changes for charities.\nGoodstart Early Learning said it was \u201cvery relieved\u201d to learn that it was now eligible to apply for the $1,500 per fortnight subsidy for its staff.\n\u201cAccess to the jobkeeper payments is vital as it will ensure that we can trade through this very difficult time,\u201d the chief executive, Julia Davison, said in a statement.\nSeselja said the \u201c15% decline in the turnover threshold is aimed at charities like the Salvation Army and Catholic Social Services Australia\u201d.\n\u201cNon-government schools and universities are eligible for the jobkeeper payment.\n\u201cHowever, they will need to meet the turnover threshold of 30% for those with an annual turnover of less than $1 billion.\u201d",

        "content": "We are told by everyone from the United Nations to Donald Trump that the US is a \u2018developed\u2019 economy. The statistics suggest otherwise\nWhen Susan Finley developed flu-like symptoms, she didn\u2019t go to the doctor because she was frightened about the cost. Finley\u2019s grandparents later found her dead in her apartment. She was 53.\nFinley did not die as a result of Covid-19. She died in 2016 as a result of America\u2019s healthcare system \u2013 a system that led her to avoid treatment for the common flu in order to avoid debt. It is that same system that is currently creaking under the pressure of a pandemic that experts warned was coming but governments failed to prepare for. It is a system that does not qualify for the term \u201cdeveloped\u201d.\nThe United States of America, we are told by everyone from the president to the United Nations, is a developed economy. That term, \u201cdeveloped economy\u201d, sounds like an endpoint, like the man standing upright after a series of hunched and hairy iterations. It\u2019s the contrast that makes the definition \u2013 developed economies can only really exist if they are compared to their poorer \u201cdeveloping\u201d counterparts. Covid-19 has merely shown the cracks in a very successful marketing campaign about which category the US falls into.\nThere are 2.9 hospital beds for every 1,000 people in the United States. That\u2019s fewer than Turkmenistan (7.4 beds per 1,000), Mongolia (7.0), Argentina (5.0) and Libya (3.7). In fact, the US ranks 69th out of 182 countries analyzed by the World Health Organization. This lack of hospital beds is forcing doctors across the country to ration care under Covid-19, pushing up the number of preventable deaths.\nAmerica\u2019s numbers are similarly unimpressive when it comes to medical doctors. The United States has 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people, placing it behind Trinidad & Tobago (2.7), and Russia (4.0 doctors per 1,000, for a country that is described as being \u201cin transition\u201d). Life expectancies at birth are lower in the US than they are in Chile or China. The US has a higher maternal mortality rate than Iran or Saudi Arabia.\nIt\u2019s not just health. Access to the internet is better in Bahrain and Brunei (two countries the UN does not consider developed economies) than it is in the US. Inequality scores are higher in America than they are in Mali and Yemen. A closer country to America in inequality is Israel, a country which functions as an apartheid state.\nAnd the US ranks 81st in the world in terms of women\u2019s political representation. So, you\u2019ve got a better chance of making it into office as a woman if you live in Vietnam, or Albania. Sub-Saharan Africa is most comparable to America \u2013 24% of seats in the region\u2019s parliaments are held by women, the same figure as in the US.\nIn the United States, 83% of students graduate high school. That figure is higher in Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Barbados, Armenia, Bosnia & Herzegovina and Montenegro. None of those countries are considered \u201cdeveloped economies\u201d by the United Nations.\nSo why does the United Nations consider the US as a developed economy when its own statistics so clearly suggest otherwise? One might argue that it\u2019s about simple wealth, or gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the economy, per capita.\nBut if that were the measure of development then European countries such as Romania, Hungary and Slovakia should not qualify for the term \u201cdeveloped economy\u201d while Bermuda, Qatar, Singapore and China should all make the list. Besides, GDP per capita is no reliable measure of wellbeing in a country like the US where the richest 5% of people own two-thirds of the national wealth.\nThe facts are as exhaustive as they are exhausting. There\u2019s one simple conclusion from all of this. We\u2019ve been tricked. We\u2019ve been told that America, like most other majority-white countries, deserves the title \u201cdeveloped economy\u201d. It does not. You cannot charge a woman $39.95 to hold the baby that she has just given birth to. You cannot constantly operate hospitals at close to capacity in order to maximize profits. The pursuit of private money in systems built for public good has not worked ethically or practically.\nWhy does it matter whether a country is defined as developing or not? Because it means that policymakers here can distract voters into thinking that crises are constantly diplomatic, military or trade based when actually the problems that America needs to fix most urgently are right here \u2013 they\u2019re the crises of health and education. Had those problems been better addressed, the nation would not be struggling as desperately as it is right now.",

        "content": "The latest in our series of writers highlighting underappreciated films sees a recommendation for Robert Altman\u2019s dreamlike 70s horror \nWhen he completed Images, in 1971, Robert Altman thought to himself: \u201cEveryone is just going to flip over this film. It\u2019s going to be the greatest discovery since hash!\u201d As he later acknowledged, that did not turn out to be the case \u2013 to the extent that few people even remember Images today. Partly that\u2019s because this strange, elegant psychological horror doesn\u2019t feel like a Robert Altman film at all. Think of Altman and you think of his orchestrated ensemble pieces \u2013 Nashville, Short Cuts, The Player, Gosford Park \u2013 or his earlier, New Hollywood genre reinventions: McCabe And Mrs Miller or The Long Goodbye. Between those last two came Images, set in a remote Irish country house, and closer in spirit to Bergman\u2019s Persona or Polanski\u2019s Repulsion.\nImages takes us into the fractured psyche of Cathryn, a children\u2019s author played by Susannah York. We find her alone in her apartment, narrating passages from her new book \u2013 a fantasy tale of unicorns and magical lands with funny names (York actually wrote and published this book in real life). Late at night, Cathryn receives a phone call from a woman who sounds mysteriously like herself, informing her that her husband, Hugh, is with another woman. When Hugh (Altman regular Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois) returns he begins kissing Cathryn, but suddenly, he changes into another man, and Cathryn recoils, horrified. Deciding they need a break, they flee their chic city apartment and drive to their country house that night. But once there, things become ever stranger, as Cathryn struggles to separate illusion and reality.\nThe other man turns out to be Rene, Cathryn\u2019s former lover, who died three years ago. There is a third man, Marcel, a neighbour who also seems to have been Cathryn\u2019s lover at some point. Marcel has a teenage daughter (Cathryn Harrison, granddaughter of Rex), whom Cathryn takes under her wing, recognising something of herself in her \u2013 not a good sign under the circumstances. The identities of these three men seem to switch around, so we\u2019re never quite sure which one is which. She\u2019ll be talking to Rene one moment, but in the next shot, it\u2019s actually Hugh. To complicate matters further, Cathryn also sees another version of herself from time to time.\nDeepening her plight is the fact that all three men are, to some extent, assholes. Hugh in particular is a classic 70s man: patronising and insensitive, likes photography and shooting game, tells terrible jokes, wears driving gloves even when he\u2019s not driving. Rene seems intent on rekindling their relationship, despite being dead. And lecherous Marcel, who has recently separated from his wife, is constantly trying to grope her. You can hardly blame Cathryn for wanting to kill one or more of them, and let\u2019s just say there will be blood, but which one is which? Does it matter anyway?\nTrue to Altman\u2019s style, there\u2019s an unshowy, improvisatory naturalism to the performances. Despite being a man, Altman clearly identifies with his female lead, and York is magnificent, the cracks in her poised demeanour steadily widening as sexual guilt, male predation and mental illness take hold (she won best actress at Cannes for this performance). Added to which, her outfits are a 70s fashion style guide. But there\u2019s still a creepy, fairytale horror feel to the whole exercise. Vilmos Zsigmond\u2019s roving, impressionistic photography lends the film a dreamlike quality \u2013 all tinkling wind chimes and rain-streaked windows and fractured reflections, not to mention some rich exterior scenes in the autumnal Irish countryside. The score, too, is a strange mix of dissonant orchestral swells and percussive stabs. It was composed by John Williams, of all people, with help from Japanese prog musician Stomu Yamashta.\nDespite the Cannes award, the film received a mixed critical reception and had a botched release, which explains its relative obscurity. Altman himself judged the film to be a little heavy-handed in retrospect (he went on to rework similar themes in his better known 1977 movie Three Women), but Images stands up far better than most of its contemporaries. Not quite the greatest discovery since hash, but an intoxicating watch all the same.\nImages is available to stream on Amazon Prime in both the UK and US.",

        "content": "Continuing our series in which writers revisit childhood movie passions, we get back on the bus for an audaciously over-the-top thrill ride with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock\nThere was a heady point during the mid 1990s, when I was in my early teens, when the Speed VHS would be brought out at almost every sleepover, along with an argument over who was allowed to fancy Keanu Reeves the most for the duration of that particular screening. But on reflection, it does not seem strange that what was once a furious obsession eventually dulled to nothing: the prospect of finding escapist entertainment in the story of a bomb planted on a bus by an angry domestic terrorist has become less alluring as the years have gone on. (Keanu Reeves, by all accounts, has not.)\nIt has been 20 or so years since I last saw Speed, and it quickly became clear as I rewatched it that I had forgotten most of it. That says more about my teenage flightiness than it does the quality of the film, because it turns out that this is still a masterful and thrilling action movie. It ladles on the tension until it\u2019s brimming over, and then it keeps going, until you\u2019re losing your head. I have not felt so stressed out by a viewing experience since Uncut Gems. And the bomb-on-the-bus part is only the filling in the Speed sandwich. The bus section is bookended by the villain\u2019s even more dastardly plot to blow up a lift full of workers, and a full-on, all-out LA subway chase which is so ridiculous and over-the-top and unnecessary that having the audacity to tack it on to the end of the main chase is almost genius. This is certainly a showy film. You sense that the very idea of understatement was offensive to director Jan de Bont. When the passengers finally get off the bus safely, and you think that part is over, the bus drives itself into a plane and blows that up too. Just because, well, why not?\nI do not remember finding Speed scary or particularly gruesome as a teenager, but as an adult I can see it is clearly both, which makes me think I have grown into being a snowflake rather than out of it. Dennis Hopper plays evil ex-cop terrorist Howard Payne using every bit of his Hopper-ish anti-charm (\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with Daddy\u201d), and he begins the story by shoving a screwdriver into a poor security guard\u2019s ear. This is not the harmless sleepover fodder I expected. However, I winced to remember that Hopper\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cPop quiz, hotshot\u201d, did make its way into my own vocabulary for a while, for which I can only retrospectively apologise.\nAgainst Hopper\u2019s meaty acting, Reeves\u2019s deadened delivery is all the more stark, but that, too, is charming in its own way. I had not picked up on the fact that Reeves\u2019s LAPD hero Jack Traven is hungover when the bus fiasco kicks off. Not only does he save the bus and then a subway train, but he also falls in love with Sandra Bullock\u2019s Annie, who jokingly tells him they should base their entire relationship on sex. Just to reiterate: he is hungover for the whole thing.\nSpeed is a brilliant blast of adrenaline that is as extravagantly fun now as it was then. Jeff Daniels is excellent as Jack\u2019s doomed colleague Harry; Bullock really set the template for the kind of quippy role she would become famous for; and everyone\u2019s favourite presidential wannabe, Succession\u2019s Connor Roy (Alan Ruck), shows up as a naive visitor to LA who gets more than the bus ride he bargained for. Pop quiz, asshole: who knew Speed would hold up so well?\n This article was amended on 6 April 2020. An earlier version mistakenly said \u201cJeff Bridges is excellent as Jack\u2019s doomed colleague Mac\u201d. This was initially corrected to name the right actor, Jeff Daniels, and then later to correct the character Daniels played, Harry.",

        "content": "Musicians drive around Budapest playing \u2018uplifting\u2019 classics from loudspeakers\nOver the past week, Attila Kov\u00e1cs has been playing music to entertain the residents of Budapest, just as he has done for more than three decades as a viola player in the city\u2019s MAV symphony orchestra.\nThese days, however, the orchestra\u2019s \u201cperformances\u201d look rather different from usual. Hungary, like almost every other country in Europe, has banned large gatherings of people because of the coronavirus crisis, making live concerts impossible.\nMany orchestras and opera houses have instead taken to streaming archive performances online, but the MAV orchestra has drawn on its unique, itinerant history to take things a step further.\nEvery day, musicians from the orchestra drive two cars mounted with loudspeakers around Budapest and its surroundings, belting out recordings of past performances. It is currently forbidden to leave the house except for essential activities in Hungary, but the idea is that people should open up their windows or step on to their balconies and enjoy an uplifting blast of classical music.\n\u201cIt seems like we managed to make many generations very happy with playing music, even in these weird, stressful times,\u201d said Kov\u00e1cs, who said that while pensioners formed the majority of the audience, in recent days young people too had been enjoying the music.\n\u201cPeople came out to the streets, keeping the proper distance between each other, and started to clap and give us a thumbs up. Some of them were even dancing,\u201d he said.\nThe reaction over the past week has been almost universally positive, said K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, a trumpeter in the orchestra who has been driving one of the cars. An elderly woman conducted from her balcony, a trio of young foreigners danced \u201cas though they were in a nightclub\u201d to a Strauss waltz, and a truck driver wound down his window and asked for the volume to be increased as cyclists stopped to listen.\nThere was only one negative reaction, a woman who raced angrily on to the street to shout that her child was sleeping and they should turn the music off immediately.\nThe music selection changes daily, but is always drawn from recordings of the orchestra and there is an emphasis on light and uplifting music. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be playing the Shostakovich Leningrad symphony,\u201d joked Gy\u00f6rgy Lendvai, the orchestra\u2019s managing director. If people want to request an appearance near their homes, they can message the orchestra\u2019s Facebook account with their address.\nLendvai said the idea came from the orchestra\u2019s unique history as the house ensemble of MAV, the Hungarian railway network. It was set up at the end of the second world war by the music-loving head of the state railway concern, who felt music was essential to lift the people\u2019s spirits in the ruins of postwar Hungary.\nIt was initially a brass and wind ensemble, and later it became a full orchestra. With communist rule firmly entrenched, it became an arm of the Soviet ideal of bringing high culture to the masses, and was the orchestra for the so-called \u201crolling opera\u201d which took operatic performances to the provinces. For the first decade, the orchestra performed in navy-blue railway uniforms.\nThe railway provided the orchestra with three coaches: one for male musicians, one for female musicians and one for the instruments and props. Most weeks for several decades, the orchestra would leave Budapest for the provinces and perform symphonic concerts and operas in small towns or sometimes even in factories, before returning to sleep in the railway carriages and then moving on to the next destination. On Fridays, the orchestra would be back in Budapest and perform in the opulent surroundings of the city\u2019s Liszt Academy.\n\u201cEven now, when I\u2019m in the smallest village in the countryside and say I work for the MAV orchestra, there will always be someone elderly who says: \u2018Oh, that orchestra was the first time I ever heard classical music or the opera,\u2019\u201d said Lendvai.\nAfter the fall of communism, the orchestra began to travel more abroad, but it is still partially funded by Hungarian railways, and it was this history that formed the basis for the current idea of bringing music to residents on lockdown.\n\u201cToday we have a crisis and I think people need to be cheered up and given a little hope,\u201d said Lendvai. \u201cBut right now we cannot do it with an orchestra. So we thought that we could bring music by car to all the people in quarantine in their home.\u201d",

        "content": "In county where every child qualifies for free school meals, a superintendent embarks on a project \u2013 driving 6,000 meals a day\nOn the cracked country roads of Lexington, deep in the Mississippi delta, an empty yellow school bus drives slowly, making life-sustaining drop-offs on the way.\nHere, in the poorest county, in America\u2019s poorest state, the coronavirus has yet to ravage the jurisdiction with infection. There has been one recorded Covid-19 death in the county, Clinton Cobbins, Lexington\u2019s first African American mayor. But even now the coronavirus still poses a serious threat to life.\nIn Holmes county consolidated \u2013 the school district to which Lexington belongs \u2013 every single child qualifies for free school meals, a marker of pervasive poverty. For many, said the superintendent, Dr James L Henderson, breakfast and lunch at school are the only nutritious meals a student will eat in a day. For a few, they are the only meals.\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic led to statewide school closures, Henderson, who was born in the county, left for most of his adult life, but returned in 2018 to assume his position, was left with a significant dilemma: how to feed the 3,000 children under his authority.\nMany children in this rural district come from households too poor to afford a car. So the superintendent embarked on an improvised project, driving 6,000 meals a day out across the county in a small fleet of 70 school buses, dropping each packet off at a stop along the route.\n\u201cWe absolutely see this as a matter of life and death,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to do it on behalf of our children. It\u2019s just that simple. Families are suffering here.\u201d\n\u201cIf there is a silver lining to Covid-19, even in the poorest county in the poorest state, we genuinely care about each other. We are working to that end to make sure we\u2019re providing for all children.\nThe novel strategy underlines the escalating crisis the coronavirus has imposed on Mississippi, America\u2019s most food-insecure state. In Holmes county 35% of residents are already food-insecure, according to recent research and that number is certain to rise substantially as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold.\nAs the yellow school bus pulled into one driveway, nine-year-old Keizarrian Thomas dashed from his porch and collected three lunch packages \u2013 two for his brothers. A juice box, three celery sticks and a ham sandwich in each.\nHis mother, Felichia Walden, had just been furloughed from her job at a local car company because of the virus.\n\u201cWith the money that we do have we\u2019ve got to try and pay the bills,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you go to the grocery store you can hardly get things.\u201d\nAt the next stop, a few hundred feet down the street, Arletha Gaston took four meals for her children who sat on the stoop of their trailer home, playing tag in the morning sun.\nHow to help\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u00a0\nAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.\nDonate money or supplies\nThe Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.\nIf you want to help,\u00a0find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America\u2019s Covid-19 response fund.\nVolunteers\nFood banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u00a0Feeding America\u2019s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you\u2019re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, \u201cstay home\u201d is the advice.\nSocial media\nFeeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.\n\u201cThis is getting so much harder,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get out of town to look for better deals on food.\u201d\nHolmes county, with a population of 18,000 people, has only two fresh grocery stores and both face allegations of price gouging during the pandemic.\nZelpha Whatley, who hosts a weekly local call-in radio show, said countless listeners, many of whom receive food stamps to purchase their basic groceries, had complained on her show about rising prices \u2013 in some instances tripling or quadrupling the price.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe these two stores would take advantage of the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I went to one to check myself. When I saw the price of eggs had doubled, I walked out and said \u2018I\u2019m not paying\u2019. My brain just melted because I was so upset.\u201d\nIn a brief phone interview the owner of Lexington\u2019s only grocery store, Roy Sims, denied he had inflated prices for profit, arguing produce, including eggs, dairy and meat, had risen at wholesale. Sims declined to cite specific margins.\n\u201cIf people have a problem they should report it to the attorney general of Mississippi,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking to anyone else about price gouging.\u201d\nMississippi may still be at the early stage of the pandemic compared with other hotspots in the US \u2013 particularly neighbouring Louisiana. Thirty-five people have died of Covid-19 here with 1,455 cases statewide. But the state already has the highest rate of hospitalizations due to coronavirus, according to analysis by Mississippi Today.\nAs the school bus food drop-offs concluded their lunchtime run last Wednesday, the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, announced a state-wide shelter in place order, after days of criticism his administration had been too slow to act.\n\u201cI pray that all of our orders and preparations will be enough. We believe that this is the right tool at the right time to save lives,\u201d Reeves said.\nBut the virus has already amplified food insecurity across Mississippi, not just in Holmes county.\n\u201cHunger is rampant here,\u201d said Charles Beadie, CEO of the Mississippi Food Network, the only in-state foodbank that distributes to 415 agencies. \u201cSix hundred thousand were already going to bed hungry or not knowing how they will get their meal.\u201d\nThe network is under major pressure in the first few weeks of the crisis. A number of agencies have closed down due to volunteers being afraid of infection. At least one county in the state now has no access to food bank resources. The network is chronically understaffed and free labor from the state\u2019s prison network is no longer available due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, demand has surged.\n\u201cWe have more phone calls than we can handle,\u201d Beadie said, acknowledging his organization was struggling to quantify the increased scale of demand.\nIn Jackson, the state\u2019s capital city, volunteers have begun running hot meal services to some of the city\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods.\nLike Holmes county and dozens of other districts in the state, every child in Jackson qualifies for free school meals. And while the school district continues to offer a pickup meal service there are no drop-offs here.\nApril Jackson, a 30-year-old mother of seven, has no car and said she had been unable to pick up meals for her children provided by the school.\nVolunteers from the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, and Operation Good \u2013 a local collective of activists \u2013 have been organizing hot food drop-offs at this low-income apartment complex, for the past week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a scavenger hunt,\u201d Jackson said as residents queued for handouts. \u201cPeople are going crazy and everyone is on the hunt for food.\u201d\nShe lost her part-time job this week at a school cafeteria and is now completely reliant on handouts and food stamps to feed her family. She received $278 in weekly food benefits before the crisis and had expected more after the state announced an increase in emergency benefits to families. She said she got just $6 more.\n\u201cI just took it,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought a block of cheese. That was it.\u201d",

In a Daily Beast op-ed last year, Gavin De Becker, Bezos\u2019s top security consultant, said he believed that Michael Sanchez had played a relatively minor role in the Enquirer\u2019s story, and compared him to a \u201clow-level Watergate burglar\u201d.\n\u201cReality is complicated, and can\u2019t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like \u2018the brother did it,\u2019 even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid,\u201d De Becker wrote.\nIt is still far from clear how the supermarket tabloid landed its scoop, and how it obtained information about some \u201cbelow the belt\u201d photographs Bezos sent to Lauren Sanchez while their relationship was still secret.\nThe Guardian reported in January that Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, had his mobile phone \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe matter is under investigation by experts at the United Nations. Saudi Arabia has denied it hacked Bezos.\nIn his lawsuit, Michael Sanchez admits having played a role in the Enquirer story, and claims to have done so \u201cstrategically\u201d to minimise fallout for his sister and control the \u201cnarrative\u201d of the story. While he has not denied supplying the tabloid with some of the couple\u2019s private texts , he has denied the allegation that he ever gave AMI sexually explicit photographs.\nThose photographs have never been published, but Bezos referred to them in an extraordinary blogpost statement on the matter in February 2019, a few weeks after the Enquirer story was published. Bezos claimed in the post that he was the victim of an extortion attempt by AMI.\nThe billionaire executive also published emails from AMI executives which he claimed showed the company threatening to publish sexually explicit photographs \u2013 which it described in detail \u2013 if Bezos did not publicly state that he had \u201cno knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI\u2019s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces\u201d.\nAt the time Bezos said he had decided to publish the AMI emails \u201cdespite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten\u201d.\nIn his lawsuit, Michael Sanchez described himself as his sister\u2019s \u201cprimary confidant and advisor\u201d when he learned about her relationships with Bezos in March 2018. He said he was introduced to Bezos a month later over dinner, and said he had immediately \u201chit it off\u201d with the billionaire.\nA preliminary investigation that was commissioned by the Amazon CEO found that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that an intrusion into Bezos\u2019s mobile phone was triggered after an infected video file was sent to him over WhatsApp from the account of the Saudi crown prince on 1 May 2018.\nIn his lawsuit, Sanchez has alleged that he was first contacted by the Enquirer about his sister\u2019s affair with Bezos in July 2018, and has claimed \u201con information and belief\u201d that AMI was \u201calready in possession of raunchy text messages and nude selfies exchanged\u201d between Lauren Sanchez and Bezos.\nSanchez also referred in his lawsuit to a cryptic email he said was sent by Dylan Howard, AMI\u2019s vice-president, dated 22 January 2019. A person close to the matter said it was a response to a previous email from Sanchez about the Bezos story, which had been published a few weeks earlier.\n\u201cThe untold story \u2013 if you will \u2013 has not been told as to how we uncovered the story. I\u2019m saving it for my tombstone,\u201d Howard wrote in the email, according to Sanchez\u2019s legal filing.\nIn a statement, AMI denied Sanchez\u2019s allegations. \u201cThe fact, as we have maintained throughout, is that Mr Sanchez sold the National Enquirer the story about his sister\u2019s secret affair and was the sole source for its reporting. His frivolous lawsuit underscores what his true motivation is, his own greed,\u201d the company said.\nAMI did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Howard\u2019s email or what the executive was referring to.\nAn attorney representing Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.",

        "content": "The House Is Black is a poetic documentary classic from 1962 all about social isolation and illness and their disproportionate effects on the dispossessed\nIn the autumn of 1962, the celebrated Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad made what would be her first and last film. Regarded as a precursor to the Iranian new wave and now considered a classic, The House Is Black is a documentary about the members of a leper colony near the city of Tabriz in northwest Iran. Despite having been filmed nearly 60 years ago, and focusing on a small group of people suffering from a particular condition, it has found new relevance in the age of the coronavirus pandemic, having much to say not only about the current situation in Iran but also to those in self-isolation and/or suffering, regardless of location.\nFarrokhzad\u2019s short film is anything but an easy watch. Ebrahim Golestan, its producer (who was in a secret relationship with Farrokhzad at the time) states this explicitly at the start. \u201cOn this screen,\u201d he says, \u201cwill appear an image of ugliness, a vision of pain no caring human being should ignore.\u201d This echoes the sentiments of the poet Sa\u2019di of Shiraz, who in the 13th century famously declared: \u201cYou who are indifferent to the misery of others cannot be called a human being.\u201d\nGolestan\u2019s \u201cugliness\u201d, however, turns out to be something of a euphemism. While some of Farrokhzad\u2019s subjects are being treated for leprosy at an early stage, others haven\u2019t been as fortunate. In the first scene, a girl regards what is exposed of her mutilated face in a mirror. Elsewhere a blind, noseless man handles a cigarette with mere stubs for fingers. Farrokhzad does not, however, treat any of them as anomalies or grotesques but as people; and her empathy is accentuated by her passionate readings of her poetry. \u201cLet us listen to the soul,\u201d she says, \u201cwho sings in the remote desert, the one who sighs and stretches his hands out, saying, \u2018Alas, my wounds have numbed my spirit.\u2019\u201d\nIn his preface, Golestan says that the motive and hope of the film is \u201cto wipe out this ugliness and relieve the victims\u201d; but The House Is Black is a little more complex than that. According to Nasrin Rahimieh, professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Farrokhzad told Bernardo Bertolucci that \u201cshe saw the leper colony as an example or a model of a world imprisoned by its illnesses, difficulties, and poverty\u201d. Rahimieh suggests that \u201clife in the leper colony is a metaphor for life in general\u201d. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian studies and comparative literature at Columbia University, and Roxanne Varzi, a professor of anthropology and film at the University of California, suggest, respectively, that the film reflects the \u201cbrutalised history\u201d of Iran, and serves as a metaphor for \u201cthe Shah\u2019s oppressive social policies and a critique of the practice of religion at the time\u201d.\nThe House Is Black has taken on even more meaning in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. For one, it can make those self-isolating appreciate what they have. Our pandemic will pass, but for the quarantined patients in the film, especially those with advanced leprosy, illness and isolation from the rest of society are facts of life. They have no recovery to look forward to, passing out their days in a slow decay. \u201cI am poured out like water \u2026 as those who have long been dead,\u201d Farrokhzad says in her voiceover. \u201cOn my eyelids is the shadow of death.\u201d\nThat said, there is some light in the film: children giggle at school and while playing football, dealing with the situation as best they can, while other patients are shown making merry at a wedding. The film\u2019s contrasting of scenes in a hospital in which Golestan discusses the treatment of leprosy, with those of fatalistic worshippers submitting to the will of God in a mosque, says volumes about the conflicting attitudes of and towards science and religion in Iran.\nOn that note, the \u201chouse\u201d in the film (ie, the colony) can certainly stand as a metaphor for coronavirus-era Iran: a pariah nation battling a pandemic under crippling US sanctions costing ordinary Iranians their lives at an alarming rate. In perhaps the film\u2019s most harrowing scene, a schoolboy is asked to write a sentence on the blackboard with the word \u201chouse\u201d. He thinks to himself before scrawling with his damaged fingers: \u201cThe house is black.\u201d",

I\u2019m sure he is going to be fine. He\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, both wished Johnson a speedy recovery while the former prime minister Tony Blair, who was hospitalised himself briefly in 2003 to correct an abnormal heart rhythm during his premiership, said Johnson\u2019s hospital situation must be \u201chellish\u201d.\nBlair told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI have every sympathy and solidarity with him. I know it must be a hellish situation to be in.\u201d\nThere were also messages of support from the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran and the Labour backbencher David Lammy, one of Johnson\u2019s fiercest critics, who said: \u201cThe whole country wants you to return to full health as soon as possible.\u201d\nGet well soon @BorisJohnson. The whole country wants you to return to full health as soon as possible. https://t.co/LvvRBMDJVd\nThere were also calls for Johnson to reflect on his health and take time out from Downing Street if necessary rather than soldier on.\nThe former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake said it would be \u201csensible\u201d for Boris Johnson to \u201cstep back\u201d if he was not well enough to carry out his role for now.\nHe told the Today programme: \u201cI think in the end if he\u2019s not well, he will have to reflect on this because the job\u2019s tough at the best of times and it\u2019s doubly tough now.\u201d\nMichael Gove\u2019s wife, the Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, suggested Johnson\u2019s failure to shake off the virus was linked to his commitment to continue leading the nation\u2019s battle against the virus. \u201cBoris has worked non-stop throughout his illness \u2013 and now we see the result,\u201d she tweeted.\nBoris has worked non-stop throughout his illness - and now we see the result.\nAsked whether Johnson should hand over control during his illness, Blair said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to second guess them on that.\n\u201cHe knows the state of his own condition and he will be judging it carefully himself, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said the prime minister\u2019s admission to hospital had been a precautionary move taken \u201con the advice of his doctor\u201d because he had continued to have \u201cpersistent symptoms\u201d 10 days after testing positive for the virus.\nJohnson tested positive last month along with Matt Hancock, who has recovered. His chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, also self-isolated.\nJohnson\u2019s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.\nFrom an apartment above 11 Downing Street, and with food brought to his door, Johnson continued to lead the government\u2019s response and chaired meetings via video conference.\nHe has posted a series of video messages since then, initially appearing in a suit and tie, but in the latest post on Friday he appeared weary, sitting in a chair with his shirt open at the neck.\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m feeling better and I\u2019ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,\u201d he said.\nThe pound briefly fell 0.4% against the US dollar to $1.2215 on the news before trimming some losses to trade at $1.2230, down 0.3%.",

Plus: Russia refuses to cancel parade of 15,000 troops despite infection fears\nGood morning, I\u2019m Molly Blackall with today\u2019s essential stories.\nThe US surgeon general warned on Sunday that the country was approaching a \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d moment, as the country braces for unprecedented numbers of coronavirus deaths. Jerome Adams told NBC News\u2019s Meet the Press that the next week was \u201cgoing to be our Pearl Harbor moment. It\u2019s going to be our 9/11 moment.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, had a similar message, saying: \u201cThis is probably going to be a very bad week.\u201d\nThe warnings came as news broke that the navy captain who was removed from his post and criticised by Donald Trump after he wrote a letter raising his concerns for the health of his crew had tested positive for coronavirus. Brett Crozier, who was cheered by sailors as he left his ship, had pleaded with the US navy for more resources to enable his crew to self-isolate, after coronavirus broke out onboard. Trump fired Crozier after describing his decision to write the letter as \u201cterrible\u201d.\nEurope. The falling coronavirus numbers in Europe offer hope for the US as it prepares for the challenge of the coming weeks, with France, Italy and Spain reporting a decline in deaths or cases.\nFollow state-by-state developments with our US coronavirus map.\nDr Anthony Fauci contradicted Donald Trump yet again in the White House briefing on Sunday, when he warned that there was no scientific evidence to suggest that the anti-malaria drug the president has been promoting can act as a remedy to coronavirus. This is the second time Fauci has spoken against the effectiveness of the drug, despite Trump telling citizens in the White House briefing on Sunday to \u201ctake it. What do you have to lose?\u201d\nJared Kushner. Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law is leading \u201ca shadow taskforce\u201d in a post created for him in the Federal Emergency Management Agency, working with private companies to obtain medical equipment and assessing requests from governors for aid. Critics wonder why he has been given the role, and what this means for Trump\u2019s governance.\nArnold Schwarzenegger has launched a range of T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his coronavirus slogan \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass, stay inside\u201d, to raise money for disadvantaged families hit by the pandemic.\n\n  The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spent a night in hospital after showing coronavirus symptoms for more than 10 days. While 10 Downing Street insisted the move was purely precautionary, it has been seen as a sign that his illness has escalated, and brought his ability to continue leading the country into question. Despite this, a senior minister has insisted Johnson can run the country from his hospital bed.\nBangladesh. The Bangladeshi government has begun sending emergency food and aid to tens of thousands of women working in the country\u2019s sex trade, as the industry shuts down due to coronavirus.\nRussia has resisted calls to cancel its Victory Day parade in early May, and has been continuing rehearsals with 15,000 soldiers, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Putin is set to welcome the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in the military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war, in what is pegged as an opportunity to demonstrate that Putin is no longer politically isolated from the west.\nWet markets. The UN\u2019s biodiversity chief has called for the closure of \u201cwet markets\u201d, selling live and dead animals. A wet market in Wuhan, China, is thought to be the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, and similar markets around the country have already been temporarily banned.\nCoronavirus around the world. Our world map shows where coronavirus has spread, and where it is most deadly.\nThe US inspector general of the intelligence community who was fired by Donald Trump after sparking the impeachment process has encouraged other inspectors general to speak out against misconduct. Michael Atkinson said he was \u201cdisappointed and saddened\u201d at his ousting on Friday, which he thought derived from having \u201cfaithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial inspector general\u201d, but pleaded with other inspectors general not to allow \u201crecent events to silence\u201d them.\nThe alleged source of the National Enquirer\u2019s 2019 exclusive on the affair of the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, has launched a lawsuit against the publication, raising further questions about how the story was obtained. Michael Sanchez, brother of Bezos\u2019s girlfrien,d Lauren Sanchez, was reportedly paid $200,000 for intimate information about the extramarital relationship, which led to Bezos\u2019s multibillion-dollar divorce from his wife. In a new lawsuit, Michael Sanchez claims he was scapegoated and alleges that the Enquirer used other sources including hacking Bezos\u2019s phone.\nRadiation near to the site of Chernobyl, where the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident took place, has increased to 16 times above normal after a forest fire in the area. The fire, which broke out on Saturday, has spread to 100 hectares of forest, and caused the Ukrainian government to scramble more than 100 firefighters to the blaze.\nA Frenchman has been found freezing and exhausted in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es after setting off across the mountain range to buy cheap cigarettes from Spain. The man had intended to drive from his home in the south of France but was stopped at a police checkpoint and turned back, so instead decided to walk. He was found by mountain rescue teams after phoning for help, and given a \u20ac135 ($166) fine for breakdown lockdown regulations.\nCoronavirus reveals the flaws in the US economy\nThe US has fewer hospital beds per person than Turkmenistan, Mongolia and Libya, and more students graduate high school in Belarus and Armenia, finds Mona Chalabi, as she explores what the coronavirus pandemic has revealed about the American economy. Meanwhile, in America\u2019s poorest county of Lexington, Mississippi, Oliver Laughland speaks to those impacted by the mounting food crisis caused by coronavirus.\nClaire Danes on the end of Homeland\nAs the 10-year run of CIA drama comes to a close, Claire Danes speaks to David Smith about spy camps, Islamophobia and what Homeland reveals about the US.\nThrough the keyhole\nFrom couples who\u2019ve split up but are confined to the same flat, to those who\u2019ve inadvertently read about their own infidelity, Elle Hunt looks at the Instagram project documenting the domestic dramas of life in lockdown.\nLockdown literature\nTwenty-five novelists, from Hilary Mantel to Mark Haddon, choose their favourite books to escape with during the coronavirus lockdown.

        "content": "From how to tell if you have Covid-19 to how to protect others - our experts answer the questions that really matter\nCovid-19 is the illness caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family that has transferred from animals to humans. The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.\nAbout 80% of people experience a mild case and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people become seriously ill.\nWash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds each time, and use hand sanitiser gel. Catch coughs and sneezes with a disposable tissue and bin the tissue. If you don\u2019t have a tissue available, cough and sneeze into the crook of your arm. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\nDifferent countries have set different rules, but broadly speaking, if you live alone and develop a new continuous cough or a high temperature it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days. Studies show that people have the coronavirus without symptoms for five days on average.\nThe infection may spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period. Check with your local medical authorities for specific advice that may be applied in your area.\nMany authorities are asking people to practise social and physical distancing. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family who don\u2019t live with you. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. In some places, you can go out for a walk for exercise and to buy essentials, but stay two metres apart from others. Check with local authorities for specific rules that may be applied in your area.\nKeep the patient rested and comfortable in loose-fitting clothing, keep the room where they are well ventilated, and ensure they drink plenty of water. Over-the counter pain relief may be helpful \u2013 but paracetamol (Tylenol) is recommended rather than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil).\nTo prevent the coronavirus spreading within the household, if possible keep the patient in their own separate room and using a separate bathroom. They should have separate cutlery, crockery, bedding and towels, and preferably wear a mask. Regularly clean and disinfect high-frequency touch surfaces in the home such as door handles, toilets, kitchen counters and tabletops. Everybody in the house should be washing their hands frequently.\nPeople with diabetes or heart disease are known to be at greater risk from coronavirus. The over-70s and pregnant women are also considered to be at higher risk. Men also seem more likely to die than women.\nFind out more: Why are some people are at greater risk from coronavirus?\nThe coronavirus has spread to more than 150 countries. See the global map of confirmed cases or how many confirmed cases there are in your area in the UK or a map of the latest cases state by state in the US.\nMany countries have imposed travel bans, closed schools and introduced curfews and lockdown conditions to try to halt the spread of the disease.\nIn the UK there is a set of lockdown conditions to limit the movement of people. Schools are closed except to the children of a defined government list of key workers. All non-essential travel is discouraged, and there are a list of government travel warnings about visiting the rest of the world.\nThere is no test to tell. Scientists are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren\u2019t ready for clinical use. The only definitive way to know that you\u2019ve had it is to test positive for it while you have it.\nFind out more: Have I already had the coronavirus?\nTo some extent, yes, but not completely. Masks are effective at capturing droplets, a main transmission route of coronavirus. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. However, masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town, and are no guarantee of protection. Medical staff working with Covid-19 patients have been catching the virus despite all the protective equipment they have at their disposal.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours. But it\u2019s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.\nFind out more: How long does coronavirus live on different surfaces?\nReassuringly for parents, the disease has generally been milder in children, though they can spread it without displaying any symptoms. There are many unknowns, and research is continuing.\nFind out more: What we know so far about kids and the coronavirus\nWith many children around the world suddenly taken out of school, it can be a worrying and bewildering time for them.\nFind out more from experts: How to talk to your children about the coronavirus\nThe coronavirus is a strip of ribonucleic acid inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell\u2019s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. The spikes latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than those on the related Sars coronavirus. This suggests that coronavirus particles inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, meaning relatively few are needed for an infection to gain a foothold.\nFind out more: Study sheds light on coronavirus infection mechanism\nThe cough and fever is a result of the infection reaching the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. The lining of the air passages become injured, causing inflammation. The inflammation can spread throughout the lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, making breathing difficult. The lungs are then unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, which can cause death.\nFind out more: What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus?\nThe first recorded case of the coronavirus is believed to have emerged in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Many of those first affected had worked in or visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the city of 11 million people.\nYes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that made the leap from animals to humans. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.\nIt is probably about or a bit less than 1%. The rate appears to be as high as 4% from globally confirmed case figures, but it is likely that many mild cases are going undetected. However a 1% mortality rate would still make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. The death rate also increases significantly for people over 60.\nA pandemic is declared by WHO when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads in multiple countries simultaneously. Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of the disease or how dangerous it is.\nFind out more: What is a pandemic?\nCurrently there is no cure or vaccine for the coronavirus. Human trials are under way \u2013 but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be considered quick.\nFind out more: When will a coronavirus vaccine will be ready?\nThere\u2019s little evidence that domestic pets can catch the coronavirus, but contact between them and an infected person may help transmit the virus. It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after coming into contact with any animal.\nPeople are being bombarded with new information at a time of heightened stress and it\u2019s playing damaging games with our decision making. So how do we decide what\u2019s good information and what isn\u2019t?\nFind out more: Fighting misinformation\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

        "content": "Judge makes major ruling in mass \u2018dieselgate\u2019 litigation against VW in England and Wales\nThe car manufacturer Volkswagen subverted key air pollution tests, a British court has found, by using special software to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides under test conditions.\nThe high court finding is a boost to attempts by campaigners to force the company to address the impact of its cars in producing lung-damaging pollutants at far higher levels than were legally permissible.\nA group of about 91,000 claimants is taking Volkswagen to court in one of the biggest \u201cclass action\u201d cases, or group litigation orders, yet to be heard in England and Wales. Although Volkswagen has been found guilty in the US, in Europe the carmaker has denied that it cheated tests.\nThe preliminary finding in the case on Monday, by Mr Justice Waksman, casts a fresh light on the activities of the carmaker, first revealed in the \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal of 2015.\nIn his summary, the judge wrote: \u201c[After considering the arguments made by Volkswagen] the upshot was that I found that the software function in the vehicles here did indeed amount to a prohibited \u2018defeat device\u2019\u2026 I also concluded that VW\u2019s attempt to relitigate the issue here was an abuse of the process.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cA software function which enables a vehicle to pass the test because (artificially) it operates the vehicle in a way which is bound to pass the test and in which it does not operate on the road is a fundamental subversion of the test \u2026 it destroys the utility of the test.\u201d\nDiesel vehicles were once touted by the car industry as a green alternative to petrol vehicles because they have lower greenhouse gas emissions. But their emissions of tiny particles and irritant gases such as nitrogen dioxide are far higher, unless trapped by filters.\nIn 2015, campaigners revealed that cars produced by Volkswagen emitted far more nitrogen oxides in standard road driving than was recorded in test conditions. The ensuing scandal engulfed the car industry, which has faced turmoil and falling sales in some categories.\nThe revelations also highlighted rampant air pollution around the world, which is estimated to cause as many as 800,000 premature deaths every year in Europe alone.\nIn the UK, the sale of new diesel and petrol cars is to be banned from 2035, in an effort to clear up dangerous air and reduce the impact of road transport on the climate crisis.\nJenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cDiesel exhaust is in the same category for causing cancer as smoking, according to the World Health Organization, so to deliberately hide this toxicity cannot go unnoticed or indeed unpunished. The sale of all diesel and petrol cars and vans should be banned by 2030, earlier than the government is planning, both for air pollution and climate reasons.\u201d\nVolkswagen is now likely to continue to a full trial of liability for the claims of deceit. The claimants argue that they were sold vehicles that were represented as being compliant with emissions regulations, when they did not comply.\nA spokesperson for Volkswagen Group told the Guardian: \u201cThe judgment relates only to preliminary issues [and] does not determine liability or any issues of causation or loss for any of the causes of action claimed. These remain to be determined by the court as the case continues.\n\u201cVolkswagen remains confident in our case that we are not liable to the claimants as alleged and the claimants did not suffer any loss. We will continue to defend our position robustly. Nothing in this decision today changes this.\u201d\nThe group litigation order in the UK is brought against Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat, the Volkswagen financial services arm, and various authorised dealers, by owners and lessees of cars under these brands which used a particular Volkswagen diesel engine.\nIn the US, Volkswagen has paid out $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) in civil and criminal penalties since pleading guilty more than two years ago to criminal charges based on deceit. Global costs are thought to have reached at least $21bn.\nGareth Pope, who leads the legal team at the Slater and Gordon law firm, representing 70,000 claimants, said: \u201cThis damning judgment confirms what our clients have known for a long time but Volkswagen has refused to accept: that Volkswagen fitted defeat devices into millions of vehicles in the UK in order to cheat emissions tests.\n\u201cThe court\u2019s conclusion that the existence of software was a \u2018fundamental subversion\u2019 of tests designed to limit pollution and make our air safe to breath exposes VW\u2019s disregard for EU emissions regulations and public health, in pursuit of profit and market dominance.\u201d",

        "content": "On a wild Thursday night, the Blades fell 2-0 down in the first half before staging a Paul Peschisolido-inspired fightback\nThere are moments in football fandom that, in retrospect, you realise were the emotional high-water mark. The time when it mattered that much more, when the blade, now long dulled by experience, cut right through to the core. For me, that peak came at Bramall Lane on 15 May 2003.\nIn truth I can\u2019t recall much about events surrounding the game. Googling the date today reveals \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 that it was a Thursday. So I must have got the train up from London where I was at university. My dad would\u2019ve driven up from Derby with my brother, uncle and cousin, parking up near Heeley city farm in an awkward traffic-bothering style that had long been known as \u201cthe Manoeuvre\u201d. At that time my uncle\u2019s superstition was, I think, at the everybody-has-to-have-a-lucky-mint stage.\nAnd that season the mints had been working wonders. Neil Warnock\u2019s cobbled-together Blades had reached the League Cup semi\u2011finals (losing against Liverpool over two legs), the FA Cup semi\u2011finals (losing against Arsenal at Old Trafford) and finished (a pretty distant) third in the First Division behind a very useful Leicester and a cracking Portsmouth side.\nAnd it had all come from nowhere. Warnock, in his fourth season at Bramall Lane, had done a decent job of keeping the club competitive in the division on a shoestring budget and had reforged a connection with the fans. This was a side of dogged old pros and free transfers buoyed by a pair of terrific youngsters (Phil Jagielka and Michael Tonge) and a midfielder having the season of his life. In Michael Brown\u2019s 650-game career he scored 58 goals \u2013 22 of them came in that campaign alone.\nThe semi-final first leg, at the City Ground, had finished 1-1 \u2013 Forest\u2019s David Johnson (another player on a never-to-be-repeated season\u2011long goal spree) opening the scoring, Brown equalising from the spot \u2013 so the advantage lay with Warnock\u2019s side as they emerged with the packed Kop bathed in late\u2011spring evening sunshine.\nAt first it all went horribly wrong. Thirty minutes in John Curtis\u2019s miscued clearance fell straight to Johnson, who thundered the ball past Paddy Kenny. Thirteen minutes into the second half Andy Reid volleyed home to make it 2-0. Semi-final heartache was on the cards once more.\nBut seconds later (Sky Sports was still showing replays of Reid\u2019s goal) Des Walker tripped Carl Asaba on the edge of the box. Brown\u2019s free-kick deflected past Darren Ward in the Forest goal: 2-1. Then came Steve Kabba. Kenny, genuinely an early, glitchy version of a sweeper-keeper, booted long; Kabba flicked the bouncing ball up and crashed his volley home.\nTwo-two. Extra time. Into the 112th minute. Kenny thumped the ball forward again. Paul Peschisolido chested down, 25 yards from goal. Inside. Outside. Inside? Again? A scuff. Perhaps the most beautiful scuff you\u2019ll ever see. Ward going the wrong way. And then. Oh my god! Oh MY GOD! OH MY GOD!!!\nPeschisolido\u2019s celebration has gone down in Blades folklore but despite it taking place right in front of me in the John Street Stand I can\u2019t say I saw any of it. As the ball trundled over the line, the terraces exploded. The three of us (my dad was on the Kop; my uncle, it transpired later, had abandoned his seat at the end of our row and was sprinting gleefully along the concourse) formed a tiny part of a huge broiling, cavorting mass of joy.\nThere was still time for Walker to score an own goal and our Robert Page to set nerves fluttering with one of his own but the team that had fallen just short against Liverpool, that had been thwarted by David Seaman\u2019s wonder-save at Old Trafford, this time wouldn\u2019t be denied. It ended 4-3. It was the best I ever felt in a football ground. I\u2019m pretty certain it always will be.\nLet\u2019s not mention the final.",

He is currently in Pakistan with his family ahead of Ramadan, but he\u2019s leaning toward coming back to the US.\n\u201cThis was what we signed up for, right?\u201d Hussain said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fire out there, firefighters can\u2019t sort of count themselves out.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not alone in his sense of duty right now, but he is among the few who have been given a path to action. There\u2019s a much larger army of medical students in the US impatiently awaiting their marching orders even as some of their schools bench them during the greatest fight of their young lives.\n\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m being sidelined at a time when the world needs help medically the most, and it\u2019s frustrating for me,\u201d said Haley Shumway, who attends the Rocky Vista University college of osteopathic medicine.\nCoronavirus has completely upended medical students\u2019 lives as learning goes virtual, schools restrict direct patient care to varying degrees and graduation ceremonies lose their pomp and circumstance. A student population accustomed to planning years in advance is being told to sit tight even as their country is in dire need of the skill sets and specialties they have been developing for years.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in this limbo place, where I have training to help, but I\u2019m also being told to stay at home,\u201d said Kelly McDermott, who graduates from Eastern Virginia medical school this year.\nAdam Eddington, a student at Dartmouth\u2019s Geisel school of medicine, was working in pediatrics when he was pulled from patient care by his school. Even though Covid-19 hasn\u2019t affected children as much as other demographics, Eddington gets that it wouldn\u2019t be fair for him to progress normally in his training while so many of his peers can\u2019t. Still, he wrestled with his school\u2019s choice for a bit.\n\u201cI think all in all it was the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as I know, it\u2019s unprecedented, and it\u2019s gonna take a lot of work to make sure that we adapt and move forward to try to get all the experience and get all the qualifications that are necessary to make us really good physicians. But I have faith in the systems in place to try to do that.\u201d\nMany students learned that they would be temporarily removed from direct patient care a few weeks ago, around the same time that the Association of American Medical Colleges issued guidance on the subject.\nAlison Whelan, chief medical education officer for the AAMC, said her organization encouraged members to suspend clinical experiences because of personal protective equipment shortages, a lack of widely available, rapid testing and the need to limit contact between people as much as possible. She and her colleagues have since reiterated their guidance, unless there\u2019s a critical local need for healthcare workers.\n\u201cA lot of us understand that we aren\u2019t the most essential as medical students, \u2019cause we\u2019re learning. But at the same time, a lot of us wanted to be involved and wanted to learn how to handle situations like this in the future,\u201d said Sara Grant, a student at the Oakland University William Beaumont school of medicine.\nThe suggestion doesn\u2019t mean students have to stop learning, Whelan said, or even that their rotations have to end. In practice, it\u2019s been handled in different ways, depending on the school.\nAt Oakland, Grant said she and her classmates were participating in virtual lectures, working through interactive cases and physical exam videos, and doing other supplements to try to troubleshoot for what they were missing in-person. Similarly, Dartmouth moved almost entirely online, and Eddington said students like him suddenly had access to a series of non-clinical electives as well as swiftly organized Covid-19 ethics and microbiology courses.\nShumway wasn\u2019t given guidance from Rocky Vista for a week and a half, beyond studying for exams. But eventually, the school sent an email asking students to fill support roles in and outside the hospital \u2013 everything from comforting overflow patients to triaging over the phone.\nAt the University of California, San Francisco school of medicine, students were not categorically removed from patient care, except for known or suspected Covid-19 cases.\nJohn Davis, associate dean for curriculum at the school, called it an \u201ceducational imperative\u201d to give especially his most advanced learners the opportunity to watch people who are responding to the crisis in real time before they in turn assume some of those responsibilities.\n\u201cUltimately, I do think that the students who are graduating now will graduate with additional skills and competencies that other cohorts might not have had, which is being able to respond to a pandemic,\u201d Davis said.\nStudents who have had their clinical experiences put on pause aren\u2019t just twiddling their thumbs. Even before Shumway got more detailed direction from her school, she was scrounging up ways to use her medical knowledge outside of a patient care environment. After hearing a lot of dangerous rumors and pseudoscience circulating around the coronavirus pandemic, she decided to make a podcast that set the record straight.\nVitamin C and essential oils can\u2019t cure Covid-19, she explained. Saunas and hot baths won\u2019t prevent infection, either. And swishing vinegar doesn\u2019t do much of anything to fight the disease, despite a meme her friend posted on Facebook claiming otherwise.\n\u201cI\u2019m not comparing the common cold to this virus, but the common cold is also a virus. And has your mother ever asked you to go swallow some vinegar to get rid of your cold? No,\u201d she said.\nOther students are babysitting for physicians, donating blood, volunteering at food drives, rounding up personal protective equipment from local businesses, or even just providing accurate information to their networks as panic and fake news around the pandemic spreads.\n\u201cThose things are meaningful now, and they need to believe that,\u201d Whelan said.\nMeanwhile, some are already readying themselves for the next time their country calls.\n\u201cLife is really, really short, and it should be spent wearing yourself out, trying to help people,\u201d Eddington said. \u201cAnd if that means that I get worn out trying to help people in the next pandemic, then that would be fine.\u201d",

He still has a cough and a temperature, more than 11 days after first reporting symptoms.\nNo 10 insisted it had been \u201ctransparent throughout\u201d Johnson\u2019s illness, despite having described the prime minister\u2019s symptoms as mild right up until his hospital admission. Johnson himself only admitted to still having a temperature, not a cough, in his video message on Friday morning. No 10 has now changed its description of his symptoms to \u201cpersistent\u201d.\nTwo Tory ministers \u2013 Nadine Dorries and James Duddridge \u2013 have suggested Johnson needs to rest.\nHowever, No 10 said he was taking advice from his doctors on whether it was safe for him to continue working and was still in touch with No 10 officials from his hospital bed.\nEarlier, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted Johnson was fit enough to lead the country from his hospital bed after he was admitted with persistent coronavirus symptoms.\nJohnson was admitted on Sunday evening with a high fever on the advice of his doctor, with Downing Street saying he was undergoing routine tests. He was kept in overnight.\nMost coronavirus patients stay in hospital for more than a week. However, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.\u201d\nIf his condition worsens, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab chaired a Monday morning meeting of the government\u2019s C-19 committee, which is leading the response to the pandemic. However, Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting has been cancelled.\nThe pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action. The prime minister had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street.\nThe Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing.\nBut Downing Street flatly denied the prime minister\u2019s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital.\nAsked if it was time for colleagues in the cabinet and civil service to tell Johnson to rest, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cHe has worked phenomenally hard, as have many people across the country. This has been a uniquely intense period and I know for him personally it will be very frustrating that he has had to go to hospital to have these tests.\n\u201cHe will want to be back in No 10 leading from the front, which is his way. But he remains in charge of the government; he will be updated regularly in hospital, as he has been as he\u2019s self-isolating.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: \u201cHe\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve been talking to him every day, several times a day \u2026 he\u2019s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he\u2019s still got a temperature.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also contracted the virus but was recovering.\nWhile No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would have in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister\u2019s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus.\n\u201cDoctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,\u201d said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n\u201cThey will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.\u201d\nWith Johnson in hospital, the ministers involved in the government\u2019s coronavirus response will be looking ahead to next weekend, which is the point at which it will have to extend or end the lockdown.\nJenrick signalled the lockdown was unlikely to be lifted at the end of the week, saying some of the most challenging weeks were probably still to come. As communities secretary, he said the government \u201cdesperately\u201d did not want to shut parks but it could happen if people continued to congregate for picnics.\nCritics of the government are concerned that ministers have not identified a way out of the lockdown, with doubts about its ability to scale up testing for live cases and the efficacy of new antibody tests to find out whether people have had the virus.\nThe former prime minister Tony Blair called for a senior minister to \u201ctake charge of testing, and nothing else, with people with business experience of how you ramp up industrial scale production\u201d.\nHe said it was not the right choice for an epidemiologist to be in charge of this effort, after the government put Prof John Newton of Public Health England in charge.\n\u201cUnless you are able to get mass testing at scale, with speed, I don\u2019t see how you can get a way out of this lockdown and I am terrified by the economic damage we are doing with every week this lockdown continues,\u201d Blair told the Today programme.\n\u201cThis damage is enormous \u2026 If it goes on for a long time then it doesn\u2019t just affect the economy per se, it also affects the ability to operate your healthcare service effectively.\u201d\nHis comments echo the calls of the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has for more than a week advocated a return to mass community testing to suppress virus hotspots where they arise.",

The creditors are likely to be suppliers who have not been paid for stock they have provided.\nThe retailer\u2019s creditors will now be prevented from pursuing legal action for 10 working days while Debenhams tries to secure a new rescue deal.\nThe retailer has been battling the effects of \u00a3600m of debt, tough competition and the downturn on the high street. It has closed 22 stores this year and plans to close a total of 50 outlets across the UK.\nStefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive, said he was working with landlords and pension trustees and \u201cstriving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores as we can, as soon as this is possible.\u201d\nThe majority of the group\u2019s employees in the UK are being paid under the government\u2019s furlough scheme after its order for all non-essential stores to close. The retailer has also written to its landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday\nDebenhams is continuing to trade online across the UK, Ireland and Denmark, and customer orders, gift cards and returns are being accepted and processed normally.\nJulie Palmer, a partner at the insolvency firm Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cDebenhams has been in financial difficulties for a while so this doesn\u2019t come as a major surprise, but it will leave its 20,000-plus strong workforce in a precarious position during the ongoing uncertainty.\u201d\nDebenhams is one of many retailers in financial difficulties because of the coronavirus shutdown.\nSince the measures began, several other chains including New Look and the Topshop owner, Arcadia, have declined to pay their rent and furloughed their staff.\nTwo of Britain\u2019s largest shopping centre owners, Intu Properties and Hammerson, reported that they had received about only a third of rent due from their tenants for the second quarter of the year on its due date at the end of March.\nAn extended period of store closures has left an estimated \u00a310bn of clothing piling up in warehouses.",

United tweeted: \u201cEveryone at Manchester United is saddened to hear this terrible news. We send our heartfelt condolences to Pep and his family.\u201d\nLast month Guardiola donated \u20ac1m to the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation and Medical College of Barcelona for the purchase of equipment to help fight the virus in Spain.

Lord Falconer, the former solicitor general who was closely associated with Tony Blair\u2019s government, will return to the shadow cabinet as shadow attorney general.\nThe newly announced cabinet is majority female, with seven BAME MPs included. A quarter of appointees attended fee-paying schools, with just under a third Oxbridge graduates.\nMiliband, who was the energy secretary under Gordon Brown and led the party from 2010 until the 2015 general election, said in a statement that he looked forward to playing a part in the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis.\n\u201cAs Keir has said, we cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe will need to reshape our economy, addressing the insecurity many millions of workers face. We must also return to climate change as the unavoidable long-term issue of our time.\u201d\nThe appointments of Miliband and Falconer to the shadow cabinet signal the ascent of the soft left in the party, at the expense of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting hard left who have dominated since 2015.\nStarmer\u2019s victory on Sunday was emphatic, with him winning 56.2% of the members\u2019 and affiliates\u2019 votes, having already won a majority of votes among the Parliamentary Labour party.\nStarmer\u2019s allies have insisted there will be no \u201cpurge\u201d of the left but add that there will be a marked shift in tone. \u201cWe will be putting the country first, and we will be presenting ourselves as an alternative government. We are not seeking ideological purity,\u201d said one.\nRebecca Long-Bailey, who came second behind Starmer in the contest to become leader, has been given a job as shadow education secretary. She is one of few outright supporters of Corbyn who have survived a cull of the last cabinet.\nAndy McDonald, another Corbyn ally, has been made shadow employment rights and protections secretary. Among those from the left of the party who were ousted were Diane Abbott, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Barry Gardiner, Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. All will now return to the backbenches.\nAnother defeated leadership candidate, Emily Thornberry, will return as shadow international trade secretary.\nThe newly announced shadow cabinet is majority female, with 17 women and 15 men.

Tony Lloyd, the incumbent, has been hospitalised with the coronavirus, it emerged on Monday.\nOn Sunday, Starmer surprised many when he made Nandy, another candidate he defeated to become Labour leader, his shadow foreign secretary. Anneliese Dodds, who became an MP only in 2017, was promoted to become shadow chancellor.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, takes over from Abbott as shadow home secretary. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Miliband. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\nAs widely predicted, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, will remain in his job.\nConstituencies in the north-west and London are equally represented, with 19% of the shadow cabinet representing a seat in one of these two regions, while 12.5% of Starmer\u2019s cabinet represent Yorkshire and the Humber.\nAt 49, the average age of Starmer\u2019s cabinet is slightly older than Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet (48). More than half of the shadow cabinet were born in the 1970s and 80s.\nThree quarters of the new shadow cabinet attended a state school, with 20 MPs attending comprehensives and four attending a grammar. A further five went to a fee-paying school, including Dodds.\nNine members of the shadow cabinet studied at Oxford or Cambridge, just under a third of the total. All but three were university graduates.\nCommenting on the new team, Starmer said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have appointed a shadow cabinet that showcases the breadth, depth and talents of the Labour party.\n\u201cThis is a new team that will be relentlessly focused on acting in the national interest to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding Labour so that it can win the next election.\u201d\n Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition.\n Angela Rayner, deputy leader and chair of the Labour party.\n Anneliese Dodds, shadow chancellor of the exchequer.\n Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary.\n Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow home secretary.\n Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\n David Lammy, shadow justice secretary.\n John Healey, shadow defence secretary.\n Ed Miliband, shadow business, energy and industrial secretary.\n Emily Thornberry, shadow international trade secretary.\n Jonathan Reynolds, shadow work and pensions secretary.\n Jonathan Ashworth, shadow secretary of state for health and social care.\n Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary.\n Jo Stevens, shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary.\n Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\n Luke Pollard, shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary.\n Steve Reed, shadow communities and local government secretary.\n Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary.\n Jim McMahon, shadow transport secretary.\n Preet Kaur Gill, shadow international development secretary.\n Louise Haigh, shadow Northern Ireland secretary (interim while Tony Lloyd is in hospital being treated for coronavirus).\n Ian Murray, shadow Scotland secretary.\n Nia Griffith, shadow Wales secretary.\n Marsha de Cordova, shadow women and equalities secretary.\n Andy McDonald, shadow employment rights and protections secretary.\n Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow minister for mental health.\n Cat Smith, shadow minister for young people and voter engagement.\n Lord Falconer, shadow attorney general.\n Valerie Vaz, shadow leader of the house.\n Nick Brown, opposition chief whip.\n Lady Smith, shadow leader of the Lords.\n Lord McAvoy, Lords\u2019 Opposition chief whip.\nAdditional reporting by Caelainn Barr",

That same day, its CEO learned the hospital probably had its first coronavirus patient.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has put a strain even on the wealthier parts of America\u2019s vast, fragmented healthcare system: there are not enough beds, not enough ventilators, not enough protective equipment. But in rural communities, the stakes are different: not whether there will be enough beds at the local hospital, but whether the local hospital will be able to stay open at all.\nLike many American families, rural hospitals in the United States have been operating paycheck to paycheck for years, never making enough money to save up for an emergency. Now, the pandemic is threatening the survival of many rural hospitals, which would leave communities particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus with fewer hospital beds and fewer options.\nAt least three rural hospitals have announced abrupt closures in recent weeks, including one in Wellington, Kansas, and two in West Virginia, leaving local residents and healthcare providers scrambling to make new plans for the pandemic.\nThree Rivers hospital, in a remote area of Washington state near the border with Canada, has been at the frontlines of the crisis.\nThe hospital serves about 15,000 people scattered over 2,500 sq miles (about 6,400 sq km), according to its CEO, Scott Graham. Its surrounding  towns are tiny: one or two grocery stores, one gas station. \u201cWe think of it as more frontier than rural,\u201d Graham said.\nThree Rivers hospital had scraped by for years with a smaller-than-optimal staff and careful economizing, he said. Then, Washington became the first state with a confirmed case of coronavirus, and a confirmed coronavirus death.\nOnce social distancing guidelines were put in place, including guidelines to stop elective surgeries, \u201cour source of revenue basically stopped\u201d, Graham said. Patients who would typically visit the hospital for non-coronavirus-related health issues now seemed reluctant to come in. The volume of emergency room visits dropped. So did primary care. \u201cWhat little cash we had evaporated,\u201d Graham said.\nBy late March, Graham, who had been the hospital\u2019s CEO for six years, was starting to plan for something he had never done before: shutting down a hospital that no longer had enough money to function.\nOn 20 March, the state\u2019s hospital association wrote to the governor, Jay Inslee, warning that five rural hospitals, including Three Rivers, were \u201cfacing imminent closure\u201d.\nThe response from Washington state officials was swift, Graham said. Within hours of raising his concerns, he was on the phone with Sue Birch, a former nurse who had spent decades living in rural Colorado and now runs Washington state\u2019s healthcare authority.\nBirch said she promised Graham that they would find a way to get the hospital through the crisis.\n\u201cWe can talk about closures later,\u201d she recalled telling him. \u201cRight now, I need you holding my frontline.\u201d\nLosing a hospital is a serious blow to rural communities, whose residents are disproportionately older, and often struggle with existing health conditions. While Three Rivers does not have an intensive care unit (ICU), it\u2019s a place to go for immediate care, for health problems small and large, that\u2019s not an hour or more away.\nA hospital closure also has a huge economic toll, since in towns with \u201ca school and a Walmart and a church and a post office\u201d, as Birch put it, a small local hospital may be one of the major local employers. And it has ripple effects far beyond the rural areas the hospital directly serves.\n\u201cWe have to remind ourselves that we are all in this together,\u201d Birch said. Rural areas \u201care where our food is produced. We urban areas need them, and they need us.\u201d\nAmid the coronavirus pandemic, rural hospitals play a critical role.\nAs urban hospitals brace for a wave of seriously ill coronavirus patients, Three Rivers has been planning to use its beds to take in the overflow of other patients from those larger hospitals, helping the state hospital system as a whole stay afloat, Graham said.\nWhile Three Rivers could provide about one or two patients with ventilators, Graham said, it does not have a formal ICU, or staff trained to work with ICU patients. But it will help take in and stabilize more seriously ill coronavirus patients before sending them to a larger hospital, with more advanced equipment, about an hour away.\nIt can only do any of these things if its own doors stay open.\nThe first financial lifeline for Three Rivers came from Washington state, which sent an emergency $2m out to a small group of struggling rural hospitals in March. Three Rivers got about $200,000.\nBut keeping the hospital running costs roughly $1m a month, Graham said, with payroll for staff alone costing at least $700,000 a month. The emergency funds from the state, although helpful, only pushed the hospital\u2019s money crisis back about two weeks.\nAs he was trying to secure protective gear for hospital staff and prepare for a surge of coronavirus patients, Graham also made desperate calls to lawmakers and journalists, trying to secure enough cash to make it through the hospital\u2019s next payday.\nMeanwhile, Birch, the state healthcare administrator, tried to work with federal healthcare authorities to open up more emergency money for rural hospitals in her state, and in others.\nThe federal government\u2019s lifeline for struggling hospitals, announced on 27 March, would send Three Rivers and other financially vulnerable hospitals an advance of three months of their typical payments for Medicare, the federally funded health insurance program for senior citizens.\nThat advance funding would allow the hospital to pay its staff at least through the spring and summer, until about early August. By then, Graham hopes, the virus will be more under control, and more normal hospital care, and the income from patients getting that care, will resume.\nThree Rivers submitted the paperwork for the Medicare advance on Wednesday, Graham said. Federal authorities told hospitals that they anticipated they could send out the payments within seven days.\nThe next day payroll for the hospitals\u2019 roughly 100 employees is Friday. If the payment comes as quickly as promised, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\nStill, Graham worries about the consequences of even a brief bureaucratic delay.\nThat\u2019s a fear shared by rural health experts, said George Pink, the deputy director of North Carolina rural health research program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\u201cIf a hospital misses payroll once, that can be the death knell,\u201d Pink said. \u201cYou\u2019re telling the community and the vendors and the staff that you\u2019re on the ropes.\u201d\nAt least 128 rural hospitals have shut down in the past decade alone, according to data assembled by the rural health research program.\nThere may be more substantial federal help on the way for rural hospitals at the brink of closure. Congress\u2019s $2.2tn emergency relief bill includes $100bn for hospitals. But how that money will be distributed and, again, how fast it will go out, is still not clear on the ground.\n\u201cThe details have been really, really sparse,\u201d Graham said.\nBirch said she is optimistic that the safety net for rural hospitals will hold through the pandemic. Emergency payments from the federal government should come reliably within seven days, if hospitals apply for them, she said.\nAs of Friday night, Three Rivers still had not received the Covid-19 testing results for the first patient who had been showing symptoms that had initially seemed consistent with coronavirus. Test results, like emergency funding, were still coming very slowly, when they came at all.\nBut one thing was clear: the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the rural county was rising. On Wednesday, it had just been three, Graham said. On Friday, it was six.",

About 4,000 of 9,000 will be furloughed during April and May.\nLundgren added: \u201cOur current priority is to safeguard short-term liquidity \u2026 in the event of a prolonged grounding of the fleet.\u201d\nEasyJet has used the government\u2019s Covid-19 corporate financing facility, which allows UK businesses to apply for loans at pre-crisis commercial rates.\nThe aviation sector had called for special government measures to help it survive, but the Treasury has been unwilling to assist airlines until wealthy shareholders dig deep.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would consider companies on a case-by-case basis, \u201conly if all commercial avenues have been explored, including raising capital from existing investors\u201d.\nHowever, Haji-Ioannou, whose family received a near \u00a360m share of \u00a3171m paid in dividends last month, said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, I will not inject any fresh equity in easyJet whilst the Airbus liability is in place.\u201d\nEasyJet is likely to explore ways of resisting his calls for an emergency meeting, which it said would be \u201can unhelpful distraction\u201d.",

        "content": "Most new electricity globally was green and coronavirus bailouts must boost this further, says agency\nAlmost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 uses renewable energy, representing an all-time record. New data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) shows solar, wind and other green technologies now provide more than one-third of the world\u2019s power, marking another record.\nFossil fuel power plants are in decline in Europe and the US, with more decommissioned than built in 2019. But the number of coal and gas plants grew in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East, which owns half the world\u2019s oil reserves, just 26% of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 was renewable.\nThe world has invested about $3tn in renewables over the past decade, according to Irena, but annual investments must double by 2030 to tackle the climate emergency.\n\u201cWhile the trajectory is positive, more is required to put global energy on a path with sustainable development and climate mitigation,\u201d said Francesco La Camera, director general of Irena. \u201cAt this challenging time, we are reminded of the importance of building resilience into our economies.\u201d\nLa Camera said the huge spending planned by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic must support green initiatives rather than fossil fuels. \u201cIn responding to today\u2019s crisis, governments may be tempted to focus on short-term solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cYet distinctions between short-, medium- and long-term challenges may be deceptive. The pandemic shows that delayed action brings significant economic consequences.\u201d\nThe global oil market is in turmoil, hit by collapsing demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns and a savage price war between Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. La Camera said: \u201cRenewable energy is a cost-effective source of new power that insulates power markets and consumers from volatility.\u201d Solar and wind power are now the cheapest form of electricity in two-thirds of the world.\nThe Irena data shows the increase in new renewable energy capacity slowed slightly in 2019 - from 179GW to 176GW \u2013 but that new fossil fuel power also fell. The total green energy installed to date around the world grew by 7.6%, with the UK\u2019s total rising 6.1%. The UK is now 11th in the world for installed renewables.\nNew solar power provided 55% of the new capacity, most of which was installed in Asia, with China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam leading the way. Other major increases were seen in the US, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ukraine.\nWind power made up 34% of the total, with almost half in China and significant additions in the US. Global wind power capacity remains just ahead of solar, with 95% being onshore turbines.\nOther green technologies \u2013 hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and marine energy \u2013 all grew modestly year-on-year. While small compared with solar and wind power, geothermal energy \u2013 tapping the heat of deep rocks \u2013 is growing, with Turkey, Indonesia and Kenya leading the way.",

        "content": "The Open has emerged as the outlier in this year\u2019s major scene after cancelling its 149th staging at Royal St George\u2019s in Kent this July.\nNo sooner had the R&A confirmed that unprecedented step in peacetime than golf\u2019s other big three \u2013 the US PGA Championship, Masters and US Open \u2013 issued new dates for 2020 despite the coronavirus crisis. The Ryder Cup also remains in its designated position from 25 September at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin.\nRoyal St George\u2019s, in Sandwich, will still have an Open slot but in July 2021. Martin Slumbers, the R&A\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cI can assure everyone that we have explored every option for playing the Open this year but it is not going to be possible.\n\u201cThere are many different considerations that go into organising a major sporting event of this scale. We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with.\u201d\nThere are also commercial factors. Insiders have confirmed the R&A has a pandemic insurance policy that is almost identical to Wimbledon\u2019s \u2013 cancelled last week \u2013 meaning it will be reimbursed for losses. The R&A\u2019s funding of various grassroots projects will not be affected by a cancellation that ends the Open\u2019s unbroken run since it resumed in 1946 after the war.\nMid-September had been cited as the most likely plan B but was ruled out on various grounds, including the fact the school summer holiday will have ended. About 200,000 spectators were expected at Sandwich in July and the R&A will refund those who cannot, or choose not to, attend next year.\nSt Andrews will host the 150th Open, as was always intended, but in 2022 as opposed to 2021. The likelihood is that Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon, initially due to host the Opens of 2022 and 2023 respectively, will each slip back a year.\nMost notable in a lengthy scheduling bulletin from golf bodies in the United States was a new Masters proposal. Augusta National typically hosts the year\u2019s first major in early April. The Masters now has \u201cintended dates\u201d of the week commencing 9 November in what would mark an historic shift.\n\u201cWe want to emphasise that our future plans are incumbent upon favourable counsel and direction from health officials,\u201d said Fred Ridley, Augusta National\u2019s chairman. \u201cProvided that occurs and we can conduct the 2020 Masters, we intend to invite those professionals and amateurs who would have qualified for our original April date and welcome all existing ticket holders to enjoy the excitement of Masters week.\n\u201cWe remain very mindful of the extraordinary and unprecedented challenges presented by coronavirus around the world. As such, we continue to keep in close contact with local, state and national health authorities to help inform our decisions.\u201d\nThe US PGA Championship, to be held at Harding Park in San Francisco, is now due to tee off on 6 August. This appears optimistic given news from California over the weekend. After Donald Trump projected an \u201cAugust or September\u201d start for sport with spectators in the US, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, asserted: \u201cI\u2019m not anticipating that happening in this state. We have to be careful not to over-promise.\u201d\nThe United States Golf Association simultaneously postponed the US Open, initially scheduled for 18-21 June at Winged Foot in New York, and delivered a revised start date of 17 September. This means the major would be played the week before the US hosts Europe in the Ryder Cup. That biennial joust has thus far been unaffected.\nThe PGA Tour has announced plans to complete its regular season on Monday 7 September, with the conclusion of the Tour Championship at East Lake. \u201cThe Tour will seek to reschedule tournaments into the weeks formerly occupied by the US Open, the Open and the men\u2019s Olympic golf competition in June and July,\u201d it added.\nIt has been suggested the PGA Tour may look to return to competition in June but without spectators. The European Tour will schedule revisions in the coming weeks.",

Trump also said the federal government had stockpiled about 29m doses.\nThe same evening, reports emerged that Navarro got into a verbal fight with Fauci at a coronavirus taskforce meeting in the White House Situation Room on Saturday.\nSpeaking to CNN on Monday, Navarro acknowledged the disagreement and said he told Fauci in response to his concerns about the anecdotal nature of evidence regarding hydroxychloroquine: \u201cI would have two words for you: \u2018second opinion\u2019.\u201d\nNavarro told CNN that studies including one published in the last few days involving Wuhan, China prove hydroxychloroquine can help coronavirus patients recover. Navarro said the Wuhan study was one of the first randomized in a control group.\nThe trade adviser also claimed his PhD in economics qualified him to have such debates with health experts like Fauci.\n\u201cDoctors disagree about things all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD, and I understand how to read statistical studies.\u201d\nAt the White House briefing on Sunday, Trump was asked if he should be \u201cplaying doctor\u201d by pushing an unproven drug.\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, great,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work \u2026 it doesn\u2019t kill people.\u201d\nIn March, an Arizona man died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine.\n\u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the man\u2019s wife told NBC.\nThe federal government has approved clinical trials in New York and given doctors emergency dispensation to prescribe the drug for coronavirus patients.\nNavarro told CNN that at Saturday\u2019s meeting \u201cthere was unanimous agreement that [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] would immediately begin surging hydroxy into the hot zones to be dispensed only between a doctor and a patient decision not the federal government\u201d.\nAt the White House on Saturday, Trump said he might take hydroxychloroquine himself \u2013 though he would have to ask his doctors.",

The US comic, a regular on shows including Conan, steps into character as bland-but-confident observational comic Jerry O\u2019Hearn. And somehow he is able to create five incredibly funny minutes without once actually saying anything specific.\nI first saw the routine about eight years ago. There\u2019s a YouTube clip of a bootleg recording tagged: \u201cJerry O\u2019Hearn (Andy Daly) at MaxFunCon 2011.\u201d Daly is quick to establish O\u2019Hearn\u2019s outlook: \u201cAll this stuff that\u2019s going on in the world today? You gotta be kidding me!\u201d What follows is ambiguous, meaningless standup that is nevertheless delivered with the self-righteous bafflement of a man convinced he is setting the world to rights. It\u2019s a detail-free jaunt through every classic standup subject, running on gusto alone.\nThe routine is not just very entertaining, though. From a nerdier technical perspective, it\u2019s amazing to see that standup, stripped entirely of any actual content, can still be recognisable as standup. Watching that clip, with its glaring light and distant sound, one gets the pleasure of a niche discovery \u2013 of something unique, daring, clever, silly and gloriously vague.\nBudPod, Phil Wang\u2019s podcast with Pierre Novellie, is available on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify.\nRose Matafeo: Paul F Tompkins\u2019 Peanut Brittle\nWhen I was in my teens, big acts rarely travelled to New Zealand, so I enjoyed most of my standup through comedy albums I borrowed from the library or CDs bought from the shop. My favourite was the 2007 album Impersonal by the US comic Paul F Tompkins.\nMy most listened-to track was Peanut Brittle. The entire routine is about those novelty cans labelled peanut brittle that actually contain spring-loaded snakes. The skit is completely perfect, flowing seamlessly between observations about the stupidity of the product and impressions of execs trying out new fonts for the can to keep the product relevant. It culminates in a lengthy section where Tompkins becomes a naive recipient of the can, oblivious to the prank within.\nI attribute most of my comedy taste and style to this routine. I learned so much about rhythm from Tompkins. Great standup requires an equal balance of strong performance and strong writing: when you see the perfect alchemy of those, it feels like actual magic. I love Tompkins for all the reasons I love comedy: he makes the obscure or niche into something relatable, with stupid voices, SHOUTING, and a celebration of shared human experience. That\u2019s comedy, baby!\nRose Matafeo\u2019s podcast Boners of the Heart is on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify.

It all felt blokey and loud. But then, backstage at a gig, I saw a comic who looked really nervous and thought: \u201cOh, there\u2019s someone a bit like me.\u201d Her name was Maria Bamford and she made me realise there were other comics out there doing material about their personal insecurities. When she talked about how she perceived the world, I found it so inspiring.\nI saw her Burning Bridges tour at Edinburgh that year. There was one routine, Celebrity Homes, that I particularly loved. It was based on those US TV shows about famous people\u2019s houses that are always presented as: \u201cI\u2019ve got a huge house, you\u2019d love to see it!\u201d\nShe did a perfect impression of those shows, then another as if they\u2019d come to her own home, an apartment. \u201cLet\u2019s go sit on the futon, look through the bars on the window, and watch the helicopters circle!\u201d It really summed up the contrast of her very real world compared to the shiny TV world often portrayed on screen.\nIt took me a long time to learn that you need to be confident in your own insecurities for people to want to listen to them \u2013 and Bamford helped with that. Her comedy is alternative standup at its finest \u2013 storytelling from the outside looking in.\nTom Allen is releasing Isolation Tips videos on Instagram (@tomindeed). He\u2019s part of Radio 2\u2019s Funny Fortnight on BBC Sounds.\nJohn Kearns: Eddie Izzard\u2019s Swiss Army Knife\nI first heard the Swiss Army Knife routine on the radio in my dad\u2019s car. I was being dropped off at the cinema but remember thinking the film could wait, as Eddie Izzard went through each instrument of war on his knife one by one: \u201cI can see you with my magnifying glass!\u201d I was giddy with how silly it all was.\nHis Swiss accent instantly makes you want to do one yourself: \u201cMy little saw!\u201d I would re-enact the routine with my own penknife. How that looked out on Tooting Bec Common, I don\u2019t know. The routine is only about a minute long yet its impact was great. When you stumble across a comedian, and are still too young to realise how famous they are, a skit can feel like it\u2019s been tailor-made for you. It\u2019s your secret and you\u2019re torn between sharing it or keeping it to yourself.\nSwiss Army Knife is part of Glorious, a film of a gig Izzard did in 1997 that is striking for its ambition and scope. Beginning with the Old Testament and ending with Armageddon, he roots everything in the tiniest of details. On the first day God created \u201cbaked potatoes and crinkly things \u2026 very small avenues \u2026 toilets in French camping sites\u201d.\nWhat\u2019s so inspiring about the Swiss Army Knife routine, and the entire Glorious album really, is the amount of work that must have gone into it. Not a word is wasted, nothing is left to chance. In this great showcase of life\u2019s tiny absurdities, there must have been hours and hours of failure before he perfected the sound of a tiny saw going back and forth. It\u2019s a reminder to me that there are no short cuts in comedy. Only hard work can make a performance look so effortless.\nMicroscope, John Kearns\u2019s podcast with Mat Ewins, is on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify. He is on tour later this year \u2013 for rescheduled dates, see Twitter @johnsfurcoat\nLou Sanders: Michelle Wolf\u2019s Women are Their Own Worst Enemies\nLast Christmas I sat down to watch Michelle Wolf\u2019s latest Netflix special, Joke Show. About 30 minutes in, the US comedian talked about how women will never be equal with men because we judge each other so harshly instead of sticking together. That\u2019s something I think about a lot.\nWolf is surprisingly critical of women giving men a hard time. For example, if a guy is manspreading, she says, he\u2019s not doing it maliciously \u2013 he\u2019s just not thinking. It reminded me of when I was on a long-haul flight. I was in the middle seat with a woman one side and a man the other. The man was really dominating my space: two armrests, heavy breathing, that kind of thing. I didn\u2019t ask him to move because I\u2019m an idiot. I just moaned to the woman that he was in my space and rolled my eyes. When we landed, I found out they were a married couple! They\u2019d made me sit between them, the mad twots.\nI\u2019m making it sound dry, but the routine\u2019s actually funny and wise \u2013 with lots of silly jokes about women scissoring. Since everyone is represented equally heinously, guys can\u2019t be offended. She\u2019s tearing us all a new one. The routine\u2019s a manifesto, except Wolf also jokes about how the kind of people who write manifestos are wackos. So it\u2019s not really a manifesto. It\u2019s just good standup.\nCuddle Club, Lou Sanders\u2019 podcast, is available on Apple Podcasts, Acast and Spotify. She\u2019s on tour later this year with Say Hello to Your New Step-Mummy. Dates at lousanders.com.\nKae Kurd: Eddie Murphy\u2019s Italians After They See Rocky\nI first watched Raw, the film of Eddie Murphy doing standup in the 1980s, when I was about 16. I found it on YouTube, which is how I discovered most comedy when I was a teenager. There are few people that can do voices and act-outs so well. He does an Italian guy coming out of a cinema and telling another guy about watching Rocky.\n\u201cYou know what I like about Sly\u2019s movies?\u201d he says. \u201cThe realism.\u201d I used to crack up every time I heard that. This dude, who\u2019s obviously not a film critic, is trying to intellectualise the film to suit his own narrative. At times, it doesn\u2019t even feel like it\u2019s Eddie any more: you feel like this character has become real. He has such flair: it all seems so effortless as he makes every character feel authentic and unique. Even if they have a similar accent, they have different voices and distinctive mannerisms.\nWhen I was in school, I would do a lot of voices and impressions. I\u2019d spend hours watching Eddie to see how he created a character. There was always a purpose to the voices and impressions: they formed a story or were part of a situation. There is no point doing impressions just to show people you can do them. What\u2019s their purpose?\nIt made me understand that people love things they can relate to. I\u2019ve tried to stay true to that. I love that routine because he\u2019s not trying to preach to you like a lot of modern comics do. It\u2019s just Eddie Murphy being effortlessly funny.\nKae Kurd is touring the UK with Spoken Kurd from October. Tickets: www.kaekurd.com.",

        "content": "With memorable roles in Goldfinger and The Avengers, Blackman became an icon of British cinema through her formidable, no-nonsense persona\n\u2018My name is Pussy Galore.\u201d \u201cI must be dreaming.\u201d The cool appraising glance of Honor Blackman falls on Sean Connery\u2019s preposterous, smirking Bond as he awakens aboard Auric Goldfinger\u2019s private jet, and she becomes that rarest of things: a Bond girl who is allowed to introduce herself by name, and perhaps unique as one who is as old or older than Bond.\nAnd though the camera in that movie lingers on her corona of honey-blonde hair, blue eyes, sculpted cheekbones and droll half-smile, she is not as obviously sexualised as Shirley Eaton\u2019s bikini-clad Jill Masterson. Blackman is a mature love interest, Goldfinger\u2019s personal pilot in charge of a squadron of female aviators called Pussy Galore\u2019s Flying Circus (an influence, surely, on Britain\u2019s great comedy creation) and one who was capable of executing a skilled judo throw on 007 before their roll in the hay. Galore coldly rejects Bond\u2019s knowing banter about how personal a \u201cpersonal pilot\u201d she is. \u201cI\u2019m a damn good pilot,\u201d she snaps. Blackman\u2019s Miss Galore was someone with a distinct no-nonsense Home Counties manner, the Bond version of Miss Joan Hunter Dunn. Perhaps it was this formidable persona which allowed the movie to get away with that absurdly pornified name, so outrageous that 1964 was probably the last time anyone could get away with it.\nTo say that Honor Blackman was the greatest Bond girl is not a distinction that any female star would want to have, although Blackman was always effusive about Connery, calling him the sexiest actor she had every worked with. She was also very amusing about Gert Frobe, the German actor playing Goldfinger, and having to respond calmly when Frobe gabbled his heavily accented lines (which later had to be dubbed).\nAt the time, she was probably equally or more famous for playing the athletic Cathy Gale in The Avengers on TV, opposite the dapper, bowler-hatted Patrick Macnee, with whom she also recorded the cheeky and somewhat bizarre pop single Kinky Boots. Again, this was well before Goldfinger was released. Blackman had something more like equal billing in The Avengers, in which her bantering rapport with her male co-star was important. It was the persona of Cathy Gale that probably meant Pussy Galore was a bit more of an interesting and forthright character.\nGoldfinger and Bond launched Blackman into what became a long career, and she spoke with good humour about being the eternal sex-fantasy of a million male Bond fans of a certain age; her cut-glass manner meant that this fanbase was very British. She had been the imperious and blonde goddess Hera in Jason and the Argonauts the year before, and a goddess was probably what she was born to play. She worked with Connery four years later in Edward Dmytryk\u2019s Shalako, a western in which Connery is the tough US cavalry officer and Blackman is the simmeringly sexy-posh Lady Julia Dagger in a hunting party of European adventurers, who is having an affair with Stephen Boyd\u2019s macho frontiersman. She appeared in a clutch of films around this time, opposite names such as Laurence Harvey and Dean Martin, and kept her movie career ticking over in the years that followed, largely in that kind of well-off role, verging on stereotype, which she sportingly sent up in a comically self-aware cameo in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary in 2001.\nBlackman may have found more reward on the stage, where her theatrical training served her well, and on television, where she had steady work, including iconic appearances in Coronation Street, Casualty and Doctor Who. Blackman always gave every impression of never taking it too seriously, and certainly not her part in the continuing 007 franchise. Elegance, wit, martial arts and familiarity with gadgets and hardware were supposed to be Bond\u2019s exclusive department. But Honor Blackman became a Brit movie icon by doing all that as well.",

        "content": "Many actors might have objected to being associated throughout their careers with a character called Pussy Galore. But Honor Blackman, who has died aged 94, revelled in the notoriety of the role of the aviator she played in the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964).\nHaving been knocked out with a tranquilliser gun by a hench- man, the first thing Bond (Sean Connery) sees when he regains consciousness is Blackman\u2019s face leaning over him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d, he asks. \u201cMy name is Pussy Galore,\u201d she says. \u201cI must be dreaming,\u201d he replies. Later, after trying a few judo moves on each other, they fall into a different kind of clinch.\nBlackman thus became, and remained, according to most polls, the top Bond girl, helped to a certain extent by the double entendre name. The producers thought about changing the character\u2019s name but decided against it. However, the US censors refused to allow Pussy Galore to appear on promotional materials and she was consequently billed as Miss Galore. During promotion in the US, Blackman, who had already found fame in Britain as the agile, black leather-clad Cathy Gale in the television series The Avengers, took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character\u2019s name.\nBorn in Plaistow, east London, Blackman always called herself a cockney. Her father, Frederick, a civil service statistician, who believed he was passed over for promotion because of his accent, was determined that his four children should have better opportunities.\nFor Honor\u2019s 15th birthday, he offered her the choice between a bicycle and elocution lessons, and she chose the latter. \u201cMy teacher was wonderful,\u201d Blackman recalled. \u201cShe introduced me to poetry and plays and convinced my father that I had some talent. So, after attending North Ealing primary school and Ealing County grammar school for girls, I went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, though only one evening a week.\u201d\nAt the age of 22, Blackman started to get ingenue parts, palely loitering in mostly J Arthur Rank films. Among her better early roles was that of a middle-class girl hoping that her fiance (Dirk Bogarde) will get his idea of becoming a concert pianist out of his system in the The Alien Corn episode of the anthology film Quartet (1948); and Susie Bates, one of the three title roles in the rather dated A Boy, a Girl and a Bike (1949).\nIn A Night to Remember (1958), Blackman was one of the first-class passengers on the Titanic, determined not to leave the ship without her husband, and she was Norman Wisdom\u2019s love interest as a secret agent in the second world war farce The Square Peg (1958). Her final pre-Goldfinger film was as the Greek goddess Hera in Jason and the Argonauts (1963), bickering with her husband Zeus on Mount Olympus.\nIn 1962, as Cathy Gale, who could get the better of any villain in a fight, Blackman joined Patrick Macnee in the second season of the TV series The Avengers, setting the pattern for intelligent, stylish and assertive women who followed her in the show and elsewhere on films and television. The song that she recorded with Macnee, Kinky Boots, did not make a great impression when released in 1964, but fared better as a piece of 1960s nostalgia when reissued in 1990.\nBecause of The Avengers, Blackman was cast as Pussy Galore. She later stated that when she was playing the role of Pussy, she knew her character had been written as a lesbian in the novel, unlike in the film where, despite claiming to be immune to his charms, she is eventually bedded by Bond.\nHer early demure days at Rank long behind her, Blackman settled into a number of secondary \u201cother woman\u201d roles. In Life at the Top (1965), Blackman was seductive and sly as a TV commentator who lures Joe Lampton (Laurence Harvey) away from his wife, and as the unfulfilled wife of a pompous aristocrat (Jack Hawkins), she has a tumble in the hay with Bosky Fulton (Stephen Boyd) in the mediocre British western Shalako (1968), though the leads were Connery and Brigitte Bardot.\nAfter a topless scene in the unremarkable Canadian-set drama The Age of Innocence (1977) and appearing in the creaky gothic horror film The Cat and the Canary (1978), Blackman was not seen on the big screen for another two decades.\nMeanwhile, she was appearing regularly on television \u2013 principally as a glamorous, young-at-heart, man-eating mother in all 96 episodes of the sitcom The Upper Hand (1990-96) \u2013 and consistently on stage.\nBlackman\u2019s West End appearances included Wait Until Dark (1966) and The Deep Blue Sea (1977) and transfers of Broadway musicals, as the baroness in The Sound of Music (1981), Peggy in On Your Toes (1984), Mrs Higgins in My Fair Lady (2006) and Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider in Cabaret (2007). She spent most of 1987 as Mother Superior in the musical Nunsense at the Fortune theatre.\nHer return to feature films in the late 90s included a portrayal of Joy Adamson in To Walk With Lions (1999) and roles in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary (2001) and Cockneys vs Zombies (2012), a horror-comedy in which Blackman, returning to her roots, is a gun-toting senior citizen. In her late 80s, she toured with her one-woman show Honor Blackman as Herself, in which she sang songs , recited and told personal anecdotes.\nBlackman, a keen Liberal Democrat, was never afraid to express her political views. In 2002, she refused a CBE because she was a supporter of Republic, the campaign to replace the monarchy.\n\u201cThey ring you beforehand to ask if you\u2019d like to accept, and I think they were quite shocked when I declined,\u201d she commented. \u201cBut since I\u2019m a republican I thought it would be somewhat hypocritical to pop up to the palace.\u201d She always had sharp things to say about Margaret Thatcher\u2019s period as prime minister and even took Connery to task for his status as a tax exile.\nBlackman was twice married and divorced. She is survived by two children, Lottie and Barnaby, from her second marriage, to the actor Maurice Kaufmann.\n Honor Blackman, actor, born 22 August 1925; died 5 April 2020",

France is the latest country to do a U-turn, joining others such as the US, Austria and Singapore in advising the public to wear them. Covid-19 is spread from aerosols (tiny viral particles); we breathe in aerosols in crowded places like trains, buses and the tube, and we touch our face inadvertently numerous times with potentially infected hands. Masks will protect against this and will be even more crucial when we ease the lockdown to prevent a resurgence of cases.\nThe argument against mask use is incoherent. We can teach the public how to use masks properly, and ask people to use cloth masks until more medical masks are available to ensure the NHS has enough supplies.\nThe government has a duty to protect lives by a comprehensive strategy of social distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and protecting the vulnerable.Dr Beng GohEmeritus consultant physician, Royal London Hospital\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "There\u2019s a kind of hush all over the world as the reduction in human activity stops the Earth buzzing so much\nThe dramatic quietening of towns and cities in lockdown Britain has changed the way the Earth moves beneath our feet, scientists say.\nSeismologists at the British Geological Survey have found that their sensors are twitching less now that human activity has been curtailed, leading to a drop in the anthropogenic din that vibrates through the planet.\nThe fall in the human hum that rings around the world means that, in theory at least, the scientists should be able to detect smaller earthquakes in the UK, and more distant tremors in Europe and in countries further afield than their equipment usually allows.\n\u201cSeismometers measure ground vibrations and the vibrations we want to record are from earthquakes. But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,\u201d said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. \u201cAll these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.\u201d\nHuman-induced vibrations, known in the trade as \u201ccultural noise\u201d, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.\nThe UK\u2019s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. \u201cWe had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,\u201d said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.\nThe BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.\n\u201cIn theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,\u201d said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth\u2019s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.\nResearchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. \u201cWe aren\u2019t in a particularly active region,\u201d said Baptie. \u201cSo we may not get anything in the short term.\u201d",

The advice to anyone with those symptoms in England is to self-isolate at home.

In the most serious cases, the immune system fighting the virus overreacts. If that happens, what is known as a cytokine storm attacks their organs. The individual will need ventilation in hospital to take over their breathing and possibly mechanical support for their heart, liver or kidneys.\nPeople with symptoms at home will not get medical help unless they ask for it, unlike in some other countries, which have testing for people with symptoms and monitoring for them while at home.\nHealth authorities in the southern German city of Heidelberg have introduced a \u201ccorona taxi\u201d service, which allows medical personnel to visit patients with the virus at home and assess their progress. This was introduced after virologists and other doctors recognised that it often comes in two waves and that typically on the eighth day, patients\u2019 health can take a turn for the worse.\nPatients with confirmed infections or suspected to have coronavirus are being called on a regular basis by student doctors manning phone lines, and based on their accounts, a taxi crew can then arrange to visit them.\nFour of the taxis \u2013 small buses usually used for school runs \u2013 are constantly travelling around the city visiting patients.\n\u201cThese daily phone calls and house visits would totally overwhelm the doctors here,\u201d said Uta Merle, a medical director for gastroenterology and infections at Heidelberg University hospital, which is why medical students are being drafted in. Eight hundred have so far volunteered.\nHans-Georg Kr\u00e4usslich, the head of virology at the hospital, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung the visits are necessary because \u201coften patients don\u2019t have the courage to ring up the clinic and don\u2019t actually take their worsening state seriously\u201d.\nThanks to the taxis, he said, \u201cour colleagues have discovered quite a few patients who they were able to protect from a drastic worsening of their conditions\u201d.\nMany have been brought into hospital and put on ventilators as a result. That crucial move made just in time is believed to have saved many lives in Germany. The taxi crews have received letters of thanks from patients, crediting them with saving their lives.\nPankhania said people in the UK are no longer going to hospital for conditions other than Covid-19 in the sort of numbers that would be expected. \u201cFor whatever reason, we have frightened off the patient. Those things we should be seeing are not turning up. These people are soldiering on,\u201d he said.\nHe has himself heard of cases where people were very sick with symptoms resembling those of Covid-19, but did not seek medical help and died at home.\nHe said it was possible that some people were put off from calling NHS 111 when their symptoms worsened or if they still had a fever after a week \u2013 which are the first clues that their condition may be becoming severe.\nHe also does not think it is satisfactory for people with symptoms not to be tested. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be a GP. I would want to know who my patients with Covid-19 were. I would call them and ask them how they were. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t happen. The GP may or may not be aware of the patient.\u201d\nThe Office for National Statistics has recently begun to include deaths from Covid-19 in the community, including care homes. They show the total was more than 20% higher than the figure for hospital deaths alone.\n This article was amended on 7 April 2020 to make it clear in the headline, subheading and text that the concerns raised apply to the official advice in England only.",

        "content": "Liverpool have reversed their controversial decision to put around 200 non-playing staff on furlough after receiving fierce criticism for seeking government assistance during the coronavirus crisis.\nThe world\u2019s seventh-richest football club sparked outrage on Saturday when announcing they would follow Newcastle, Tottenham, Norwich and Bournemouth in using the coronavirus job retention scheme to cover 80% of wages due to staff whose work has stopped since the football calendar was suspended on 13 March. Liverpool had confirmed they would pay the remaining 20% to those on furlough, with almost 90 of those affected working in the club stores, and would consider reimbursing monies received at a later date.\nBut the move, coming six weeks after Liverpool announced a pre-tax profit of \u00a342m and increased turnover of \u00a3533m for 2018-19, attracted a barrage of criticism from former players and supporters. The Spirit of Shankly supporters\u2019 union demanded an explanation from the chief executive, Peter Moore, amid concern \u201cabout the damage this is causing to our club\u2019s reputation and values\u201d. The local MPs Dan Carden and Ian Byrne plus other politicians, including the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, and the metro mayor for the region, Steve Rotheram, also held talks with club officials before the U-turn from the owner, Fenway Sports Group.\nMoore announced the reverse in an open letter to Liverpool supporters that included a public apology for the tawdry episode. He wrote: \u201cA range of possible scenarios were considered, including but not restricted to: applying to the coronavirus job retention scheme which pays 80% of salary and guaranteeing the 20% payment; applying to the coronavirus job retention scheme with a guarantee to reimburse monies received at a later date and, thirdly, finding an alternative means to cover our furlough costs.\n\u201cIt is as a direct result of this extensive consultation and our own internal deliberations at various levels throughout the club that we have opted to find alternative means despite our eligibility to apply for the coronavirus job retention scheme. We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week to announce that we intended to apply to the coronavirus retention scheme and furlough staff due to the suspension of the Premier League football calendar, and are truly sorry for that.\u201d\nLiverpool stood to save up to \u00a31.5m by putting staff on furlough. Last year they paid \u00a343.8m in agents\u2019 fees and had a \u00a3310m wage bill. There has been disapproval at government level of wealthy Premier League clubs seeking taxpayers\u2019 money to help them through the crisis but despite the U-turn, which echoes FSG\u2019s reverse and apology over a proposed ticket-price hike in 2016, Moore has warned of a profound impact on the club\u2019s finances.\nHe added: \u201cOur intentions were, and still are, to ensure the entire workforce is given as much protection as possible from redundancy and/or loss of earnings during this unprecedented period. We are therefore committed to finding alternative ways to operate while there are no football matches being played that ensures we are not applying for the government relief scheme.\n\u201cWe would like to acknowledge the great army of staff and casual workers who work tirelessly to ensure Liverpool is a club that operates to the highest of standards. But in the spirit of transparency we must also be clear, despite the fact we were in a healthy position prior to this crisis, our revenues have been shut off yet our outgoings remain. And like almost every sector of society, there is great uncertainty and concern over our present and future.\n\u201cThe club continues to prepare for a range of different scenarios, around when football can return to operating as it did before the pandemic. It is an unavoidable truth that several of these scenarios involve a massive downturn in revenue, with correspondingly unprecedented operating losses. Having these vital financial resources so profoundly impacted would obviously negatively affect our ability to operate as we previously have. We are engaged in the process of exploring all avenues within our scope to limit the inevitable damage.\u201d\nThe manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, and a senior player committee of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum have told FSG they are willing to make pay sacrifices to ensure no one at the club loses their job.\nThe Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust urged their club to follow Liverpool\u2019s lead.\n It tweeted: \u201cWe are now saying it clearly and in public \u2013 do not further damage the Club\u2019s reputation, listen to your fans.\u201d",

She said she wanted to thank the people who are working to keep us safe and well, and that is so nice of her.\u201d\nA four-year-old boy whose birthday celebrations were cancelled because of the coronavirus lockdown was treated to a visit from a local police officer who stopped by to lift his spirits on the big day.\nDexter Lee should have been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his family but the trip had to be cancelled when the lockdown came into force.\nUnable to see any of his friends or family on the special day, Dexter\u2019s mum, Anna, asked if anyone knew of a police officer who could cheer up her son, who wants to join the force when he is older, with a special wave as they drove past.\nTo her surprise, Sgt Mark Wilson from Merseyside police, along with the force mascot, Bobby, turned up with a goody bag and a superhero card from Ch Con Andy Cooke especially for Dexter.\nDexter and his big brother, Freddie, even got to sit in the police van, while their grandparents watched from their cars, which were parked nearby.\n\u201cThe most we were hoping for was for a police officer to drive by and flash the sirens.

        "content": "Dow, German Dax and FTSE all rise amid signs that severity of the crisis may be easing\nInvestors were cheered on Monday by signs that the severity of the coronavirus crisis may be easing, helping the FTSE 100 to shrug off dire UK economic data.\nThe index of blue-chip shares climbed more than 3% to 5,582, raising hopes of a more sustained recovery after five consecutive weekly falls, with positive sentiment in the UK mirrored on Wall Street and other European indices such as Germany\u2019s Dax.\nThe market gains followed reports that some European governments were weighing up whether to lift the most stringent lockdown restrictions.\nAnalysts at the online trading firm IG said this had led to a buying spree, despite the likelihood that the second quarter of the year would be characterised by plunging economic indicators.\n\u201cThis might seem odd when we can expect weeks of poor data, but the simple fact is that talk of reopening economies is now widespread, and the data from Italy, Spain, Belgium and even New York is providing hope that some countries have passed the peak and others are nearing it,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, IG\u2019s chief market analyst.\nWhile the FTSE gained 3%, the Dow Jones was up more than 1,000 points or nearly 6% by lunchtime on Wall Street. Germany\u2019s Dax closed up nearly 6%.\nHowever, New York-based foreign exchange company OANDA warned that optimism among stock investors could fizzle out, once attention returns to the likelihood of lasting consumer caution.\n\u201cThe rally in equities will likely be short-lived as investors will soon have to become sceptical of the great recovery and focus on the financial stress that will happen after several key parts of the economy will not come back to life for many months,\u201d said senior market analyst Edward Moya.\n\u201cTravel, entertainment, and physical retail (excluding food and drug) will not see any normalcy until much later in the year. I don\u2019t see people going to a Broadway show, baseball game or trying to book a vacation this summer.\u201d\nIn the UK, the FTSE\u2019s gain was all the more remarkable given dismal figures from the construction and automotive sectors, which have been ravaged by shutdowns caused by Covid-19.\nConstruction suffered the sharpest fall in activity since the financial crisis during March, a survey showed on Monday, despite the industry being slower than other industries to shut down operations due to the coronavirus.\nThe figures from financial data provider IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) also confirmed data last week that showed the British private sector as a whole is contracting at its fastest rate in more than 20 years.\nThe construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index tumbled to 39.3 in March from 52.6 in February, with anything below 50 representing a decline in activity. The drop took the index to its lowest level since April 2009 and well below economists\u2019 average forecast of 44.0.\nThe 13-point monthly fall was the largest since the survey began in 1997, and the index could worsen still.\n\u201cThe sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further,\u201d Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said.\nSome construction projects have continued, with workers spaced two metres apart, allowing construction to escape the complete shutdowns seen elsewhere, such as in the hospitality industry.\nGareth Belsham, director of property consultancy Naismiths, said the continuation of some activity, coupled with the sector\u2019s experience of recovering from economic turmoil, should give cause for optimism.\n\u201cFew sectors have more bitter, regular experience of enduring sharp falls in confidence than construction.\n\u201cBattle scars in of themselves will provide no protection from a simultaneous drop in both demand and supply. But the fact that the declines seen during the 2008 financial crisis were worse offers some comfort. Construction weathered that storm successfully, and will do so again.\u201d\nThe automotive sector has been particularly hard hit over the past three weeks. Every major car manufacturer in the UK has shut down its factories and the industry trade body revealed on Monday that demand for new vehicles has also plunged, spelling more trouble ahead for the sector.\nSales of new cars in March fell 44% compared with the same month last year to 254,684 units, while first-quarter sales were down by 31% to 483,557, the SMMT said.\nThe trade body also slashed its sales forecast for this year by 23% to 1.73m vehicles because of the impact of the coronavirus crisis.",

The death of a West Dumbartonshire care worker that emerged on Sunday was also confirmed by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.\nThe fatalities came amid rising concern that those working in social care still do not have the protection they need amid the Covid-19 pandemic and that, without testing for the virus, staff risk contaminating care homes where elderly people are supposed to be \u201cshielded\u201d.\nPeter Kyle, the MP for Hove \u2013 which has about 30 care homes - said facilities were effectively being \u201cconverted into hospices\u201d because of a lack of protections. He said one home in his constituency had recorded 14 cases of coronavirus in residents aged over 75.\nIn Scotland, at least 15 residents at the 90-capacity Burlington Court care home in Glasgow have died after displaying symptoms of the virus.\nThey all had underlying health conditions and several were on \u201cend of life pathways\u201d, according to the care provider, Four Seasons. It declined to provide an update on further deaths, amid unconfirmed reports that several more residents were infected.\nNadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents small and medium-sized care providers, said: \u201cThe issue we hear most is: \u2018I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.\u2019\n\u201cOnce you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners. Government has not reacted quickly enough to build confidence in the sector that PPE [personal protective equipment] is available.\u201d\nKent county council is so short of protection items that it has asked partner organisations and thousands of its staff to try to drum up supplies. It said on Monday it has made \u201cstrong representations\u201d to the government about shortages and has been promised deliveries, but believes these will not meet its needs.\nOn 25 March, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was asked in parliament when all care home workers would get the protective equipment they needed and replied: \u201cBy the end of the week.\u201d\nMany in the care sector say this has not happened.\nLiz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, said about one in three care homes in her constituency still had no PPE on Friday.\n\u201cWhile [chancellor] Rishi Sunak was right to say the NHS would get whatever resources it needs, the same has got to be true for social care because the two services are inextricably linked,\u201d she said.\nCare workers can use large quantities of PPE if they follow government guidance that \u2013 in care homes with suspected or confirmed Covid cases or on domestic visits to a shielded person \u2013 they should wear gloves, plastic apron, mask and possibly eye and face protection.\nSome care managers are going into debt to keep staff and residents safe. Anita Astle, the manager of the Wren Hall nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where nine residents are in isolation with suspected Covid-19, paid \u00a39,000 for a consignment of masks at \u00a32.74 each \u2013 five times the usual price \u2013 because government supplies were insufficient.\n\u201cThe first delivery [from the government supply] was 160 masks,\u201d she said. \u201cI told them we were using 312 a day. I waited four days and got 400. The supply chain is completely useless.\u201d\nSam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, said: \u201cPeople who work in the care sector are extraordinary individuals, each and every one of them, and I can\u2019t impress enough how important it is that we get testing and adequate levels of PPE to keep them and residents safe.\u201d\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it had provided all care homes with 300 masks each and homes struggling can call a national supply disruption response team.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this outbreak. We have provided PPE equipment to over 26,000 care homes including home care providers and hospices across the country.\n\u201cThe full weight of the government is behind this effort and we are working closely with industry and the whole social care sector to make sure staff have the protection they need to continue to deliver care safely.\u201d",

A seven-year-old Greek prodigy has penned an \u201cisolation waltz\u201d inspired by the pandemic.\nThe hypnotic, fugue-like melody has picked up more than 43,000 hits on YouTube since its launch last week.\n\u201cHi guys! I\u2019m Stelios. Let\u2019s be just a teeny bit more patient and we will soon be out swimming in the sea,\u201d he beams, perched on his piano stool, feet barely touching the floor. \u201cI\u2019m dedicating to you a piece of my own.\u201d\nThe work, his third composition, was written especially \u201cfor people who suffer and those who isolate because of Covid-19,\u201d he adds.\nBorn in Athens in 2012 to Fotis and Agathe Kerasidis, both pianists who now teach him, Stelios first performed in public at the age of three.\nIn 2018 he played Chopin\u2019s Waltz in A Minor at New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall, and last year he appeared at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall performing on Elton John\u2019s famous red piano.\nStelios says his favourite pianist is the late Canadian Glenn Gould, best known for his technically demanding renditions of Bach variations.\nThe Greek has shown a flare for composing. His two earlier works were written for his sisters, Veronica and Anastasia, and like Isolation Waltz were met with critical acclaim.\nGreece has been under lockdown for longer than most other European nations, the government having closed schools almost a month ago. Last week the government announced that swimming was also forbidden as the measures were ramped up.\nThe precautionary steps appear to be working: Greece has reported 79 deaths and fewer than 1,800 confirmed coronavirus cases, far fewer than some other countries.\nStelios, who is likely to be homebound for some time yet, has not hinted whether he has another composition up his sleeve.",

He took over its management from Woodford, who had been in charge for the first three years.\nThe board of the Perpetual trust said the decision was not taken lightly and followed \u201can extended period of underperformance\u201d.\nPerpetual\u2019s shares have lost more than 40% of their value in the last three months. Meanwhile, the fund\u2019s total return to shareholders in 2020 was down 38.5%, worse than the 28.9% fall for the FTSE All Share index.\nThe trust\u2019s chairman, Richard Laing, said: \u201cThe board had previously made it clear on several occasions that it was concerned with the company\u2019s poor performance and further intensified scrutiny on the manager\u2019s investment approach. We gave Invesco time to build on the early \u2018Brexit bounce\u2019 that was anticipated, but this proved to be short-lived.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe board is mindful of the market environment, but feel compelled to announce the decision today to replace the manager.\u201d\nThe trust has asked consultancy Mercer and broker Winterflood Securities to find a replacement \u201cwith the credentials and capacity to deliver capital growth and real growth in dividends\u201d.\nIt is another blow to the legacy of former star-stockpicker Woodford, who saw his own investment empire collapse last year following a series of bad market bets. Woodford made his name at Invesco, but set up his own group in 2014 following a 26-year stint at the investment management firm. Barnett took over the management of Woodford\u2019s funds at Invesco following his mentor\u2019s departure.\nInvesco said it was disappointed with the Perpetual trust\u2019s decision: \u201cWe understand the performance pressures that exist in today\u2019s market, but since the half year results we have embraced the board\u2019s views on performance with improved results in the latter part of 2019, consistent with the principle-based approach we have always taken. We are disappointed that we were unable to build on this, given the recent extreme volatility in financial markets.\n\u201cThese are extraordinary times as we all aware, and in our opinion require the experience and expertise of portfolio managers who have weathered severe cyclical shocks.\u201d",

        "content": "The anti-malaria drug could be \u2018one of the biggest game-changers\u2019, Trump claimed, but there is no magic cure\nFaced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak.\nIn March, the US president used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.\u201d\nHe followed this with a tweet that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d. On Sunday Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine, saying \u201cthere are some very strong, powerful signs\u201d of its potential as a Covid-19 therapy.\nTrump has been repeatedly contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who has warned that there is only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful.\nConfronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis, responded by telling reporters that \u201cI\u2019m a smart guy\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve been right a lot\u201d. The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows.\nLast week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug.\nBut with some Americans turning to unconventional, and potentially deadly, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic.\nLast month an Arizona man died and his wife was left in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is related to the composition of the anti-malaria treatment promoted by Trump.\n\u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the woman told NBC, before advising: \u201cDon\u2019t take anything. Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything that the president says and his people \u2026 call your doctor.\u201d\nHere are the key things to know:\nHydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.\nIt is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.\nTrump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.\nHowever, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.\nThe French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, by blocking it from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhea.\nRegardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not.\nThe European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.\nLike many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes.\nWorse, a sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.\nThe latest Chinese research suggests that using hydroxychloroquine is no better than more conventional coronavirus treatments, such as bed rest, antiviral drugs and oxygen inhalation. There are about 40 different research efforts around the world to find a vaccine, which may take a year or more, while scientists rummaging around in the existing medical cabinet have identified some other drugs that may be repurposed to tackle Covid-19. But this work, too, will take time.\nThere is no magic cure for this pandemic, no matter what Trump says.\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

        "content": "Government\u2019s chief marine scientist says he fears people will lose hope for the future of the reef but it is a clear signal for action\nThe government\u2019s top Great Barrier Reef scientist says a third mass bleaching event in five years is a clear signal the marine wonder is \u201ccalling for urgent help\u201d on climate change.\nOne quarter of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer in the most widespread outbreak ever witnessed, according to analysis of aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs released on Tuesday.\nDr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: \u201cMy greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there\u2019s no action.\n\u201cPeople need to see these [bleaching] events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.\u201d\nProf Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights.\nHughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef \u2013 northern, central and southern \u2013 the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998.\nSome 25% of the reefs were severely bleached \u2013 meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached.\nHughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to \u201chigh levels of mortality\u201d of corals.\nThe Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events \u2013 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 \u2013 all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating.\nHughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species.\nThe #GreatBarrierReef has experienced the third mass coral bleaching event in five years, explains @ProfTerryHughes@jcu @CoralCoE @MorganPratchett pic.twitter.com/nAQOQWcgq5\nThe 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said.\nCorals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals.\nHughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef \u2013 from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that \u201clight up like a Christmas tree\u201d when viewed from the air.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.\u201d\nIn February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900.\nSome scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually.\nWachenfeld said the reef\u2019s sheer size \u2013 it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs \u2013 made it resilient, \u201cbut climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before\u201d.\nHe told Guardian Australia: \u201cThree mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate.\n\u201cNo one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.\u201d\nThe globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.\nWachenfeld said: \u201cWe\u2019re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.\u201d\nMeasures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals.\n\u201cNone of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,\u201d Wachenfeld said. \u201cDealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.\u201d\nUnder the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the window we have to aim for,\u201d Wachenfeld said.\n\u201cAs we approach and go beyond 2C, I don\u2019t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef.\n\u201cThe world is heading for 3C of warming \u2013 we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances.\n\u201cThe reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.\u201d\nIn a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: \u201cIt is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience.\n\u201cThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures.\n\u201cThankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.\u201d\nQueensland\u2019s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats \u201care testing the reef\u2019s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.\u201d\nShe said the Palaszczuk government had \u201ccommitted to a zero net emissions target by 2050\u201d and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022.\n\u201cThe missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "For inmates with underlying health conditions contracting the virus could have devastating consequences, say advocates\nAs the coronavirus rages through prisons and jails across the United States, attorneys, advocates and family members of California inmates are urging the state to release older prisoners and inmates with underlying health conditions for whom contracting the virus could have devastating consequences.\nIn response to the coronavirus threat, California has already fast tracked the release of almost 3,500 people serving sentences for nonviolent offenses who were due to be paroled in the next 60 days. The California Department for Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has also taken coronavirus mitigation efforts like barring visitors, increasing facility cleaning and producing hand sanitizer.\nBut cohorts of prosecutors, doctors and criminal justice reformers are calling on state officials to step up their relief efforts for older and vulnerable prisoners, including those serving time for violent offenses.\nAlicia Rhoden\u2019s husband, Bruce Wayne Rhoden, who is serving the final year of a four-year sentence in Wasco state prison for assault with a deadly weapon, also has several violent and drug felony charges dating back to the early 1990s. In addition to his age, Bruce has a bevy of pre-existing conditions, including diabetes and HIV, that make him vulnerable to severe illness and death if infected with the coronavirus. Alicia, who\u2019s 60 and has epilepsy, says she\u2019s frightened that her husband will become ill while in prison and she won\u2019t know until it\u2019s too late.\n\u201cMy husband is 61 and his health isn\u2019t good at all,\u201d Alicia Rhoden, a Los Angeles resident, said. \u201cMy fear is that he can die in prison because of his medical conditions.\u201d\n\u201cHe needs a lot of care,\u201d she added. \u201cHe takes six insulin shots a day and needs his antivirals.\u201d\nHoping to force the state to focus relief efforts on sick incarcerated people and those over 50, attorneys with the Prison Law Office and Rosen, Bien, Galvan & Grunfeld sought to modify an existing court order that mandates California to reduce its prison population.\n\u201cExcluding lifers who have served long periods of time and people with violent offenses is a waste of human life,\u201d said Michael Bien, one of attorneys who filed the emergency motion. \u201cPeople make horrible mistakes but how many years must someone stay in a dangerous situation to make up for the horrible mistake?\u201d\nOver the weekend, a three-judge panel denied the emergency motion. According to the written decision, the judges agreed that the state must act swiftly, but that the original prison reduction order \u201cwas never intended to prepare Defendants to confront this unprecedented pandemic\u201d and could therefore not be modified in light of the coronavirus.\nNow, Bien says his office and the Prison Law Office will take the motion to a single judge and seek an order to transfer high-risk people out of prisons and into empty state facilities or home confinement in lieu of full releases.\n\u201cThe best outcome isn\u2019t a victory in court but a victory in reducing density. We\u2019re hoping this message to the governors\u2019 office is taken seriously,\u201d said Bien.\nAs of 5 April, 16 inmates and 53 staff members at the CDCR have tested positive for Covid-19. While that number is small compared to the 48 cases and one death in a single Illinois prison and the nearly 200 cases at Rikers Island in New York, advocates worry that it\u2019s just a matter of time before prisons in California see dozens of confirmed cases.\nThe CDCR houses around 116,000 inmates in prisons and camps, according to their most recent population report. Almost 5,600 are 65 or older and 37% of the total prison population have at least one of the risk factors that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says put them at risk of severe illness from Covid-19.\nAge and underlying conditions combined with the lack of space in prisons are a \u201cperfect storm of why this population should be released early\u201d, said David Muhammad, the executive director of the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, of older prisoners.\n\u201cThey\u2019re most at risk, they cost the most to incarcerate and care for, and have the lowest risk of recidivating,\u201d Muhammad continued. (Federal inmates who were released after the age of 60 had a less than 10% reincarceration rate compared to over 30% for people under 30, according to a 2017 United States Sentencing Commission report.)\nIn a 31 March response to Bien\u2019s motion, attorneys for the state say CDCR officials have \u201calready taken immediate, bold and appropriate steps in response to this rapidly evolving crisis\u201d. The measures include moving around 500 people from dormitories, which are open spaces with bunk beds that hold dozens of inmates, to prisons with available space. They\u2019ve also suspended intake from county jails, a process that usually brings 3,000 new people into the CDCR\u2019s 35 adult institutions per month.\nA spokesperson for the CDCR told the Guardian in an email that these steps along with the recent releases will, \u201chelp create physical distancing for all inmates, thereby reducing the risk of spread of Covid-19 among the entire population\u201d.\nBut many worry that the state\u2019s exclusion of people who have committed violent crimes \u2013 almost half of the CDCR population according to a 2018 department report \u2013 won\u2019t reduce the elderly population enough to avoid an outbreak.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk to public safety if you don\u2019t reduce the population, not the other way around,\u201d said Adnan Khan, who after spending 16 years in San Quentin state prison became the executive director of justice reform not-for-profit Re:Store Justice.\nKhan, who was released in January 2019, says he stays in daily contact with friends that are still incarcerated, including his 68-year-old mentor. Khan recalls a recent conversation where his mentor matter of factly told Khan that he and other prisoners are, \u201cJust waiting to get the coronavirus. Those who survive do, and those who don\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d\nState officials say that releasing people from incarceration is a complicated process that begins more than six months before someone is allowed to walk out the prison\u2019s gates. This process includes assessing post-release needs and getting people set up with state-funded benefits as needed. They argue that these pre-release plans are necessary to ensure that people can thrive post-incarceration and that this process should remain in the hands of corrections officials, not state courts.\nStill, people like Khan and Rhoden worry that as the legal battle wears on, their loved ones will become more at risk while behind bars.\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s not young, and I\u2019m worried about her getting sick there,\u201d said Tamisha Torres, a re-entry service provider in California\u2019s Contra Costa county.\nTorres\u2019 mother is 55 years old and incarcerated in Folsom state prison, about 30 miles from Sacramento, after hitting a California Highway Patrol officer while he was helping with a collision. She was accepted into one of the CDCR\u2019s 3 Alternative Custody Programs, which are private residences or CDCR facilities with rehabilitative programs, to serve the rest of her sentence. But the rapid spread of coronavirus has prompted CDCR officials to stop the transfer of the people from prisons to these facilities. So Torres\u2019 mother is continuing to work in the prison while she awaits her transfer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating when you get a notice that you\u2019re gonna be released and then it\u2019s like \u2018Oops sorry, the bus isn\u2019t coming\u2019,\u201d said Torres.\n\u201cNow my mom has to decide: \u2018Am I going to go to work and risk getting sick in this place or am I not gonna have what I need to be comfortable here?\u2019 If you\u2019re in prison and don\u2019t have someone taking care of you then going to work and getting that 35 cents an hour is everything,\u201d Torres continued.\n\u201cOne of my concerns is my husband getting sick and no one telling me. I just find out that he\u2019s dead, it gives me fear \u2013 that I might not know,\u201d said Rhoden.\n\u201cAnd Bruce gets frightened because he doesn\u2019t know if something happened to me. I\u2019m epileptic and have 10 seizures a week. If I get too sick there will be no one to advocate for him,\u201d continued Rhoden.\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying the price for mass incarceration in the United States,\u201d echoed Bien. \u201cThis is a harsh lesson for all of us on how dangerous our systems are. It\u2019s terrible for the people incarcerated, it\u2019s terrible for the staff.\u201d\nClarification: this story has been updated with more detailed information about Torres\u2019 and Rhoden\u2019s convictions.",

        "content": "Repeated denials of prime minister\u2019s worsening condition now coming under scrutiny\nThe first indication that Boris Johnson was sicker with coronavirus than either he or his aides were letting on came on Thursday morning. The suggestion made by a source was specific: a bed was being prepared at St Thomas\u2019 hospital for the prime minister, whose condition had worsened during his seven-day period of isolation in Downing Street.\nIt did not take long for rumours to spread. A Conservative backbencher had heard a similar story, this time suggesting Johnson may have even already been admitted to the hospital across the Thames from Westminster, and passed the tip to the Guardian at about the same time. Together it was more than enough to prompt an urgent inquiry to No 10.\nIn reply, Johnson\u2019s aides were emphatic. His condition had not deteriorated, he still had only \u201cmild symptoms\u201d, he hoped to be at work from Friday when his coronavirus isolation period was up - and he had not been admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital for treatment. When on Monday evening it emerged that contrary to reassurances about him getting on with his red box, he was being admitted to intensive care, the denials were coming under increasing scrutiny.\nJohnson, 55, had spent the week since testing positive for coronavirus holed up in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, while his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds - who has herself been unwell - was becoming increasingly concerned about his health.\nThe prime minister hoped to keep his period of isolation to a minimum, trying to govern the country via video conference calls and email, all the while still coughing and with his overall condition failing to improve.\nMeanwhile, the mood in Downing Street was darkening during a difficult week in which it was becoming clear that the government was struggling to hit a target of 10,000 coronavirus tests a day, even prompting the unwell prime minister on Wednesday to promise that he would take personal charge of the issue.\nKey advisers such as Dominic Cummings, his chief aide, were not at No 10 because they too were ill and isolating, while criticism was being levelled at the health secretary, Matt Hancock, himself only back at work on Thursday after developing symptoms.\n\u201cOther ministers feel he\u2019s been getting the government in trouble by over-promising on testing, and not interrogating his civil servants enough,\u201d according to one well-connected Tory aide, who is close to key figures at No 10.\nThere was also criticism of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the leading figure in Downing Street in Johnson\u2019s and Cummings\u2019s absence. \u201cSedwill seems to be amassing power, even though you have to be questioning how effective the civil service has been in tackling coronavirus so far. And all the while, was he looking out properly for the prime minister?\u201d the aide added, although it is hard to know if even the country\u2019s most senior official could have persuaded Johnson to recuperate earlier.\nOn Thursday lunchtime, having denied the first round of rumours about St Thomas\u2019, Downing Street floated the idea that Johnson might not be back at work on Friday as planned if his temperature remained high.\nA cough was not mentioned, but his official spokesman told a daily briefing with journalists that he would only go back to work the next day if his temperature came down.\nThat evening at 8pm, despite his isolation, the prime minister appeared at the door of No 10 to applaud the work of NHS workers. Despite the appearance, the health rumours did not go away: St Thomas\u2019 was on standby because Johnson\u2019s condition had worsened, the first source insisted - only for Downing Street, when pressed, to deny that he was about to be admitted that night.\nOn Friday lunchtime, the situation began to unravel. An unkempt, gravelly-voiced and clearly unwell Johnson released a video in which he said, somewhat implausibly, \u201cI\u2019m feeling better,\u201d before conceding he could not fully return to work. \u201cAlas, I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,\u201d he insisted.\nOn Saturday he spoke to newly elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to invite him \u201cto a briefing next week\u201d on the crisis, but on Sunday his health apparently took a turn. At about 7.30pm that evening, Johnson was rushed by car to the hospital.\nAbout 90 minutes later, Downing Street went public, saying Johnson had been \u201cadmitted to hospital for tests\u201d on the advice of his doctor and, in a change of language, acknowledged the prime minister was suffering from \u201cpersistent\u201d rather than mild symptoms.\nShortly before 8.30pm on Monday, further news came: the prime minister had been admitted to intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 90 minutes earlier.\nSeveral sources say Johnson has required oxygen to help with his breathing following his admission to hospital - an assertion that was not denied by Downing Street - although his official spokesman said that Russian reports that he was on a ventilator were \u201cdisinformation\u201d. Those who know Symonds, 32, say she is worried: \u201cShe\u2019s ringing up friends, telling them how anxious she is.\u201d\nAt the daily press briefing on Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after Johnson\u2019s admission to hospital, little extra detail was offered.\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who has now taken over temporarily with Johnson incapacitated, would only repeat that the prime minister \u201chad a comfortable night\u201d and was \u201cin good spirits\u201d.\nSome Conservative MPs are worried that Downing Street\u2019s evasiveness on the seriousness of the prime minister\u2019s condition will undermine trust in what they say going forward.",

        "content": "Overall charge of government handed to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary\nBoris Johnson has spent the night in intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened, with overall charge of the government handed to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary.\nIn an unprecedented development during a public health crisis, the prime minister was moved to intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital, London, at 7pm on Monday as a precaution in case he needed ventilation, it was said. He remained conscious on Monday night.\nA No 10 spokesman said: \u201cOver the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.\n\u201cThe prime minister has asked foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.\u201d\nIntensive care beds are reserved for those who are very ill, and in the case of Covid-19, often those who need to be put on a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Since first being admitted to St Thomas\u2019 on Sunday evening, Johnson, 55, is understood to have received oxygen through a non-invasive mask only.\nHis pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms \u2013 was said to be deeply anxious about Johnson\u2019s condition.\nNews of his hospitalisation, 11 days after he developed a cough and high temperature, caused national and international concern, with world leaders from US president Donald Trump to French president Emmanuel Macron sending their best wishes and support for Johnson\u2019s recovery.\nTrump said: \u201cWe\u2019re very saddened to hear that [Johnson] was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special: strong resolute, doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d\nHe said he had asked two companies offering treatment for coronavirus to contact London \u201cimmediately\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve really advanced therapeutics ... and they have arrived in London already, the London office has whatever they need. We\u2019ll see if we can be of help. We\u2019ve contacted all of Boris\u2019s doctors, and we\u2019ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go.\u201d\nShortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an \u201cincredibly strong team spirit\u201d behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place.\nHe said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic.\nBuckingham Palace said of the Queen: \u201cHer Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.\u201d\nThe decision to hand over power to Raab, 46, was taken after concern in the cabinet and among MPs that Johnson should have been resting instead of working. It also comes amid suggestions that the seriousness of the prime minster\u2019s coronavirus symptoms \u2013 including a persistent cough and high temperature - were being underplayed by himself and his aides.\nAt midday on Monday, Downing Street was still insisting that the prime minister was able to read his red box of government papers, and at the daily 5pm press conference, Raab claimed Johnson was still fully in charge and issuing instructions.\nNo 10 had insisted earlier on Monday that Johnson was only in hospital as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d and for \u201croutine tests\u201d, having said up until his admission on Sunday evening that he was suffering from mild symptoms.\nClaims that his condition had not deteriorated came under increased scrutiny after it emerged that a bed at St Thomas\u2019 was being prepared for Johnson as early as Thursday last week. He spent Sunday night on an empty wing that is normally used for elective procedures, a source said, before being moved to intensive care on Monday evening.\nBefore his move to intensive care, the Guardian was told of frustration among ministers over Johnson remaining in charge for so long rather than resting, even after he had received oxygen treatment having failed to shake off Covid-19 symptoms for 11 days.\nIt came as the UK death toll from coronavirus exceeded 5,000 for the first time, rising by 439 to 5,373. The daily reported increase fell for the second day in a row, but a Department of Health source cautioned that this can be due to lower reporting at weekends and said the trend needs to be lower during the week to be a cause for optimism.\nAt the daily Downing Street press conference at 5pm, Raab said it remained the case that Johnson was \u201cin charge, he is leading and giving instructions as and when required\u201d.\nHowever, he later admitted not having spoken to Johnson since Saturday \u2013 the day before the prime minister\u2019s admission to hospital on medical advice.\nNo 10 insisted it had been \u201ctransparent throughout\u201d about Johnson\u2019s medical condition, despite having claimed up until the point of his hospital admission that his symptoms were \u201cmild\u201d. His spokesman dropped that description on Monday, saying instead that his cough and temperature were \u201cpersistent\u201d.\nTwo ministers, James Duddridge and Nadine Dorries, suggested Johnson needed time to recuperate. Duddridge said it was important for the prime minister to now \u201crest, look after yourself and let the others do the heavy [lifting]\u201d.\nBut Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and a friend of the prime minister, said he had good reasons for not wanting to step away until now.\nHe told the BBC: \u201cHis first thought has not actually been for himself, it has been in a sense for the British people. He doesn\u2019t want the British people to feel in any way overly concerned and worried. He wants them to be calm, which goes to the nature of the individual he is.\u201d\nDuncan Smith also attempted to calm fears around Johnson\u2019s admission, saying the public \u201cshouldn\u2019t over-read the going into intensive care\u201d.\n\u201cI am certain that the doctors will have done this to make sure that they can stabilise him completely so they can treat whatever he may have. As I say, he may have a strong secondary infection which needs to be treated and treated rather urgently,\u201d he said.\nAfter the prime minister\u2019s hospital admission, Raab led the daily coronavirus morning meeting, known internally as the \u201cwar cabinet\u201d. But several cabinet sources said there was a worry that Johnson\u2019s refusal to let go of power had been causing impotence at the top of government.\nDominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s most senior adviser, is also isolating with coronavirus symptoms and has not yet returned to work.\nWhile the prime minister has been in self-isolation for over a week, reported tensions between Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, emerged over the competing demands of the health impacts of coronavirus and its effects on the economy. Tory sources insisted any problems were largely at the level of officials.\nMeanwhile, No 10 and the Department of Health have been frustrated with both NHS England, for allegedly failing to share data quickly enough at \u201csit-rep\u201d [situation reports] meetings on the state of services, and Public Health England, for not agreeing to look to private firms for outside testing capacity quickly enough.\nChris Whitty, the chief medical officer, also said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d and a \u201cmistake\u201d to have a \u201cserious discussion about all the things we need to do step-by-step to move to the next phase of managing this\u201d without the UK having seen a peak in cases.\nHe also stressed the government would need to balance many factors in deciding whether to ease the lockdown. These include people dying directly from the virus itself, dying indirectly if the NHS became overwhelmed with cases, the effects of postponing other types of healthcare because of coronavirus, and the long-term health impact on people due to social and economic reasons.",

        "content": "The forward talks about how his club have helped players, missing family in Portugal and his boyhood team\nDiogo Jota has not been making headlines recently because, like most people, he has been observing the British government\u2019s lockdown. But in the simpler time before football and society were placed into suspended animation, Jota looked to be building towards something sensational.\nHis devastating bursts from the left side of Wolves\u2019 attacks brought six goals in five matches before the hiatus, taking his tally for the season to 15 goals. Wolves were well placed in both the Premier League and the Europa League. Then the whole world pressed pause and none of that was important.\nJota has no complaints, he understands. As he and everyone else wait for the pandemic to subside, the 23-year-old agreed to reflect on his career and the season so far. What harm can that do? He talked about his and Wolves\u2019 improvement, as well as Liverpool\u2019s title credentials and the unique impact made by his Portuguese compatriot Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United.\nFirst, though, he said how strange it is to be so far from his family in Portugal at a time of crisis while acknowledging he has a lot for which to be thankful, nonetheless. \u201cIf I was in Portugal it might be even more difficult to manage, as I would be closer to them and the temptation to have social contacts would be greater,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBeing here, that is harder, and [staying indoors] is what we must do. I obviously hope my family does not receive bad news and I try to pass on to them all the messages that I get from the club: to avoid leaving home unless it is extremely necessary. The goal is for us all to be together again once this situation ends.\u201d\nWolves were the first top-flight club to close their stadium following the suspension of the league with their chairman, Jeff Shi, saying his ties to China made him \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the dangers of the coronavirus and immediately pledging to ensure all staff continue to be paid throughout this \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d. The company that owns the club, Fosun, donated 2,300 coverall and face masks to local hospitals.\nThe players, meanwhile, have been benefiting from an enviable level of care. \u201cThe club have helped us in everything,\u201d said Jota. \u201cThe club managed to find a basket with all kinds of food, so we don\u2019t have to go shopping. And in the medical area, we were given a kit with everything we need. I\u2019m talking about masks, hand sanitiser and everything. The club does everything in their power so that we don\u2019t miss anything.\u201d\nAs for keeping fit before the notional resumption of the season, \u201cthe coaching staff drew up a plan for this first stage, which is said to last until the end of April but from the looks of it, it will last beyond that\u201d, Jota told the Portuguese newspaper Record. \u201cWe have an individual work plan, with the idea of being as close to our best shape as possible.\u201d\nFor Jota, football is a passion that never stops. So during his confinement he has been playing a virtual version of it. \u201cI happen to be training Telford United on Football Manager. I\u2019m already in 2029.\u201d Being a playtime coach makes him appreciate all the more the work that Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Wolves\u2019 backroom have done in real life to lift the club to where they are now from the Championship, which is where they were when Jota joined from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2017, initially on loan.\n\u201cDetaching myself from it, you understand more clearly why this and that happened the way it did,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is clearly influence from the coaching staff. From the physical part, where Antonio [Dias] helps us a lot. Then we have a mental coach, Julio [Figueroa], who helps us a lot too. We know that for every problem we face we will always have someone related to that specific area who can help us.\n\u201cFor example, if we look at last season compared to this one, we see that we have been changing the tactical system a few times, adapting to the opposing teams, taking away from them any chance of breaking our system. And with these systems enhancing our qualities, we players have to adapt and help the team as well as possible.\u201d\nJota also admires work done at other clubs. He would have no quibble with Liverpool being crowned champions if this season were to be cancelled. \u201cIf we were to have the misfortune of not being able to end the season, I think that few people would oppose this. Of course, there are always rival clubs that could be against that but I think 95% of people would agree. For me they would be fair champions.\u201d\nWhich is not to say that Liverpool are his favourite Merseyside club. When he was growing up in Portugal, the English team he most enjoyed watching wore blue. \u201cI loved to watch Everton play, especially when they were playing at home. It was not a club that fought for the title but that always made life very complicated for the big teams. And I loved that drive and competitiveness. They were relentless.\u201d\nAttitude is a quality Jota cherishes as much as skill. He reckons Fernandes, for instance, has uplifted Manchester United by inspiring the club\u2019s other players to raise their standards. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is the best [player at United] but he\u2019s the most ambitious. And that makes a difference.\n\u201cYou can clearly see the difference between United with and without Bruno Fernandes. He takes on the responsibility and aspires for more than what they are doing. I think they owe him a lot already. And that is not only related to his quality, but also to his ambition and personality.\u201d",

And it\u2019s probably the number one concern for health workers around the country at the moment.\nGuardian Australia has previously reported fears of shortages of PPE in the health system as the number of cases of Covid-19 rises across Australia. Rural Aboriginal medical services in particular face a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d shortage.\nMonday\u2019s Q+A, dedicated to the experiences of frontline healthcare workers, revealed significant concern among doctors about the shortage.\nVyom Sharma, a general practitioner from Victoria, said his practice was down to about 10 surgical masks and suggested the federal government should have done more to source supplies sooner.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to save them for when we really need them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd the concern is it\u2019s actually affecting the nature of care we can provide. We are transitioning to telehealth at the moment, offering face-to-face consultations when required. But they have to be reduced in a way that\u2019s commensurate to the supply we have available.\n\u201cIt\u2019s correct what Steven [Parnis] said, we\u2019re very worried about the lack of personal protective equipment and it\u2019s been affecting the care we\u2019ve been offering patients throughout. When the criteria for Covid-19 had been changing gradually through February and March, a huge percentage of my population were overseas students and travellers and tourists.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re rationing masks even then. And there are people coughing and sneezing one day who come from South Korea or Italy and a few day later the criteria changes and it says these people are high risk and you wonder \u2018should I have used a mask on them and I would have if I had enough\u2019.\u201d\nLucy Morgan, a respiratory physician from Sydney\u2019s Nepean hospital, said she was \u201creassured\u201d by work done to supply public hospitals with PPE as the number of Covid-19 cases began to quickly escalate in March. But, she said, healthcare workers in other areas including GPs and specialists in private practice could find it harder to source equipment.\n\u201cTheir access to protective gear is a little bit less secure. I think they have, they haven\u2019t got the same bargaining power or purchasing power that hospitals or health departments have. And I think that\u2019s another challenge for us,\u201d she said.\nAlso on Monday, shadow minister for health Chris Bowen criticised the Ruby Princess fiasco after the death of a 12th former passenger of the cruise ship.\n\u201cThere has to be a full explanation to the Australian people about how Border Force let that happen. It is just unacceptable.\u201d\nLiberal MP Katie Allen said she was pleased that New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller had launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess case \u201cso that we can get to the bottom of actually what happened\u201d.\nA former medical researcher, Allen said the government had been increasing hospital capacity in preparation for more cases of the virus.\n\u201cAs a government, we\u2019re being very careful about looking at ventilator capacity and we\u2019re also bringing more nurses online because those intensive care beds need 24-hour care and we do need more nurses,\u201d she said.\n\u201c[We are] bringing more people into the workforce to make sure we\u2019re ready for a possibility that may actually not actually eventuate but we need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.\u201d",

        "content": "Staff told to \u2018hold their breath\u2019 due to lack of masks, survey by Doctors\u2019 Association UK finds\nDoctors in Britain are being \u201cbullied and shamed\u201d into treating patients with Covid-19 despite not having the masks, gowns and eyewear they need to protect themselves from the virus, frontline medics have said.\nOthers are being told to hold their breath to avoid getting infected because of persistent shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) .\nThe findings raise questions about how far a huge effort by NHS bosses, ministers and the military has succeeded in banishing previously widespread supply problems with PPE.\n\u201cLack of personal protective equipment continues to be a critical issue. It is heartbreaking to hear that some staff have been told to simply \u2018hold their breath\u2019 due to lack of masks,\u201d said Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, the president of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK).\n\u201cDoctors are dying. Nurses are dying. We are devastated, and can no longer stand by and watch as more dedicated colleagues lose their life,\u201d she said.\nAt least three NHS doctors, two nurses and one midwife have died already after contracting coronavirus.\nThe DAUK has begun collating anonymous reports from its network of frontline medics about continuing shortages of PPE, which has created confusion, alarm and fear among staff. It has developed an app with a firm called Messly to log shortages.\nBased on 500 reports so far from 193 hospital trusts and GP practices, the DAUK says that:\n72% of doctors cannot get hold of an FFP3 mask when they need one.\n77% report shortages of long-sleeved gowns.\n43% cannot always use a visor or goggles when they need them.\nThe findings also indicate that protective kit is still in short supply for doctors undertaking \u201caerosol generating procedures\u201d on Covid-19 patients, such as intubating them, where potentially dangerous droplets are expelled from their mouths.\nAlmost half (49%) of medics performing such procedures cannot always access a gown, 42% an FFP3 mask and 20% proper eye protection, DAUK found.\nHowever, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) said a combination of revised PPE guidance issued last week by Public Health England, and the NHS drive to get millions more pieces of kit to the frontline, had made a big impact on the shortages and helped allay staff\u2019s fears.\n\u201cThings are much better than they were a week ago. People on the ground are saying that it\u2019s getting better, though there are still some distribution issues within hospitals,\u201d said Dr Andrew Goddard, president of the RCP, which represents mainly hospital doctors in England.\nPublic Health England\u2019s \u201cmuch clearer\u201d new advice had helped banish the \u201cconfusion\u201d many staff felt about what PPE they should wear in certain medical settings in order to reduce their risk, he added.\n\u201cIn a survey we ran last week, 22% of staff said they didn\u2019t have access to the PPE they needed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat is adding to the anxiety and emotional challenge of working in these settings, as working on Covid wards is a scary situation. That 22% needs to become 0% as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe Twickenham MP Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health spokeswoman, said: \u201cIt is absolutely shocking to hear from medical professionals about the risks they are having to take in providing care for our loved ones and the fear they have of speaking up regarding the availability of appropriate PPE.\n\u201cDespite promises from ministers, it\u2019s clear that our frontline health and care workforce still do not have adequate supplies of the correct protective equipment.\n\u201cIt is simply unacceptable that so many staff feel they are being put in harm\u2019s way due to shortages of essential kit, in turn risking the health of their loved ones and other patients. They should not need to rely on crowdfunding, donations from schools and makeshift visors to do these critical roles.\u201d\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working around the clock to give the NHS, social care and other public services the equipment and support they need to tackle this outbreak.\n\u201cOver the weekend we delivered over 34 million pieces of PPE to NHS trusts in England, including over 8.8 million aprons, and 7 million face masks, and we have created a 24-hour hotline which NHS Trusts can call to raise any supply issues.\u201d\nA separate survey by the British Medical Association (BMA) also found that doctors working in high-risk environments with Covid-positive patients are finding it hard to get the right PPE.\nIts survey of over 1,500 medics found that more than half working in such settings reported a lack of face masks, while 65% could not get adequate eye protection. Over half (56%) said they felt pressurised to work in areas involving higher risk of infection despite a shortage of PPE.\nOne hospital doctor told the BMA: \u201cThe quality of our eye protection and apron is useless. Some of the PPE provided feels like a tick-box exercise just for psychological reassurance.\u201d\nAnd one GP said: \u201cI feel betrayed by the government who are not transparent enough to say that they do not have the ideal supplies and therefore are asking us to put ourselves in harm\u2019s way with suboptimal protection.\u201d",

        "content": "David Clark called himself an \u2018idiot\u2019 for driving his family 20km to the beach on the first weekend of the national stay-at-home measures \nNew Zealand\u2019s health minister has been demoted after he ignored national lockdown rules and drove his family to a beach 20km from his home.\nLast week Dr David Clark was photographed going for a mountain bike ride 2km away from his Dunedin home. He apologised for the incident, saying it showed poor judgment at a time when all New Zealanders were being urged to stay at home and only exercise in their local area.\nNow Clark has revealed a further indiscretion, calling himself an \u201cidiot\u201d for deciding to drive his family 20km to the Doctor\u2019s Point beach on the first weekend of lockdown.\nLockdown rules state cars should only be used to purchase essential supplies such as food or medicine, and exercise should be taken in the local area only.\nClark said the revelation came about as part of his preparation for appearing in front of the epidemic response committee on Tuesday, requiring him to provide prime minister Jacinda Ardern \u201cwith a complete picture of my activity outside my home during alert level 4\u201d.\nClark said the beach trip during level 4 lockdown was a clear breach, and he had offered his resignation to Ardern \u2013 who had not accepted it.\n\u201cAt a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices I\u2019ve let the team down. I\u2019ve been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,\u201d Clark said in a statement.\n\u201cAs the health minister, it\u2019s my responsibility to not only follow the rules but set an example to other New Zealanders \u2026 I\u2019ve apologised to the prime minister for my lack of judgement and offered her my resignation.\nArdern responded swiftly to Clark\u2019s revelation, stripping him of his associate finance minister portfolio and demoting him to the bottom of the cabinet rankings.\nPolitical commentators say it is likely Clark will lose the health portfolio when the coronavirus crisis is resolved, and criticised him for failing to show his face regularly or taking on more of a leadership role, leaving that job to Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health.\n\u201cUnder normal conditions, I would sack the minister of health. What he did was wrong, and there are no excuses,\u201d Ardern said in a statement.\n\u201cBut right now, my priority is our collective fight against Covid-19. We cannot afford massive disruption in the health sector or to our response. For that reason, and that reason alone, Dr Clark will maintain his role.\u201d\n\u201cBut he does need to pay a price. He broke the rules.\u201d\nArdern said New Zealanders expected their ministers to uphold the rules that they themselves had set, which were trying circumstances for everyone to adhere too.\nUnder level 4 lockdown, which New Zealanders have been under for nearly two weeks, Kiwis cannot leave their homes except for essential supplies such as food or medicine, and could only take brief bouts of exercise in their local area.\n\u201cI expect better, and so does New Zealand,\u201d Ardern said.\nClark is not the only high-profile New Zealander to flout the rules. All Blacks first five Richie Mo\u2019unga has apologised after he was filmed kicking and passing a rugby ball with other professional players at his local park.\n\u201cI want to start off by saying this was not an organised training. There were no communications beforehand saying that we should train in this park together. It was by coincidence that I rocked up and they were there training,\u201d Mo\u2019unga said on social media, but the prime minister and NZ rugby have both criticised the meet-up.\nMo\u2019unga went on to say he intended to run around the park alone, but \u201cinstinct\u201d made him pick up the rugby ball.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve learnt that even [though it was] my natural instincts, it\u2019s something I need to be more careful of and I will be more careful of.\u201d\nCases of coronavirus have begun to stabilise and decline in New Zealand, with experts saying the country may be the only western nation with a chance of totally eradicating the disease.\n\u201cThis does suggest that what we are doing as a nation is working,\u201d Ardern said at her daily media briefing.\n\u201cWe do appear at this early stage to be on track\u201d\nFifty-four new cases of the virus were confirmed on Tuesday, bringing the total to 1,160. One person has died from the virus, an older woman with pre-existing health conditions on the west coast of the South Island.\nTwelve people are being treated for the virus in hospital, with four of those requiring intensive care. On Tuesday more people recovered from the illness than contracted it, the director-general of health said, an encouraging milestone.",

Just 73% of men increased hygiene measures compared with 83% of women. Some 75% of men stopped hugging and handshaking, compared with 82% of women.\nThe proportion of voters who trust the government is giving honest and objective advice rose from 56% on 22 March to 63% last Monday.\nTrust in the media to provide honest and objective information about Covid-19 jumped from 35% to 51% over the same two-week period.\nYounger voters aged 18-34 \u2013 the least vulnerable to the coronavirus \u2013 are more likely than others to be critical of the response to it. Essential Research found 28% believed the response has been an overreaction.\nJust 11% of the voters most at risk from the infection, those aged 55+, think there has been an overreaction; 47% in this cohort consider the response has been about right, and 42% think the threat is being underestimated.\nThe menace of the virus remains strong with 41% of all voters fearing they are very likely or somewhat likely to become a victim.\nStrikingly, the most fatalistic age group is 18-34, of whom 49% say they are very or somewhat likely to catch Covid-19. That compares with those aged 55+, medically the most likely to be struck down, of whom 34% say they are likely to be victims.\nSome 70% of voters believe they have been kept informed on the situation and the impact on families, according to the Essential Research. This compared with 63% just a week earlier.\nAnd in a sign of confidence, some 52% of voters believe their finances will not be affected by the impact of the coronavirus, or that their savings will see them through.\nBut the dominant view, from 51%, was that the economy will be in trouble for six to 12 months, and grow slowly after that.\nHouseholds with dependent children are more worried about their financial futures, with 36% fearing they will struggle with a short-term loss of income, and a further 19% expecting to suffer serious financial stress.",

He wanted to help out even in a small way,\u201d said a spokesperson.\nVaradkar, 41, worked as a junior doctor in Dublin and qualified as a GP in 2010 before quitting medicine to become a full-time politician, and later becoming premier.\nHis return to medicine adds him to an eclectic group of public figures who have dusted off credentials to work as nurses and doctors in Europe\u2019s battle against the pandemic.\nCoronavirus has made thousands of frontline health care workers ill and left many others unable to work because they need to stay at home to care for children or self-isolate because of potential infection. Health services across the continent have appealed to trainees, retirees and expatriates \u2013 anyone with useful skills \u2013 to help fill the gap.\nFor Thomas Lilti, 43, a film director and showrunner, was filming the French medical TV drama Hippocrate in a hospital when the pandemic struck. He suspended filming and a few days later started working as a doctor \u2013 a profession he had quit in 2014 \u2013 in the same hospital.\n\u201cI volunteered in casualty to try and help in a small way so the more competent doctors, those who really know what they are doing, can have a rest even if just for a few hours,\u201d he told Le Journal du Dimanche.\nFrench sports figures have also reverted to former professions. St\u00e9phanie dos Santos, 28, a basketballer, and Julien Mathieu, a ju-jitsu champion, are working as nurses. Thomas Carabas, 31, a rugby referee, has returned to work at Bayonne hospital.\nPoliticians across Europe \u2013 and the political spectrum \u2013 have also responded.\nKatalin Cseh, 31, an MEP for Hungary\u2019s opposition Momentum party, has returned from Brussels to Budapest and is to start her first shift as a volunteer medic on Tuesday.\nCseh expressed concern about Hungary\u2019s low level of testing and potential abuse of a new law against misinformation but volunteered \u201cto show a good example\u201d, she said. She will work part-time and unpaid while continuing to serve as an MEP.\nIn France, Thomas Mesnier, 34, an MP for the governing La R\u00e9publique en Marche, has returned to hospital work. Caroline Fiat, 43, an MP for La France Insoumise, has returned to work as a nurse. Bernard Jomier, 56, a Socialist party senator, and V\u00e9ronique Guillotin, 57, a Radical Movement senator, have returned to the medical profession as doctors.\nIn Northern Ireland, Kathryn Owen, 42, a Democratic Unionist party (DUP) councillor, is to resume working as a nurse this week at a hospital site that treats coronavirus patients.

        "content": "Group, aged 11-21 at the time, sue Sisters of the Good Shepherd over treatment by nuns\nNineteen women are suing a Dutch monastery and its Catholic order over claims they were subjected to forced labour and abuse by nuns between 1951 and 1979 during periods of virtual imprisonment as children or young adults.\nThe case against the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, which operates in 70 countries, concerns the treatment of women, aged 11 to 21 at the time, who had been placed in the nuns\u2019 care by the courts or at the request of their parents or guardians.\nThe women, who are now in their 70s and 80s, say they were forced to work in laundries and sewing and ironing rooms under threat of punishment, against their will and without wages, for the order or for the benefit of outside organisations including the Dutch royal house.\nJoke de Smit, 74, who stayed in Good Shepherd institutions in Bloemendaal and Zoeterwoude for four years from the age of 15, told the Guardian: \u201cThey ruined my life. That needs some form of reparation. That\u2019s why we will go to court.\u201d\nWhen De Smit obtained her child protection file as an adult, the nuns had written of her that she had a \u201cnice little face\u201d. They added: \u201cIt is a pity that she is rotten through and through.\u201d\nTiny Holstein-Fiolet, 85, who was in the care of the nuns between 1951 and 1952, remembers as a 20-year-old being ordered to look at the ceiling and say prayers while showering as it was deemed unchaste to look at her own body or that of others.\nShe said: \u201cI need recognition of all that was done to me. Finally we\u2019re able to tell our story, that\u2019s why we go to court, to tell our story. People need to know the truth, that we are not making it all up.\u201d\nAt least 15,000 girls and young women, accused of falling into \u201clicentiousness\u201d, were held in confinement and forced to work in the laundry and sewing rooms of the Catholic order of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd in the Netherlands between 1860 and the early 1980s.\nSimilar claims of abuse have been made of monasteries run by the same order in the US, Australia and Ireland, where they were also known as the Magdalene laundries.\nAn additional claimant in the Netherlands to the 19 women is the Clara Wichman Foundation, a non-profit organisation, which is acting on behalf of all of those not represented.\nThe women under the care of the nuns in the Netherlands were said to have been instilled with the belief that they were \u201cinferior\u201d, \u201cimperfect\u201d, and \u201cincorrigible\u201d. They have said they did not receive a proper education and were beaten.\nBeyond delivering corporal punishment, the nuns were not permitted to touch those in their care, who were said to have been denied medical care and the basic requirements of \u201cpersonal hygiene, privacy, warmth and tranquility\u201d.\nOnly one of the 19 women was aware of the reason behind her being sent to the monastery. In that case it was because of the \u201cunsustainable\u201d financial situation at her mother\u2019s home.\nA Dutch government investigation report published in 2019 concluded that the situation in the monasteries amounted to forced labour. Each woman was offered \u20ac5,000 by the state for its role in placing the girls in seven Dutch institutions run by the order.\nThe Sisters of the Good Shepherd has apologised to the claimants, accepting that the circumstances under which the girls were received had been \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\nThe sisters dispute the facts as presented by plaintiffs and disclaims liability, citing the statute of limitations.\nThe claimants\u2019 lawyers, Liesbeth Zegveld and Brechtje Vossenberg, said their clients wanted recognition of the unlawfulness of their treatment. \u201cThe superior attitude the Sisters of the Good Shepherd still take sharply contrasts the continual suffering of the women,\u201d Zegveld said.\n\u201cFinally these women have the courage to go to court and demand recognition of the irreparable damage done to them in their youth.\u201d",

        "content": "Treatment and transplants for some postponed as hospitals are turned over to treat virus\nSince the coronavirus outbreak hit Italy, Francesca Masi has felt her life has been hanging by a thread. She was diagnosed with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow cancer, in 2016 and was due to have a transplant this month, but now fears it will be postponed as the country deals with the pandemic.\nAccess for thousands of cancer patients in need of chemotherapy, scans, transplants and surgery has become difficult, if not impossible, in Italy\u2019s Covid-19 emergency.\nAcross the country, dozens of specialist cancer wards and hospitals have been transformed to treat coronavirus, while others have closed after medical staff and patients were infected. There are now fewer beds in intensive care units for cancer patients.\n\u201cAt the beginning of my diagnosis I underwent other treatments with success, but since my conditions worsened, transplant became my only option. So to be stuck in this situation make me living in a constant state of anxiety,\u201d says Masi, who lives and works in Pontedera, in the province of Pisa. She is 46 and the mother of a 10-year-old boy. \u201cI now run the risk of dying, which isn\u2019t fair, because my doctors had finally located two foreign donors whose marrow was 100% compatible with mine.\u201d International flight restrictions to halt the spread of\n coronavirus mean marrow from overseas donors risks not arriving in Italy.\nResearch led by Codice Viola, a charity that supports pancreatic cancer patients, and seen exclusively by the Guardian, found that of 500 mostly breast or pancreatic patients appointments for chemotherapy or radiotherapy were postponed for 24% (11% with no arranged date), while 64% of surgical procedures were postponed indefinitely. More than half have had follow-up appointments rescheduled.\nDozens of patients and doctors who spoke to the Guardian fear that the restrictive measures to contain the virus are limiting access to proper medical care for cancer patients, who also represent 17% of Italian coronavirus fatalities, according to a recent study.\nFrancesca Pesce, 54, a professional translator and member of Codice Viola, has been living with metastatic pancreatic cancer for almost three years. This week she will leave Rome for a follow-up in Milan, one of the cities worst affected by the virus.\n\u201cAt least I have this option, which others don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand, cancer patients are afraid of contracting the virus in hospitals, so they forgo their treatments; on the other, hospitals have been forced to cancel their appointments as many oncologists and anaesthetists have been moved to other wards to assist in the Covid-19 emergency.\u201d\nPaolo Ascierto, an oncologist at Naples\u2019 Pascale hospital now treating coronavirus patients, said converting cancer wards to Covid-19 units could be risky. \u201cI understand the state of emergency, but we mustn\u2019t forget that cancer patients require dedicated and specialised treatments. There are special conditions, like patients in follow-up, that can be managed safely using online consultations to monitor the patient\u2019s progress.\n\u201cBut there are other conditions, such as metastatic patients, that must be prioritised, because a lack of constant attention can mean the difference between life and death.\u201d\nIn Ortona, Abruzzo, protests erupted following the announcement by local authorities that the only hospital in the region specialised in women\u2019s cancer treatments was to be entirely converted to treat Covid-19 patients.\nWhere cancer wards are functioning, certain diagnostic procedures, such as endescopies, may be limited, and a decrease in blood donations is limiting surgical options. \u201cAt the moment, only urgent surgical procedures are being performed,\u201d says Pesce. \u201cAnd even urgent procedures are now stymied, because of a shortage of blood due to the coronavirus emergency.\u201d\nThe closure of air routes to and from Italy has also made it virtually impossible for thousands of cancer patients to access treatment in other European hospitals.\nAlessandra Capone, 47, a dancer, feminist and human rights activist, has been living with breast cancer for 10 years. In 2015 it spread to her liver and lymph nodes and last year she began a series of treatments at University Hospital in Frankfurt with just 5% of her liver cancer-free. She is now facing enormous difficulties travelling to Germany.\n\u201cI contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation but the line is always busy and I couldn\u2019t speak to anybody. Then I contacted the Italian consulate in Frankfurt. They told me I need a number of certifications for travelling to another country, even for health reasons. Not to mention that in Germany very few hotels are accepting reservations, especially from Italians, during this emergency. It\u2019s very stressful.\u201d\nFor the first time, however, the Italian government last week authorised an air force flight to Turkey to secure haemopoietic stem cells from a donor for a two-year-old boy whose condition had worsened.\nTravel is also limited within Italy, where patients from Sicily, Puglia and Calabria often undergo treatments and operations in richer Veneto and Lombardy, which are among the worst affected regions in the country for Covid-19.\nGrazia De Michele, 39, a blogger and researcher in the history of medicine, lives in Foggia, in Puglia, and has been living with breast cancer since 2010. A few months ago, her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. \u201cMy mother was supposed to have a CT scan in March to see if the chemo she\u2019s on is working, but the scan was postponed,\u201d she says. \u201cI was supposed to undergo an oophorectomy, and my operation was postponed as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to imagine what it\u2019s like for cancer patients,\u201d says Capone. \u201cMany live in a constant state of anxiety, with the fear of dying. The situation caused by the coronavirus emergency has put them under enormous psychological and physical distress. You see, you can protect yourself from coronavirus by staying at home, but it\u2019s not the same with cancer. Cancer doesn\u2019t follow the diktat of quarantines or decrees. It keeps going, in war and in peace.\u201d",

His supporters will vent but will Rome join his celebrations?\nThis is a mighty triumph not just for George Pell who is breathing free air for the first time in a year, and his backers who invested millions in his defence, but for the narrative of prejudice the church has spun all the years since the Melbourne police came for the cardinal in Rome.\nThe beleaguered church. The misunderstood church. The church under attack by secularists. The church pursued by abuse victims, police and journalists with axes to grind.\nThe unanimity of the court\u2019s decision is crushing for Pell\u2019s prosecutors and, of course, for the young man who brought this complaint to the police nearly five years ago. It has been such a long process for Pell\u2019s accuser to reach this end.\nFrom the start the contest was simple: who was to be believed here, the young man who said he was raped after mass in the sacristy of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral or the church witnesses assembled by Pell\u2019s legal team who claimed it wasn\u2019t possible.\nThe police, the prosecution authorities in Victoria, a jury and two judges of the court of appeal in Melbourne believed the young man. They realised it was hard for Pell to have raped that boy, but it was possible.\nThe high court has said: yes possible, but not reasonably possible.\nTheirs was not a decision made at a lofty level of theory. As has been its practice lately, the high court dug right down into the evidence. The unanimous judgment delivered this morning involves more than a hundred paragraphs of meticulous reconstruction of the rituals of the cathedral, of doors opened and closed, of robes and processions.\nThe judges do not accuse the young man of being a liar or a fantasist. They do not find his evidence contained discrepancies or displayed inadequacies \u201cof such a character as to require the jury to have entertained a doubt as to guilt\u201d.\nBut they have done what the jury and the Victorian court of appeal did not do: they have trusted absolutely the evidence of Pell\u2019s master of ceremonies Monsignor Charles Portelli. This church official said he was with the archbishop at all times that morning, first on the steps of the cathedral farewelling the faithful and then in the sacristy helping him unrobe.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/07-45297-FS_Pell.mp3\nThe high court observed that Portelli\u2019s evidence of having an actual recall of being with Pell on the steps was never challenged by the prosecution. Believe Portelli here and it is hard to believe the man who accuses Pell of rape.\nThe court did what the prosecution argued all the way should not be done: it compounded all the improbabilities to establish doubt.\nRather than adding they multiplied the improbabilities. So the judges concluded that even though they found the young man\u2019s accusations \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d the jury \u201cacting rationally\u201d should have \u201centertained a doubt\u201d as to Pell\u2019s guilt and not put those doubts aside.\n\u201cPlainly they did. Making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility in relation to [the sacristy charges] that an innocent person has been convicted.\u201d\nTolling through their honours\u2019 judgement is the word \u201cunchallenged\u201d. Pell\u2019s acquittal relies almost entirely on the failure of the prosecution to challenge \u2013 let alone destroy \u2013 the evidence of the old cathedral officials and former choir boys in the witness box.\nThe prosecution found gaps but never tore down the fence protecting Pell.\nLong term, the court\u2019s decision reinforces scepticism in senior legal circles about prosecution of accusations of sex crimes committed a long time ago. The question that has yet to be fully explored is how the law operates here when time has placed everyone \u2013 the accused, accusers, police and prosecutors \u2013 at such a disadvantage.\nPell is innocent of these charges. By the ultimate authority we recognise in this country, he was wrongly imprisoned. He has issued a statement offering Christian forgiveness to his tormentors. He can leave it now to his supporters to rage on his behalf. It is going to be a mighty storm. Category Five.\nWhat will be very interesting to watch is whether Rome joins the celebrations.\nFurther work awaits Pell\u2019s lawyers and further bills for his supporters to pay. Victims\u2019 lawyers claim eight civil suits at least are under way to make the church pay for Pell\u2019s alleged failures to protect them from paedophiles.\nAnd as early as today, we will discover, at last, the royal commission\u2019s verdict on the career that took a Ballarat priest who noticed so little about these crimes on his home turf all the way to the highest echelons of the Vatican.",

        "content": "With help from Fox News and Elon Musk, a misleading French study prompted a wave of misinformation that made its way to the president\nThis weekend, Donald Trump used his daily White House coronavirus briefings to again urge Americans to take hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19.\n\u201cWhat do you have to lose? Take it,\u201d the president said on Saturday as he boasted that the US had amassed 29m doses of the drug. On Sunday, facing questions from the press about his aggressive promotion of an unproven treatment, he argued against waiting for the completion of clinical trials. \u201cIn France, they had a very good test,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have time to go and say, \u2018Gee, let\u2019s take a couple of years and test it out, and let\u2019s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.\u2019\u201d\nMeanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease doctor, has repeatedly warned that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug. Asked whether it should be considered a treatment for Covid-19, he said on 24 March: \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d\nThe story of how hydroxychloroquine was anointed the Trump administration\u2019s miracle drug for the coronavirus pandemic is a distinctly modern tale of misinformation within a global information ecosystem beset by widespread uncertainty, fear, media fragmentation and hyper-partisanship. Belief in the drug\u2019s potential to cure patients infected with the virus followed an extraordinary trajectory from a small study conducted in France (Trump\u2019s \u201cvery good test\u201d) to Silicon Valley social media influencers, Fox News and the largest bully pulpit: the White House.\nBut it\u2019s also a story as old as medicine itself. When an epidemic killed thousands in ancient Rome, said Aaron Shakow, a research associate at Harvard Medical School and historian of medicine, the chief physician of the emperor Nero circulated a recipe for an old miracle cure.\n\u201cIt was an attempt by Nero to sustain his legitimacy in the midst of this catastrophic event,\u201d Shakow said. \u201cEpidemics are dangerous to rulers.\u201d\nIn early March, as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated its spread around the globe, a group of scientists in Marseille, France, launched an experiment to see whether hydroxychloroquine, a well-known old malaria drug, could be what everyone was searching for: a cure.\nMost small scientific studies live and die within the rarified domain of academic journals, but the French trial had a much more auspicious debut. Before the study was even published, in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA), a lawyer falsely claiming an affiliation with Stanford University appeared on Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson Tonight to declare the results: a \u201c100% cure rate against coronavirus\u201d. From Fox News, it was only a matter of time (hours, in fact) before the drug was being hailed as a \u201cgame changer\u201d by the president of the United States.\nTrump made his first endorsement of hydroxychloroquine on 19 March. Export controls, shortages, overdoses and scientific recriminations rapidly ensued, but the controversy could not extinguish the power of presidentially endorsed hope. Across the globe and throughout diverse communities on the internet, hydroxychloroquine had been anointed the miracle cure for Covid-19.\nThe only problem? The study that all this fervid hope is based on doesn\u2019t show what its authors claim it does.\nThe gold standard for a clinical trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). What this means in plain English is that the study has been designed to reduce biases that would render its results meaningless. Neither the physician nor the patients knows whether they received the drug (\u201cdouble-blinded\u201d), a safeguard that reduces the possibility that the doctor will treat the two groups differently. The researchers also do not get to choose which patients go into which group (\u201crandomized\u201d) and the makeup of the two groups is roughly equivalent (\u201ccontrolled\u201d).\nThe French hydroxychloroquine study did not follow any of these rules.\nThe treatment group and the control group were drawn from separate populations: the treatment group were all patients at the institution where the researchers worked, the M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille, while the control patients came from other hospitals in the south of France. The treatment group (mean age 51.2) was significantly older than the control group (mean age 37.3), introducing another variable that could undermine the meaning of the results. The study was \u201copen label\u201d, meaning the physicians and patients knew which treatment they were receiving. The French researchers also treated some but not all of the treatment group patients with azithromycin, a common antibiotic, another complicating factor that was not randomized.\nBut even more important than these shortcomings in the design of the study is how the researchers chose to measure and report their results. Forty-two patients were initially included in the study. Three were transferred to the intensive care unit; one died, one left the hospital, and one stopped taking the treatment due to nausea. The other 36 eventually recovered, and those who received the drug cleared the virus from the system faster than those who did not.\nIf you had only heard about this study from the Fox News assertion of a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d, you might assume that the four patients with poor clinical outcomes (the three ICU visits and one death) had been unlucky enough to be in the group that did not receive the \u201ccure\u201d.\nAnd yet, those four patients, as well as the patient with nausea and the one who left the hospital early, were all part of the treatment group. They were excluded from the topline results of the study because of the way that the researchers chose to measure and report the results: strictly based on the measurable presence of viruses in nasal swabs taken each day of the study. Since the patients were in the ICU or dead, their samples could not be taken and they were left out of the final analysis. Based on the nasal swabs of just the 36 patients who completed the study, those who received the drug cleared the virus from their systems faster than those who did not.\nThis is how an experiment in which 15% of the treatment group and 0% of the control had poor clinical outcomes could end up being reported as showing a \u201c100% cure rate\u201d.\nOn 3 April, two weeks after the study was first published online, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the IJAA, said in a statement that the group\u2019s board \u201cbelieves the article does not meet the Society\u2019s expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety\u201d.\nDidier Raoult, the corresponding author for the French study, did not respond to questions from the Guardian.\nAndrew Noymer, a professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, described the results of the French study as \u201cmeaningless\u201d. \u201cThey should have done an RCT,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis idea that we\u2019re all manning the lifeboats and there\u2019s no time for that is just absurd,\u201d Noymer added. \u201cThey could have already done it. They could have had the answer by now \u2026 Doctors have always gone with their guts and saved many lives, but I don\u2019t know. If they had done RCTs on Thalidomide\u201d \u2013 a drug that caused birth defects \u2013 \u201cthey would have figured out its dangers a lot sooner.\u201d\nSo how did one interesting but flawed study out of the south of France make its way to Fox News\u2019s prime time and the White House?\nIt was not surprising that scientists were interested in testing hydroxychloroquine (and its close relative, chloroquine), a well-known and understood drug, as a potential treatment against Covid-19. It is one of a number of possible treatments that scientists in China and South Korea looked at in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, including in vitro (ie lab-based) experiments that showed promising (though not conclusive) results. The drug was also selected as one of four that the World Health Organization included in its large-scale international clinical trial.\nBut while hydroxychloroquine was garnering some interest in the early days of the pandemic, other possible treatments, such as Gilead\u2019s antiviral Remdesivir, were drawing more. Google trends data shows that people were searching for Remdesivir more than hydroxychloroquine throughout most of February.\nWhat Remdesivir lacked that hydroxychloroquine had, however, was a team of dedicated hype men who appeared more interested in publicizing the drug as a cure than they were in discovering whether the drug was effective.\nAmong these is Raoult, the French physician who co-authored the hydroxychloroquine study in Marseille. Before Raoult had even begun his clinical trial, in late February, he appeared in the press to promote the idea of chloroquine as a treatment, researchers with First Draft News found. A video of the appearance received more than a quarter-million views on Facebook.\nRaoult also found a dedicated and effective English-language publicist in Gregory Rigano, the lawyer who appeared on Fox News with a chyron that falsely labeled him an \u201cadviser\u201d to Stanford medical school. Rigano wrote a Google document promoting the use of chloroquine with James Todaro, a blockchain investor who received a medical degree from Columbia University but does not appear to practice. (The document initially listed a third co-author, a retired biochemist who disclaimed any knowledge of it when contacted by Wired.)\nThe Google document, which was formatted in a way that made it appear to be a scientific paper, found an audience among Silicon Valley\u2019s elite. It was shared on Twitter by a number of influential investors before it hit the virality motherlode: on 16 March, the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted the link to the document to his nearly 33 million followers.\nMaybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr\n\u201cWhen someone who is newsworthy or notable that has an enormous network on social media tweets about something that could be as path-breaking as a medicine that could treat coronavirus, everyone is going to pay attention no matter if that person has expertise or not,\u201d said Joan Donovan, director of the technology and social change research project at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center. \u201cElon Musk elevating and giving voice to this Google doc does act as a validating mechanism. Elon Musk is a tech entrepreneur best known as a car salesman, but nevertheless people look to him for what\u2019s new, what\u2019s next.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s tweet received more than 13,000 retweets. (He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about his promotion of the document.) Search interest in chloroquine soared. Mainstream media outlets covered his apparent endorsement of the drug. An 85-year-old medication was well on its way to becoming a Covid-19 meme.\nOnce Trump declared himself a proponent of hydroxychloroquine, the scientific debate over the drug was drowned out by a decidedly partisan one.\nRightwing media outlets have followed Fox News\u2019s lead (an analysis by Media Matters found that the cable news channel promoted using the drug 109 times between 23 and 25 March) to become staunch proponents of the drug, from digital outrage factories such as the Daily Caller and the Daily Wire to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cThese drugs are helping our coronavirus patients,\u201d declared the headline of the Journal op-ed, which was written by two physicians from Kansas, Jeff Colyer and Daniel Hinthorn. The pair wrote that they had been treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and encouraged others to do so too \u201cas a matter of clinical practice\u201d once a patient tests positive. They also recommended using the drug prophylactically for healthcare workers.\nThe doctors did not provide any data from their own patients, but referenced the French study, writing: \u201cResearchers in France treated a small number of patients with both hydroxychloroquine and a Z-Pak, and 100% of them were cured by day six of treatment.\u201d\nHinthorn, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Kansas medical center, responded to queries from the Guardian about the op-ed\u2019s mischaracterization of the French study: \u201cYou are correct. Any patient left out of any analysis makes us suspicious. But what this study told us was that this was a combination that might merit further evaluation.\u201d\nHe acknowledged that it is unknown whether the drug is beneficial or harmful for Covid-19 patients, but said that since no drug has as yet been proven effective, \u201cif there is any medication that might give hope, we prefer to try it\u201d as long as it is safe. \u201cWe should know in the next few weeks whether such a regimen was a wise decision or not.\u201d\nHinthorn did not respond to a follow-up question about whether the op-ed should be corrected to more accurately reflect the degree of uncertainty around hydroxychloroquine. Colyer, the former governor of Kansas and a plastic surgeon, did not respond to requests for comment. He has since written a second op-ed for the Journal, also promoting hydroxychloroquine.\nThe idea that hydroxychloroquine is \u201cthe cure\u201d has taken off within certain online communities, including among anti-vaxxers and followers of QAnon, a rightwing conspiracy theory. The drug has also found support from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a small, ultra-conservative organization that advocates against government involvement in medicine. The group launched a texting campaign to bombard physicians with demands to sign a petition against \u201cred tape\u201d that might prevent them from prescribing the drug, Reuters reported.\nAway from the rancor of the partisan media, scientists and physicians continue to study the effects of the drug. In some states, including the hard-hit New York, hospitals are following Hinthorn\u2019s rationale and using the drug since no proven therapy exists.\nA group of French researchers published a refutation of the Raoult study in M\u00e9decine et Maladies Infectieuses on 30 March. The researchers, at Saint Louis hospital in France, followed the same regimen of hydroxychloroquine for 11 patients, and did not have similar results. \u201cWe found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOngoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety.\u201d\nBut another study \u2013 this time a randomized controlled trial \u2013 out of Wuhan, China, has sparked hope since it was circulated ahead of publication on 31 March. The trial of 62 patients found that patients with mild cases of Covid-19 who were treated with hydroxychloroquine recovered faster than those who did not \u2013 and none of them progressed to \u201csevere\u201d illness. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.\nThe authors of the study urged further research and large-scale clinical trials to better understand how the drug operates and how best to use it.\nThe hype around hydroxychloroquine has not been without casualties.\nHeightened demand for the drug has left longtime patients \u2013 including lupus patients who have long used it as an anti-inflammatory \u2013 forced to go without. Overdoses have also been reported in the US and Nigeria as frightened individuals attempt to self-medicate.\nSocial media companies, who have been proactive about policing misinformation about coronavirus, have taken some steps to counter the spread of false claims. Google took down the Google document by Rigano , though the company has not responded to numerous requests for an explanation. Twitter has also deleted tweets by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and the Fox News personality Laura Ingraham that touted the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.\nBut it\u2019s hard to see how these small enforcement actions by internet platforms can have much of an impact when the president of the United States continues to use his platform to promote the drug, as he did during his daily briefings on Saturday and again on Sunday.\nTrump\u2019s promotion of the drug has raised questions about his motivation, and on Monday the New York Times reported that the president holds \u201ca small personal financial interest\u201d in Sanofi, the company that makes a brandname version of hydroxychloroquine. (The drug\u2019s patent has expired so other pharmaceutical companies can manufacture generic versions.)\nAs a piece of viral misinformation, the hydroxychloroquine meme has amassed an extraordinary list of validators, starting with its placement in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. (Though misinformation stemming from academia is not without precedent; the paper that touched off the false belief in a link between autism and the measles vaccine was published in one of the most respected publications in medicine, and only retracted 12 years later.) It\u2019s also very difficult to refute, because none of the hydroxychloroquine narrative\u2019s critics can or will say anything definitive about its efficacy. Uncertainty and a call to await further study is a weak sword to bring to a fight against an overly confident propagandist.\nTrump\u2019s unscientific embrace of hydroxychloroquine is not common, but there are historical examples of heads of state spreading misinformation during pandemics. One recent, tragic example is the HIV-denialism of the South African president Thabo Mbeki, who rejected the use of antiretroviral drugs for his country\u2019s citizens and instead promoted nutritional remedies such as beetroot juice and garlic. Researchers at the Harvard school of public health ultimately placed the death toll of Mbeki\u2019s policies at approximately 330,000.\nNoymer, the UC Irvine epidemiologist, said that the two situations were not quite analogous, since hydroxychloroquine has a \u201cplausible mechanism\u201d to combat the coronavirus, while beetroot juice never did.\nStill, Noymer said that the influence that a president can have over a population\u2019s attitude toward a medicine or drug is significant. He recalled President Gerald Ford publicly receiving a flu shot in 1976, amid fear that a new swine flu could lead to a pandemic.\n\u201cThere was a photograph of him rolling up a sleeve and getting a shot, and the uptake on the flu shot was enormous,\u201d Noymer said. \u201cWhen the president of the United States does something, it\u2019s quite the endorsement.\u201d\nAs for Trump, it does not appear likely that he will stop hyping the drug anytime soon, nor that he will take responsibility if anything goes wrong.\n\u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cThey say, take it. I\u2019m not looking at it one way or the other \u2026 If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn\u2019t do it early. I\u2019ve seen things that I sort of like, so what do I know?\n\u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d",

        "content": "Perfect storm of conditions helped nonsense theories about 5G and coronavirus to take hold\nA year ago, hoax theories about the dangers of 5G had barely pierced the public\u2019s consciousness, largely remaining confined to serious conspiracy theorists such as David Icke.\nIn recent weeks, baseless claims about risks associated with the next-generation mobile technology have gone mainstream. Claims linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic have led to petrol bomb attacks on phone masts and rebuttals from the government.\nIndustry insiders and factchecking experts point to a perfect storm of conditions that have helped the theory \u2013 described as \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d \u2013 to take hold.\nThey cite the rapid growth of neighbourhood social media groups, a failure by networks to promote scientific evidence about 5G, and a terrified population looking to make sense of a world turned upside down.\nThe government and mobile networks have been left scrambling as the some members of the public have turned on telecoms engineers and carried out arson attacks on masts that in many cases do not yet have 5G equipment, as the rollout has been so slow.\nTom Phillips, the editor of the factchecking organisation Full Fact, said it warned last summer about the growing prevalence of 5G health claims. But in recent weeks debunked claims about 5G had been transformed, potentially aided by the creation of new local Facebook and WhatsApp groups to help support neighbours during the pandemic. Google Trends data suggests British interest in 5G theories exploded in the final days of March, shortly after the lockdown was imposed.\nPhillips said one of the difficulties in battling the various claims was that it is hard to pin down exactly what is being suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen theories that the virus is real but 5G is making it worse, we\u2019ve seen theories that the symptoms are not the result of the virus but purely the result of 5G, and we\u2019ve seen theories that there are no outbreaks at all but it\u2019s all a hoax to cover up the installation of 5G,\u201d he said.\nA senior member of staff at one UK mobile network blamed the rapid spread of a map that purported to show an overlap between countries that had coronavirus cases and countries that had rolled out 5G. The map was not accurate on either measure.\nOther viral claims emphasised other supposed coincidences. A popular claim that Wuhan was the first city in the world to receive 5G took hold. But Wuhan received 5G coverage in August 2019, almost 18 months after O2 launched its first London testbed for the technology on the Greenwich peninsula. Iran, meanwhile, has seen an incredibly high number of coronavirus cases despite not having any 5G coverage.\nThe International Commission on Non\u2010Ionizing Radiation Protection, which sets guidelines on the output of mobile masts, says there is not a single scientifically substantiated adverse health effect that can be attributed to a normal 5G installation.\n\u201cWe know parts of the community are concerned about the safety of 5G,\u201d Dr Eric van Rongen, the chair of the ICNIRP, told the Guardian. \u201cThe guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process.\u201d\nAs social media interest in the topic grew, some less scrupulous news outlets latched on to it as a potential source of clicks. The press regulation campaign group Hacked Off has noted that the Daily Star published an article on 24 March \u2013 the day after Boris Johnson ordered Britons to stay inside \u2013 with the headline \u201cCoronavirus: Fears 5G wifi networks could be acting as \u2018accelerator\u2019 for disease\u201d. The story, labelled as an exclusive, relied entirely on quotes from non-scientists.\nCelebrities who often have larger audiences on Twitter and Instagram than many mainstream news outlets also boosted the theory, although some have since backed down. After the Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge Amanda Holden was mocked for tweeting a link to a petition about the theory, her representative told media outlets that she had accidentally shared the link and did not endorse conspiracy theories.\nFacing pressure from the government and a showdown with ministers, Facebook announced on Monday that it would start to actively remove false claims that linked Covid-19 to 5G and could lead to physical harm. However, its policy on other scientifically unjustified claims about 5G remain unclear.\nUsers on one of the biggest anti-5G Facebook groups in the UK mix pictures of apparently burnt-out mobile phone equipment with anti-vaccine material and baseless claims that coronavirus wards on hospitals are empty.\nOne prominent anti-5G group in Bristol defended itself from critics by adopting the language of those who distrust mainstream media and scientific voices, claiming that rejecting authoritative voices was the only way to find what is really going on.\nDirect action in the UK against telephone masts is nothing new. When 3G equipment was being installed across the country in the mid-2000s there was similar outbreaks of concern about supposed health risks, with some resorting to direct action.\nA long-running protest campaign against a mobile phone mast in the North Yorkshire village of Sheriff Hutton, partly on health grounds, culminated in a mysterious incident in 2007 in which concrete was poured into the base station.\nSimilar claims have been made for decades about the impact of microwave ovens and home wifi connections.\nYet despite warnings that public fears about 5G were growing before the pandemic, networks did little large-scale outreach work to counter the concerns. \u201cI think as an industry we could have been quicker and clearer about what 5G is,\u201d one network insider said. \u201cAs in, it\u2019s basically the same as 4G in terms of how it uses mobile spectrum. We tend to get a bit bogged down on the technology and miss the wider picture.\u201d\nTom Phillips, the factchecking journalist, said it was always tough to convince people to change their minds on such topics once they had decided a theory was true. He also said people who believed the theories needed to be treated with compassion.\n\u201cIt is not enough to try and stamp out the poor quality information, you do have to put good information in its place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as soon you try to provide information, you run the risk of becoming part of the conspiracy theory \u2013 \u2018you would say that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019\u201d",

        "content": "In the midst of fear and isolation, we are learning that profound, positive change is possible\nDisasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible \u2013 extending workers\u2019 rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US \u2013 have already happened.\nThe word \u201ccrisis\u201d means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word \u201cemergency\u201d comes from \u201cemergence\u201d or \u201cemerge\u201d, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word \u201ccatastrophe\u201d comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.\nWe have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now \u2013 especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties \u2013 is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.\nA disaster (which originally meant \u201cill-starred\u201d, or \u201cunder a bad star\u201d) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of \u201cwe\u201d might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.\nAs the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you\u2019re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you\u2019re working all the time, especially when it appears you\u2019re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.\nThe first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems \u2013 political, economic, social, ecological \u2013 in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what\u2019s strong, what\u2019s weak, what\u2019s corrupt, what matters and what doesn\u2019t.\nI often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it\u2019s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo \u2013 it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it\u2019s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.\nThose who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life \u2013 as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power \u2013 as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights \u2013 and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).\nDisaster scholars use the term \u201celite panic\u201d to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201clooting\u201d in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it\u2019s wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it\u2019s altruistic to gather supplies to share.\nSuch elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a \u201cshoot to kill\u201d proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans\u2019s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.\nThe mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 levees had failed; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush\u2019s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil\u2019s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: \u201cHe represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn\u2019t care less about people\u2019s lives. They\u2019re worried about maintaining their profitability.\u201d (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)\nThe billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed divine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: \u201cplease do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms & your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.\u201d The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: \u201cThe damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.\u201d (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)\nHistorically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.\nThe idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them \u2013 this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one\u2019s whims. \u201cThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.\nOur rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US \u2013 a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.\nWhen a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.\nFor many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: \u201cLet us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.\u201d We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.\nMy friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: \u201cWe are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.\u201d\nWhen we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.\nAlthough staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff \u2013 medicine, medical equipment \u2013 made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.\n\u201cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\u201d Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all \u2013 and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.\nA dozen years ago I interviewed the Nicaraguan poet and Sandinista revolutionary Gioconda Belli for my book on disaster, A Paradise Built in Hell. What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua \u2013 that, despite the dictatorship\u2019s crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution \u2013 was unforgettable. She said: \u201cYou had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: \u2018So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.\u2019 You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It\u2019s a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.\u201d\nI have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.\nI have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe\u2019s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible \u2013 housing the homeless, for example \u2013 have come to pass in some places.\nIreland nationalised its hospitals, something \u201cwe were told would never happen and could never happen,\u201d an Irish journalist commented. Canada came up with four months of basic income for those who lost their jobs. Germany did more than that. Portugal decided to treat immigrants and asylum seekers as full citizens during the pandemic. In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is \u201cfollowing guidelines\u201d on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost half a million Kroger grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general told Amazon to expand its paid sick leave. These specifics make clear how possible it is to change the financial arrangements of all our societies.\nBut often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011\u2019s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.\nWe are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There\u2019s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.\nThere\u2019s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it\u2019s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells \u2013 for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It\u2019s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid \u2013 full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.\nBut this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one\u2019s own interior life and the suffering around us \u2013 and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed \u2013 well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.\nSeven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: \u201cProvide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.\u201d It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.\nHope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

UK charities have estimated they face a \u00a34bn shortfall over three months, with organisations including Cancer Research UK, Barnardo\u2019s and the Children\u2019s Society all warning of significant drops in income.\nSue Ryder has lost \u00a32m from its investment fund and \u00a3440,000 in monthly retail profits while it is still paying rents on many of its units.\nThe cancellation of the London Marathon, which was due to happen on 26 April, cost it \u00a3200,000 in lost fundraising and in total it is facing a \u00a312m shortfall in the next three months. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the charity was facing financial strains with the proportion of its income from the NHS falling from about 55% in 2012 to 30%.\n\u201cTo close at this time would be crazy,\u201d said Heidi Travis, chief executive of Sue Ryder. \u201cWe know we ought to be taking patients from NHS trusts. [The people we look after] would have to go back to the NHS, including the hundreds of people being cared for in the community. At this time it would be ridiculous.\u201d\nAlongside Marie Curie, the other major provider of hospice care, Hospice Care UK and Together for Short Lives, a children\u2019s charity, Sue Ryder has been calling for a \u00a3200m rescue package from the Department of Health and Social Care to see the hospice sector through the next three months.\nOn Sunday, Matt Hancock said he is putting more money into hospices. The health secretary also proposed that Premier League footballers \u201cclub together and support our hospices and support the national effort that we\u2019re all in\u201d.\nBut with no announcement on funding yet made, Sue Ryder has now launched a public appeal for funds.\n\u201cThe country will lose its hospices at a time when they are needed most,\u201d said Travis. \u201cThis is a plea and no less, we cannot wait any longer. Our doctors and nurses are working night and day to provide end of life care to more people, now and in the coming weeks, than ever before. We are a critical frontline support service in the fight against coronavirus yet we are on the brink of closure.\u201d\nCarrie-Anne Taitt, 30, a mother of two with incurable cancer receiving care at home in Gloucestershire from Sue Ryder, said the prospect of the charity closing services was \u201chugely scary\u201d.\n\u201cThe government needs to step in and make sure we are protected and we don\u2019t end up getting more poorly and putting more strain on the NHS,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise it is a vicious circle.\u201d\nShe said that the home carers provided by the charity had become \u201ca huge part of my life\u201d, especially now that her children, aged three and six, are not able to go out to school or child care.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t come, it would be a major stress,\u201d she said. \u201cWe desperately, desperately need them.\u201dA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cPalliative and end of life care services, including hospices, play a hugely important role in providing care for thousands at the most difficult time, and last year the prime minister announced a \u00a325m cash injection to protect the crucial service they provide.\n\u201cWe are absolutely committed to keeping hospices open during this time and are working closely with the NHS, Together for Short Lives and Hospice UK on an appropriate national response. We will be setting out our hospice support package shortly.\u201d",

Just a bank of television cameras waiting for no one to emerge.\nThe final act in this most scrutinised, most divisive criminal case was playing out inside. Just 12 people heard the decision of Australia\u2019s highest court, to free Australia\u2019s most prominent Catholic and quash historic child sexual assault convictions.\nThe chief justice, Susan Kiefel, took less than a minute to read the court\u2019s unanimous orders to an almost empty high court registry. Physical distancing rules meant only three journalists and two lawyers were allowed to sit inside.\nAnother small group stood near the open door to hear Kiefel dispassionately order \u201cthe appellant\u2019s convictions be quashed and judgments of acquittal be entered in their place\u201d.\nAnd that was that. No emotional outbursts, gasps or screams. Just a handful of observers, looking at one another and trying to comprehend how unremarkable and utterly remarkable that moment had been. National history, delivered like an announcement to a doctor\u2019s waiting room.\nThroughout Pell\u2019s trial and appeals, crowds have gathered inside courtrooms and on the steps outside. At critical moments, journalists and observers have had to line up for hours to find a seat inside. When Pell first appeared in Melbourne magistrates court in 2017, he was escorted through the crowds by more than a dozen Victoria police officers.\nA handful of journalists, including my colleague Melissa Davey, have followed the case against Pell from its first moments to today, his final avenue for appeal. He was tried twice \u2013 first a mistrial and then a retrial \u2013 before being convicted in late 2018.\nCoronavirus restrictions made it impossible for any of those journalists to attend the final climactic minute; Kiefel had been working from her office in Queensland, and the state\u2019s borders are now closed to most interstate visitors.\nThe court had made arrangements to ensure the physical delivery of the judgment to a near-empty courtroom did not delay scrutiny of the decision. The judgment was posted online, and the high court website was promptly overwhelmed with traffic.\nAt 10.11am, the court announced the decision on Twitter.\nJudgment has been delivered in Pell v The Queen https://t.co/TzjVX0RLXh\nTo those waiting anxiously in the rest of Australia \u2013 from Barwon prison to the suburbs of Ballarat \u2013 those few minutes after 10am might have seemed like transmission being cut during the final crucial play of a football grand final.\nFor those who were there, it was unclear what to do next. News crews gathered outside the courthouse, as they typically do at the conclusion of a case, waiting for the various parties to emerge.\nBut no one was there. No protesters. No lawyers. No one to remark on one of the most significant legal judgments in Australia\u2019s history.",

        "content": "A new era needs to value teachers and end the tyranny of tests and ruthless competition for league table places\nFrom goodness knows where, in the last few weeks school and college leaders have pulled out all the stops. Despite 10 years of real-term funding cuts and ongoing fears of redundancies, the education profession has risen to the Covid-19 challenge.\nFrom nursery schools to further education colleges, colleagues have entrenched themselves in their communities, caring for the children of key workers and those at risk of harm while becoming distributors of food and providers of essential social care services.\nHundreds of thousands of teachers and support staff are busy at home trying to provide a support system for parents and a semblance of routine for children and young people. Many are reassuring those who would, in England, have been taking GCSEs and A-levels, or providing online learning resources and marking coursework for students of applied qualifications.\nHowever, decisions and support from the Department for Education have been slow, reactionary, and leaked to the press rather than first shared with the profession. They have not been collaborative. School and college leaders, local authorities and trade unions have filled the gaping hole vacated by central government.\nOne thing is clear, when this is over, society will be fundamentally changed. Children and their families, our school and college communities, will need considerable support to deal with illness and bereavement, changes in employment and housing situations.\nNo adult or child will be untouched. When we come out of social distancing and isolation, children and young people and their families will need help to manage mental health, self-esteem, friendships and relationships.\nEducation will need to change, too. We cannot simply return to the status quo. A third of teachers are actively thinking of leaving the profession within the next five years; there is a teacher and school leader recruitment crisis. Education support staff roles have been cut to the bone and teaching assistants, supporting the children with the most complex special needs, are being paid insultingly low wages that do not reflect their importance.\nCancelling Sats tests and public exams was the right decision. However, it is not only the 2019-20 cohort who will be affected by this crisis. The education, physical and mental health of a generation is at stake. Children of NHS and other key and essential workers will see their parents exhausted and exposed to the biggest health risk in a hundred years.\nWhen we go back to school everything will be different \u2013 and it must be different. We need to ask ourselves the fundamental question: what is the purpose of education?\nWhen the time is right we, the profession, the experts, must start formulating the answer. We must be ready to enter a new reality of an education system that values the professional judgment of teachers and leaders.\nWe cannot continue to have a system that has nearly 3,000 children with special educational needs and disabilities lacking a permanent school place. We cannot continue to have an exam system that leaves a third of pupils labelled as failures.\nThe use of education as an ideological and political football that fails the most vulnerable must end. We cannot continue with a toxic exam system that is based on rote learning and an out-of-date curriculum chosen by whoever happens to be the education secretary, and an exam system that has been responsible for a dramatic rise in child and adolescent mental health illness.\nWe have got to stop the testing hamster wheel that burns out children. We cannot continue to allow 16-year-olds to sit 33 hours of GCSE exams, when education and training continues to age 18 and beyond.\nWe must end the fixation with A-levels as the \u201cgold standard\u201d, just because they\u2019ve been around a long time. Our education system must recognise the achievements of all and must not continue to label those who take a vocational education route as less worthy or less valuable, or their qualifications less rigorous.\nWe must end the education \u201cmarket\u201d and the game playing, end the practice of schools competing against each other for pupils, results and league table places.\nWe cannot and will not continue to be terrorised by Ofsted, an overbearing accountability system that ends the careers of school leaders and teachers, discourages professional collaboration, drives up stress levels and disadvantages those working in the most deprived areas.\nThis pandemic is going to hurt those most at risk: those in precarious employment, those in rented accommodation and all those who, just weeks ago, the government labelled as unskilled \u2013 the essential workers in schools, shops, hospitality, social care, delivery and communications, cleaners, caretakers, the armed forces, police, fire, ambulance and the NHS.\nIf we don\u2019t recognise now the vital importance of an inclusive education system and the positive impact it can have on developing a fairer society, then, I fear, we never will. We must use the situation we are faced with now to end child poverty and inequalities in education and the wider society.\nNiamh Sweeney is a teacher of health and social care and criminology at Cambridge Sixth Form College",

A year on from the ugly scenes outside the school gate, his hands no longer tremble, there have been no recent death threats, and he doesn\u2019t have to call home when he arrives at work each morning.\nHe\u2019s just published his second book, No Outsiders: Everyone Different, Everyone Welcome, a new version of his award-winning lessons on equality, No Outsiders.\nAs a result of his experience at Parkfield a year ago, where activists and parents protested against lessons at the school, wrongly claiming they were part of the government\u2019s plans for relationships and sex education, and hundreds of children were withdrawn from school by their parents, Moffat has made one significant change to his second book. Now he no longer calls on everyone to \u201ccelebrate\u201d LGBT people. Instead, he wants the community to accept that there are different sexual orientations and that LGBT+ people exist.\nThe change is likely to face \u201ca roar of disapproval from defenders of LGBT equality\u201d, he acknowledges.\nHe has also moved to a new job, leaving his post as Parkfield\u2019s assistant head responsible for personal development for a wider role of personal development lead for the whole of the Excelsior trust, to which the school belongs.\nLooking back at the protests, Moffat thinks the word \u201ccelebrate\u201d might have been a sticking point for some Muslim parents.\n\u201cI am very happy to be gay myself and I\u2019m celebrating that, but I don\u2019t expect you to celebrate my sexual orientation with me,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, I do expect it to be accepted without judgment in the same way I will accept those parts of you that may be different to me.\u201d\nHe hopes the \u201crealistic\u201d change in terminology will address the concerns of some faith groups, although he realises others might see the change as a climbdown.\nAlmost all \u2013 98% \u2013 of children at Parkfield community school are Muslim, and many of their parents joined the noisy protests, orchestrated by outside activists, against the government\u2019s plans to introduce relationships and sex education from September 2020. The protesters alleged Parkfield was already teaching four- and five-year-olds about gay sex, and even said teachers were using clay models to demonstrate LGBT \u201csexual mechanics\u201d to infant classes.\nIn fact, LGBT+ equality is only a small part of No Outsiders, the equalities programme Moffat had pioneered at the 770-pupil school, where 23 nationalities are represented. The scheme included welcoming people of any race, colour or religion and those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, and introducing young children to the idea that there are many different types of families, including ones with two mummies or daddies.\nUnder the programme, older children read books showing that love can grow between many kinds of people, including those of the same sex.\nThe school said its teaching was in line with the Equalities Act 2010, and Ofsted approved it as \u201cage appropriate\u201d and \u201caccepted by most parents\u201d. Moffat was one of 10 teachers worldwide shortlisted for a $1m global teaching award as a result of the success of his scheme.\nIn his new role Moffat is busier than ever, training other schools to use the scheme. His second book shows how people who are very different, from eye and hair colour to disabilities, race and sexual orientation, can get on well together and should not be made to feel outsiders.\nHe has updated and changed some of the recommended resources, including a wider range of cultures and nationalities, and is publishing a film on YouTube of a No Outsiders public speaking competition at a Cheshire academies trust, in which children explain what made them feel left out.\nHe insists that the change in terminology, from \u201ccelebrate\u201d to \u201caccept\u201d is not a climbdown. \u201cThe last six months have been a huge learning curve and sometimes the right thing to do is step back and listen and reflect. I am not always right. Sometimes there is no right or wrong response; there\u2019s just a response and the \u2018right or wrong\u2019 depends on the listeners experience and understanding.\n\u201cThe challenge is to work with the response to find common ground while bringing people with me,\u201d he says.\nInterestingly, it was a Church of England vicar, who wrote to Moffat praising the No Outsiders programme who prompted the re-think.\n\u201cHe asked me to consider that for some people of faith, while \u2018tolerating\u2019 LGBT was realistic, \u2018celebrating\u2019 was not. This stuck in my throat. My initial response was to accuse him of being homophobic and of asking me to accept his homophobia.\n\u201cBut, on reflection, I realised all he was asking for was to be allowed to tolerate rather than celebrate. Is that an unreasonable request? I may get a backlash from the LGBT community, but I think I am being realistic. To say \u2018I know you are Muslim, gay, black\u2019 is not inviting people to make any judgment. They just need to know.\u201d\nThis time last year he had feared No Outsiders was under threat, but other schools continued to use it.\n\u201cLooking back, we all felt isolated and vulnerable. I was frightened all the time. I\u2019d built up a good relationship with the children over four years and it was crumbling; children were walking away from me, they would walk out of my assemblies. I would say good morning to them and they wouldn\u2019t answer,\u201d Moffat says.\n\u201cWhat do you do when children get up and leave an assembly. Do you put a bouncer on the door? What if they all get up? We decided I wouldn\u2019t do assemblies for a while, which you could argue was a climbdown, but it is about managing a school and avoiding confrontation.\u201d\nThe demonstrations stopped last autumn after a judge upheld a ban on protests outside another Birmingham primary. Now Moffat is enjoying his new role at the Excelsior trust, and already this year has visited 12 schools to train them and delivered 16 conference speeches and workshops, plus teacher training at universities.\nWas he forced out of Parkfield? \u201cNot at all. I took up the post in January this year and was at Parkfield a term before that. Reports last year that we had stopped the lessons and assemblies were wrong.\n\u201cWe tweaked the age at which one book was used and substituted one for another to show we were listening, but we did not give way.\u201d\nHe continues to take assemblies at Parkfield and conducts regular workshops for parents to explain what the children are learning.\nBefore he joined Parkfield, Moffat had left his previous primary school after Christian parents complained that he had come out as gay. \u201cWhen I came to Parkfield I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to get it wrong again,\u201d he says.\nSo did he get it wrong again? \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I did because it worked for four years. But as much as I say I wasn\u2019t wrong, I can\u2019t just absolve responsibility. You can\u2019t just wave a flag; you have to deal with the perception and try to bridge that gap.\n\u201cI do think, though, that perhaps I underestimated the potential influence of groups outside the parent community at my school and their ability to upset the understanding of our equality work.\u201d\nAnd the protests have given his equality teaching a much bigger profile. Now his hope is for a generation of better informed and kinder young people who accept differences in society \u2013 even if they don\u2019t always celebrate them.",

The move has already seen more than a million Bangladeshi garment workers lose their jobs or be sent home without pay.\nPrimark has announced that it will create a fund to help pay the wages of workers linked to orders that were due for shipment in the month after they were cancelled in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.\nHowever, the brand also stipulated that the wage compensation would be adjusted to take into account government support packages, a caveat that has caused confusion among suppliers and industry bodies.\n\u201cWhile we welcome Primark\u2019s announcement that they will compensate workers for the wages they will lose as a result of these cancelled orders, it is not clear enough what they mean,\u201d says Rubana Huq, chairperson of the BGMEA. \u201cWage compensation should not take government loans into consideration. These brands have existing business commitments with their suppliers that are their responsibility to honour.\u201d\nFactory owners in Bangladesh also asked for further clarity about whether Primark would agree to pay invoices for any of the completed orders it has cancelled or for any of the raw materials already purchased by suppliers.\nDue to the Covid-19 epidemic, all of Primark\u2019s retail outlets have closed, with monthly losses estimated at \u00a3650m. Primark chief executive Paul Marchant said that the company already has \u00a31.6bn of paid-for stock in stores that it currently cannot sell.\n\u201cEvery one of our stores around the world is closed. With a backlog of stock in stores, depots and in transit, we have had to make the very difficult decision to cancel orders for future stock,\u201d he says.\n\u201cFinding a way to ensure that workers in our supply chain in these countries are paid has been a priority over the past two weeks and we are pleased that this fund will provide relief to these workers.\u201d",

        "content": "Infectious diseases experts urge caution amid concerns about anti-malarial\u2019s possible side-effects\nA controversial anti-malaria drug will be given to Australian Covid-19 patients in hospitals outside of clinical trials, the federal government confirmed, after the therapeutic goods registration requirements for two drugs were waived to allow them to be imported to and stockpiled in Australia.\nThe drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, are being explored in clinical trials around the world for their potential as a coronavirus treatment to ease symptoms, or as a preventative drug to stop people being overcome with the infection. Trials are exploring use of the drugs on their own as well as in combination with others.\nBut clinicians have warned that hydroxychloroquine can cause severe and even life-threatening side-effects, and have cautioned against using it for conditions for which it has not been tested. It is a proven treatment for malaria and for some autoimmune conditions.\nStudies on its efficacy as a Covid-19 preventative or treatment are mixed. Much of the focus on the drug came after a small French study, which has since been widely disputed and been found to have omitted data contain spurious results. A small study from China found no benefit to chloroquine being given to Covid-19 patients.\nHydroxychloroquine has also caused division within the White House, Axios reported, after the US president, Donald Trump, hyped it as a \u201cgame changer\u201d in treating the virus. The White House infectious disease expert warned Trump that evidence for the drug was only anecdotal and far from proven.\nA health department spokesman said the inclusion of the medicine in the national medical stockpile was based on not only its proven clinical uses, but on its potential clinical utility in the absence of a well-documented treatment.\nWhile \u201cclinical trials are critical for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of potential treatments, before they are made available through the health system\u201d, the spokesman said, the drug would be made available not only for clinical trials but \u201cfor use in hospitals for ill patients\u201d.\nThe government said under an emergency exemption to therapeutic goods registration requirements the drug would be sourced from overseas and imported, including intermediates and other raw materials so that local manufacturing could occur.\nThe department confirmed that the former federal politician Clive Palmer, who has said he will produce 1m doses of the drug, has a prior written arrangement with the commonwealth and so his plan aligned with the emergency exemption.\n\u201cIt is anticipated that medicines containing hydroxychloroquine sulfate will be made available to the national medical stockpile from a number of pharmaceutical companies,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cSome of these include generous donations funded by Mr Clive Palmer.\u201d\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Australia has also confirmed that it will provide doses. And the government is investing $1.5m to support guidance for clinicians to ensure they are given the best possible advice on managing Covid-19 patients.\nAn infectious diseases expert and former World Health Organization adviser, Prof Peter Collignon, said he was concerned the stockpiling was being driven by hype and panic.\n\u201cIt a very bad idea to have panic driving drugs we are going to give to people and chloroquine is just an example of panic,\u201d Collignon said.\n\u201cIt is very important to look at and evaluate these drugs around the world but to only issue these drugs after that evaluation. Or we run the risk of killing people.\n\u201cI would be worried about it being made available in the absence of strong trials and doctors make panicked decisions. Panic can blur good science and doing things safely.\u201d\nHe said Australia was not overwhelmed with patients in hospitals like New York and London were, so Australia had time to make careful and considered clinical decisions.\nDr Sacha Stelzer-Braid, a senior scientist in the virology research lab at the University of New South Wales and the Prince of Wales hospital, said while laboratory studies using hydroxychloroquine to inactivate the virus look promising, we still needed to be cautious about the possible use of the drug to shorten the duration of infection or even possibly prevent infection, if used prophylactically in healthcare workers, for example.\n\u201cWe do need to wait for the results of proper clinical trials to see whether the in vitro laboratory results translate to having any effects in humans,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt sounds like part of the stockpile will be used for these clinical trials in the first instance, which is a wise move. At the moment we don\u2019t have any antivirals that we can use against the virus, so I can understand the move to acquire a drug that has preliminary evidence as possibly effective. However, I think we still need to be careful and observe our usual protocols of clinical trials, albeit at a more accelerated rate than usual.\u201d",

        "content": "The gymnastics superstar has refused to commit to appearing at the next Olympics. Team USA would still be strong even without her though\nLast week when Simone Biles spoke to the press for the first time since the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, she failed to guarantee she would be back for the rescheduled Games in 2021. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided not to do it, but I haven\u2019t really decided to do it,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal.\nThis was not what we wanted to hear from one of the world\u2019s most exciting athletes. Biles was heading into Tokyo 2020 as the overwhelming favorite to win her second consecutive Olympic all-around title. That would have been a fitting capstone for the 23-year-old\u2019s record-breaking career. Though Biles had been adamant for the past year that she would retire after the 2020 Olympics, most assumed she would continue her career so she could compete in 2021 instead. Biles\u2019 reasons for not immediately committing to next\u2019s summer\u2019s Olympics are sensible: the toll another year of training would take on her already aching body; the desire to move on with her life; and another year of dealing with USA Gymnastics, one of the institutions that enabled former team doctor Larry Nassar to abuse Biles and dozens of other athletes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can deal with USAG for another year,\u201d she said.\nWhile I\u2019m still betting on Biles being in Tokyo next year, it\u2019s worth contemplating what a US effort without her would look like. She\u2019s been a key part of the program for eight years and it\u2019s hard to imagine the team without her.\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear about one thing \u2013 the US would still take the women\u2019s team title in Tokyo next year even without Biles. The American program has a deep bench, deeper than any other women\u2019s program. There is definitely a fourth (or fifth or eighth) gymnast that can put up strong scores across the board and help the American women secure victory.\nBut a Biles-less team win wouldn\u2019t look exactly the same. The point margins over the other top teams would be slimmer. At the 2019 world championships, Biles\u2019 floor score, for instance, was a point higher than the other two Americans, whose own floor scores were a point higher than the next best marks from Russia. The US will certainly be able to find another gymnast who can score in the same range as the other Americans but it\u2019s unlikely that they will find one who will score as Biles would. In 2015, gymnastics blogger Lauren Hopkins pointed out that \u201cbetween 2014 and 2015, the US team improved their final score by about two points. Of these two points, seven tenths came from Biles with the other 1.3 divided among the other four gymnasts.\u201d And this was before she started extending her all-around margins into \u201cfall more than once and still win\u201d territory. Also, Biles competed on all four apparatuses in team finals during the last three major team championships. Replacing Biles means replacing four scores in the team final.\nAnd then there\u2019s Biles\u2019 formidable individual medal haul. Biles in Tokyo probably means four gold medals \u2013 all-around, vault, beam, and floor. The US certainly has gymnasts that are capable of bringing in medals in all of those disciplines, but their medals are not as assured as Biles\u2019 are. The best bet for a US gold without Biles is vault where Jade Carey excels.\nBiles is a three-time world champion on the balance beam but her record is, by her standards, spotty. If she hits, she is one of the favorites to win but if she misses \u2013 as she did in 2016 and 2018 \u2013 she may end up with a medal but it won\u2019t be gold. But beam, in particular, is where the US is loaded with talent. There\u2019s Kara Eaker, who would have been world champion in 2018 if not for a mistake in the finals, and Morgan Hurd, a world silver medalist in 2017. As for floor, the US is reasonably assured of walking away with a medal there as well, perhaps even gold. Even without Biles, the Americans boast some of the best tumblers in the world.\nAnd finally, the most prestigious individual contest, the all-around final. Biles has dominated the all-around since her senior debut in 2013. The US certainly has other gymnasts who can win \u2013 the Americans won three consecutive Olympic all-around titles before Biles came on the scene \u2013 but their wins are not guaranteed. Sunisa Lee, like 2017 world champion Hurd and a couple of other Americans, can win the all-around title on a good day but only a good day. Only Biles can win it on a bad day.\nAll of this prognosticating is based on what the Olympics would have looked like this summer. But 2021 is not 2020. Over the next 16 months, a lot will change. Perhaps there will be injuries to the current group of top contenders. The year before the Games entails some of the most arduous training of a gymnast\u2019s career. The athletes, who were more than halfway through that year, will be forced to endure it all over again. For some, it will be too much. And there will be gymnasts who were already injured but will now perhaps have enough time to recover. In February, Asuka Teramoto of Japan ruptured her achilles. She was out of the picture for Tokyo 2020 but she could very well be back in the mix for 2021.\nThen there is a whole new crop of contenders who were too young to compete in Tokyo this year but will be 16 and therefore age eligible next year. Two of the most promising juniors who will now be able to compete in 2021 are Konnor McClain of the US and Viktoria Listunova of Russia. The former is the best junior gymnast in the US with enormous potential on balance beam; the latter is the reigning junior world champion. (The International Gymnastics Federation is set to decide what to do about the new seniors in regards to the 2021 Olympics in the next two weeks.)\nShortly after the Olympic postponement was announced, Yahoo Sports ran a story about McClain and her Olympic prospects if she competes at the 2021 Games. While McClain\u2019s coach was circumspect about her chances, noting that the gymnast\u2019s preparation had been oriented towards the 2024 Games, 2008 Olympic champion Shawn Johnson posited that McClain could be a potential rival for Biles due to the junior\u2019s youthfulness. That was a ridiculous assertion. While McClain, who was just 32 days shy of 2020 eligibility, is an enormously talented gymnast and an exciting prospect for the future, she has yet to compete as a senior. McClain has a lot to prove before she can be considered a rival to the GOAT.\nSo much can happen in a year. The future is always uncertain but it feels even more so during this pandemic. Biles, who has been a sure thing in gymnastics for the last eight years, won\u2019t give us the certainty we\u2019re desperately seeking by committing to 2021. She can\u2019t even give herself that kind of assurance. Biles, like the rest of us, is going to have to take this one day, one week, one month at a time.",

He continues to work out of the Foreign Office, rather than No 10, and weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen have been suspended rather than passed to Raab.\nNo 10 said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is the next in line to take over were Raab to become incapacitated.\nHow to help\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u00a0\nAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.\nDonate money or supplies\nThe Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.\nIf you want to help,\u00a0find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America\u2019s Covid-19 response fund.\nVolunteers\nFood banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u00a0Feeding America\u2019s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you\u2019re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, \u201cstay home\u201d is the advice.\nSocial media\nFeeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.\nAmid concern Johnson had been working too hard through his illness, Gove said Johnson had \u201cfollowed medical advice\u201d at all times.\nIn his round of broadcast interviews, Gove said the prime minister was fit, enjoyed tennis and had a \u201czest and appetite for life\u201d, so it was \u201cnaturally concerning\u201d how ill he was with coronavirus.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Gove said: \u201cHe\u2019s not on a ventilator. He has received oxygen support and one of the reasons for being in intensive care is that he can receive any support he needs.\u201d\nHours after his comments, Gove said he was now isolating at home because a member of his family had been displaying Covid-19 symptoms since Sunday. He will not be able to take the government\u2019s daily press conference in No 10 but can still chair and attend meetings from home.\nGove said Raab would be leading coronavirus response meetings and other cabinet committees but the \u201cprime minister always remains the prime minister\u201d.\nGove said \u201cdecisions would be taken collectively and following appropriate advice\u201d on when to end the lockdown. \u201cBut we do have to follow the lockdown advice because, as the prime minister\u2019s case so powerfully reminds us, this disease can hit any of us and it can hit very badly.\u201d\nGove said he could not talk about who had control of the nuclear codes if the country were to come under attack because it was a national security matter.\nHe rejected the idea of a national unity government but said the opposition had been \u201cexemplary\u201d in saying members would support a united national effort to beat coronavirus. \n The prime minister was moved to intensive care on Monday evening. He remained conscious.\nA No 10 spokesman said on Monday: \u201cOver the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.\n\u201cThe prime minister has asked foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.\u201d\nIntensive care beds are reserved for those who are very ill, and in the case of Covid-19, often those who need to be put on a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Since being admitted to St Thomas\u2019, Johnson, 55, is understood to have received oxygen through a non-invasive mask.\nHis pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms \u2013 was said to be deeply anxious about Johnson\u2019s condition.\nNews of his admission to hospital, 11 days after he developed a cough and high temperature, caused national and international concern, with world leaders from the US president, Donald Trump, to the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, sending their best wishes and hopes for Johnson\u2019s recovery.\nTrump said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019re very saddened to hear that [Johnson] was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special: strong, resolute, doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d\nShortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an \u201cincredibly strong team spirit\u201d behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place.\nHe said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care, and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic.\nBuckingham Palace said of the Queen: \u201cHer Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.\u201d",

Australia\u2019s name will be rubbish in the cruise at the end of this crisis,\u201d he said.\nHe said Cunard, part of the Carnival group, has been \u201cfantastic\u201d to the crew.\nThe Queen Elizabeth arrived in Sydney on 15 March after a short cruise to Tasmania and Melbourne. Before that it had been to Papua New Guinea.\nThat same day, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a ban on cruise ships. Dedman said the crew were permitted off the ship by health authorities and boarded again at 2am before travelling to Gladstone, where the ship has been moored since.\nOn 19 March the Ruby Princess returned from New Zealand, with several sick passengers on board. There is now a criminal investigation into how the ship was allowed to disembark more than 2,700 passengers in Sydney before test results for three passengers came back. The incident has led to more than 600 cases of Covid-19 in Australia and several deaths.\nThe Queen Elizabeth, along with all other cruise liners, has now been ordered out of Australian waters and is in Brisbane refuelling and taking on supplies before departing for an unknown destination.\nThe ship is flagged out of Bermuda but has Southhampton in the UK as its home port.\nDedman said he faces 14 days isolation in Brisbane, and possibly further isolation when he crosses back into NSW to return home.\nWhen he is not playing in cruise ship bands he runs bushcraft survival courses for the Army Reserve in northern Australia.",

But everyone is determined that it won\u2019t take education away from our children.\u201d\nAsked if schools will return in term 2, Tehan confirmed the Northern Territory will proceed \u201cas normal\u201d while Western Australia and South Australia are also considering their circumstances.\nJackson said that universities use \u201ca wide range of methods to assess and admit students \u2013 in addition to the Atar\u201d.\n\u201cFor year 12 students, these include assessment of a student\u2019s results across year 11 and 12, especially in the subjects most relevant to the degree the student has applied for,\u201d she said.\n\u201cUniversities can review portfolios of students\u2019 work and take extra-curricular activities into account.\n\u201cWhere appropriate, universities use aptitude tests. All universities offer a variety of bridging, foundation and enabling courses to prepare students for university, providing another pathway.\u201d",

It\u2019s cuteness overload on these farm cams\nThe UK lambing season peaks in March and April, so Easter is the perfect time to tune in for newborns taking their first steps \u2013 or even to witness a birth. The live stream from the barn at Walby Farm Park, Cumbria, shows a herd of ewes, including north of England mules and black-and-white jacobs, many of whom have had triplets. Farmer Neil also recorded a video message from inside the barn last week, to introduce viewers to the new arrivals.\nIn the fields of Marlfield Farm, on the border of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the sheep can be seen roaming the meadow as their babies frolic. Their small flock includes the UK\u2019s rarest breed, the boreray, and the north ronaldsay, another rarity.\nThere are two lamb cams streaming from the barns of National Forest Adventure Farm in Staffordshire, which at time of writing captured a lot of heavily pregnant sheep, but also a couple of wagging lamb\u2019s tails if you closely.\nThe live stream from Folly Farm in Pembrokeshire is currently focused on a large pen of kids in the barn. Expect climbing, jumping, head-butting and eating everything in sight. (Perhaps not unlike family life under quarantine.) Its herd includes pygmy, anglo-nubian, saanen, toggenburg and Welsh mountain goats. These baby goats are occasionally videobombed by neighbouring sheep and donkeys.\nThere are plenty of joy-inducing streams being beamed across the Atlantic too, including from Beekman Farm in Sharon Springs, New York state. The small herd here helps produce goat\u2019s milk soap and other cruelty-free skincare products. As it\u2019s kidding season, the camera focuses on the nursery, so you may catch a pile of sleepy characters or, when dinner arrives, plenty of mischief.\nThe goat cam page for family-run Symon Says Farms in Salem, Connecticut, includes a list of all the babies born this season, with names and weights to help viewers get to know the herd.\nThe chickens at Flying Skunk Farm live in the yard of a small farm on the Massachusetts coast. The page also includes a live chat feature, to talk to fellow friends of the fowl, who told us some of their names. They include Big Al, the cream amberlink, and Goldie, a gold hen, alongside barred rocks and a Polish crested polka dot breed with a spiky hairdo. The site is so popular that a hall of fame has been created using image stills from the site.\nTaking virtual farm experiences to the next level, the Coop Cam from Joe Vitale in New Jersey allows viewers to actually feed the chickens. For every 20 new subscribers, or for a \u201cSuper Chat donation\u201d added in the comments, the hens will get an automated treat from the feed dispenser. The brood here includes Houdini, who lays blue eggs, Sassafras, Cluck Norris and the Triplets. The stream also includes a picture-in-picture view of the upstairs of the coop, where eggs are laid throughout the day.\nSpy on sunbathing piglets from Centennial Farm, part of the Orange County fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, California. And on the green hills of Wisconsin Pasture Farm Sanctuary in upstate New York, there are grazing alpacas, sheep and cows hanging out together, plus a turkey barn and a pig named Honey \u2013 with her recently adopted babies, Cameron and Ben David.",

On his inaugural visit to India in February, Trump declared Modi an \u201cexceptional leader\u201d and \u201ctrue friend\u201d.\nDuring a press briefing at the White House on Monday, Trump said: \u201cI spoke to him [Modi] Sunday morning, called him, and I said we\u2019d appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn\u2019t allow it to come out, that would be OK, but of course, there may be retaliation. Why wouldn\u2019t there be?\u201d\nIn recent days, Trump has developed a public obsession with hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure for coronavirus, boasting that the US had already stockpiled 29m doses of the drug. The basis for the president\u2019s proclamations of the drug as a \u201cgame changer\u201d is a study carried out by a group of scientists in March, but the results have been openly dismissed by experts and major medical bodies.\nNonetheless, despite the dubious medical evidence, the drug is now being given to 1,500 patients who have tested positive for coronavirus in New York.\nIndia\u2019s neighbouring countries, such as Sri Lanka and Nepal, have also put in orders for the drug. India said it would consider all exports on a case-by-case basis.\nIndia is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of pharmaceuticals and last month put export restrictions on dozens of drugs, including paracetamol and various antibiotics, in order to preserve domestic supply. The Indian government confirmed on Tuesday they would also be partially lifting the ban on paracetamol exports.",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Ben Doherty bringing you the main stories on Tuesday 7 April.\nAustralia\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has reached 48, following two deaths in Western Australia and one in Tasmania.\nA woman in her 70s, who recently returned from overseas and was staying in a Perth hotel as a part of mandatory quarantine, died at the Royal Perth hospital. A man in his 70s, who was a passenger on the Artania cruise ship, died at Joondalup health campus.\nIn Tasmania, a man in his 80s, yet another passenger on the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship, died. That ship is now the original source of more than 660 infections, and at least 13 deaths. A criminal investigation is under way by New South Wales police into how it was allowed to dock at Circular Quay and its passengers disembark when there were signs of Covid-19 onboard.\nAlso on Tuesday, the government released modelling on the potential curve of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 spread.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, stressed the modelling was theoretical and was not based on case data. It does not predict what will happen in Australia in terms of how many people will contract the virus or will die from the virus, or how long it will last in Australia.\nThe modelling, he said, drew on a broader international dataset, and bolstered\u200b the rationale behind \u2018flattening the curve\u2019: which is what Australia is seeing now as a result of its interventions (particularly border closures) with a steady reduction in the number of new infections each day.\nThe interventions were \u201ccontrolling the spread, boosting the capacity of our health system, and buying time, giving us the opportunity for more choices\u201d, Morrison said.\nThe chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, reported there were 5,844 confirmed cases of Covid-19, fewer than 100 people in ICUs and fewer than 40 people on ventilators.\nThe major concern for state and federal health bodies was 500 community transmissions where authorities do not know the source of the infection.\n\u201cThat is why we cannot relax what we have been doing,\u201d Murphy said.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has forced a staggering 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector to reduce the hours of their staff and 43% to either sack workers or place them on unpaid leave, new data shows.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics has released new data showing the pandemic\u2019s impact on business, based on a survey of 3,000 companies in the days after the government\u2019s tough social distancing restrictions were announced on 29 March.\nTwo-thirds of businesses across all sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to Covid-19.\nRoughly the same number reported they had suffered decreased demand.\nTwo in five businesses said they had changed how they delivered goods or services, one-third said they had renegotiated their leases, and one in four had deferred loan repayments.\nAbout one in 10 said they had paused trading altogether. In 70% of cases, this was due to Covid-19.\nA number of Aboriginal health groups in Victoria have been forced to cease Covid-19 testing and consider shutting their doors due to a lack of personal protective equipment.\nThe Guardian revealed last week that Aboriginal medical services in NSW, particularly in regional areas, were struggling to access the PPE needed to safely treat and test for the virus.\nSome clinics had just two weeks of PPE left with no immediate prospect of resupply, creating a situation they described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.\nAustralia\u2019s federal government has launched a new attempt to find more domestic manufacturers to supply it with the materials needed for Covid-19 testing, a move the crossbench senator Rex Patrick says has started too late.\nOn Friday, the government issued a callout seeking Australian companies that may be able to manufacture various components used in Covid-19 testing, including the sterile tubes used to store and transport swabs, nucleic acid extraction kits, and essential chemicals.\nThe process is designed to better gauge Australia\u2019s capability to manufacture such material locally, in the face of extraordinary global demand and pressure on existing supply chains.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,\u201d Dr David Clark said in a statement.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?\nAm I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

He is thought to be the first health worker in Wales to die after a Covid-19 diagnosis.\nA statement posted on the Cardiff and Vale University health board website paid tribute to Rathod, saying that he had worked in the cardiothoracic surgery department since the mid-1990s.\nAfter a brief stint abroad, Rathod \u2013 known as Jitu to colleagues and friends \u2013 returned to the University Hospital of Wales.\n\u201cHe was an incredibly dedicated surgeon who cared deeply for his patients,\u201d the health board said. \u201cHe was well liked and greatly respected by one and all. He was a very compassionate and a wonderful human being.\n\u201cHis commitment to the speciality was exemplary. He is survived by his wife and two sons.

The former lawyer was born in 1974, and is the son of a Czech refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938. He studied at both Oxford and Cambridge, and when working for the Foreign Office his job was to lead a team attempting to bring suspected war criminals to justice at The Hague.\nA vocal supporter of Britain\u2019s move to leave the EU, Raab was briefly the Brexit secretary under Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May, but resigned after saying he could not agree to the withdrawal deal that had been struck between her government and the EU.\nThe 46-year-old returned to government in July 2019, when Johnson became prime minister. Raab holds the title of first secretary of state, as well as foreign secretary, and is in effect the prime minister\u2019s deputy.\nWhile Johnson is incapacitated, Raab will chair emergency Cobra meetings about the coronavirus outbreak, and the cabinet. Since the UK is a parliamentary democracy, there is no need for an election to take place for him to assume the role of de facto prime minister.\nLike many of the Johnson government\u2019s key decision-makers, he was a prominent figure in the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, sent out to tour TV studios and staff up the spin rooms for debates.\nUnlike Michael Gove, whose dramatic intervention in 2016\u2019s Conservative party leadership contest has been forgiven but not forgotten, Raab is implicitly trusted by Johnson and his team. Also unlike Gove, his resignation on principle over May\u2019s Brexit deal was seen as the ultimate test of a true believer.\nRaab\u2019s own unsuccessful attempt to run for the Conservative leadership last year was masterminded by Paul Stephenson, another Vote Leave veteran. Conveniently, Raab\u2019s no-holds-barred Brexit stance allowed Johnson to appear to be the moderate leaver during his leadership campaign.\nStephenson, who now runs a PR consultancy, Hanbury Strategy, was subsequently brought in to work on the Conservatives\u2019 2019 general election campaign.\nAnd he has been given the task of sifting through potential applicants for special adviser posts in government, as Johnson\u2019s director of communications, Lee Cain, another Vote Leaver, tries to shake up the usual recruitment process.\nHis involvement, like Raab\u2019s role as designated last man standing, underlines the fact that when Johnson\u2019s team are looking for backup, they tend to reach first for their battle-hardened comrades from the referendum campaign.",

Last year the New York Times published an exhaustive investigation, notably including recordings of Russian pilots, that directly incriminated Russia in attacks on hospitals in rebel areas.\nHRW\u2019s director, Kenneth Roth, wrote on Twitter: \u201cUN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres gave an excessively narrow mandate to a board of inquiry into attacks on hospitals in Syria, and the inquiry now produces a mealy-mouthed report, all to avoid offending Russia, the prime offender along with Syria.\u201d\nIn July last year the security council issued a rare formal diplomatic petition demanding Guterres open an investigation into airstrikes on medical facilities.\nThe move infuriated Moscow, which has repeatedly used international forums \u2013 such as its veto as a permanent member of the UN security council \u2013 to shield Assad from international action. Since intervening in the Syrian war on the regime\u2019s behalf in 2015, Russia has repeatedly denied that its own aircraft target civilian sites.\nGuterres attributed the small number of incidents examined in the new report to the absence of UN personnel on the ground and refusal of permission to visit the sites.\nThe commission looked at bombings carried out between April and July 2019 in Idlib and the surrounding countryside. One hospital was deselected for not meeting the investigation\u2019s criteria, and a raid on a refugee camp was likely to have been carried out by an Islamist group, the report said.\nThe board of inquiry was established in September and its report was supposed to have been submitted by the end of 2019 but was delayed until March.\nWestern countries have been demanding for months that a summary of the report be published. Media reports suggest Russian diplomats pressured Guterres\u2019s office not to release it.\nThe Syrian and Russian delegations to the UN did not immediately comment on the findings.",

        "content": "Scott Morrison warns Covid-19 gains could be undermined if people start to ignore physical distancing rules\nAustralia\u2019s gains in slowing the spread of coronavirus could be undermined if people start to ignore physical distancing rules, the Morrison government warned, as it released modelling of the potential strain on the health system.\nAfter facing weeks of calls to release the evidence it is using to justify sweeping restrictions on social and economic life, the government published material on Tuesday that is based on the impact of strategies that have been rolled out around the world \u2013 but not Australian case numbers.\nIf there were an unchecked outbreak in Australia, the modelling suggests, some 35,000 intensive care beds could be required at its peak \u2013 something that would be well beyond the country\u2019s capacity to provide.\nBut the modelling also suggests that with isolation and quarantine measures in place, ICU demand drops to 17,000 at the peak of an outbreak. When these measures are combined with physical distancing, the peak demand may drop below 5,000.\nOn the eve of the resumption of parliament for a special one-day sitting, the government said the work was \u201chighly theoretical\u201d and experts would require another few weeks to prepare further modelling based on Australian case numbers.\nBut Scott Morrison said the existing restrictions were helping to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and \u201cbuying time\u201d so that governments across the country could decide the best options for Australia in the months ahead.\nThe prime minister said part of the country\u2019s \u201cmodest success to date\u201d meant that the number of cases of community transmission \u2013 fewer than 1 in 10 confirmed cases \u2013 was still quite low, which did not present a very big case base for more detailed Australian modelling.\n\u201cFor now, and certainly over the weeks ahead, though, the lesson is simple, and that is that we must continue to do what we are doing \u2013 that is how we get through this,\u201d Morrison said.\n\u201cWe have bought valuable time, but we cannot be complacent. We must keep the tension in the cord. This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.\u201d\nThe Doherty Institute \u2013 which prepared the modelling work for the Department of Health \u2013 briefed journalists via videoconference later on Tuesday.\nJames McCaw, a professor of mathematical biology and infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, said the team had started new work \u201cin the last few days\u201d to provide Australian governments with short-term outlooks on transmission, future load on the health system, and potential responses.\nHe likened it to pivoting from long-term climate outlooks to daily weather forecasts. How that would be released to the public would be up to the government.\nThe modelling was released after the latest meeting of the national cabinet of state and territory leaders.\nThe leaders agreed to a mandatory code of conduct to govern the renegotiation of commercial leases, but Morrison said residential tenancies would be dealt with separately by each state and territory, with no baselines beyond the six-month moratorium on evictions.\nThe code governs leases for tenants with an annual turnover of $50m or less that also meet the threshold for jobkeeper payments, a reduction in turnover of at least 30%.\nCommercial landlords and distressed tenants will negotiate rent reductions in proportion to the decline in the tenant\u2019s turnover through a combination of deferral and waivers of rent, overseen by binding mediation.\nWaivers of rent must account for 50%, at least, of the reduction in the rental provided to the tenant during that period, Morrison said. Deferred rent can be paid back over the remaining lease period, or at least 24 months.\nDespite signs that national cabinet was moving towards a system of using land tax reductions to encourage residential landlords to offer rent reductions, Morrison said residential tenancies will \u201cnow be dealt with directly by each of the state and territory jurisdictions\u201d.\nThe Australian Capital Territory has already announced a six-month scheme offering waivers of land tax capped at $1,300 a quarter, with the government to share rent reductions 50/50 with landlords.\nOn Tuesday, Labor\u2019s shadow housing minister, Jason Clare, praised the ACT plan as \u201ca pretty smart idea\u201d and \u201ca great incentive for landlords and tenants to sit down and to work a way through this\u201d. Similar proposals are in development in other states, although some favour a less generous three-month period of land tax waivers.\nOn Tuesday, the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, released final draft legislation of the government\u2019s $130bn jobkeeper legislation, to be debated on Wednesday and passed with Labor support.\nUnder the legislation, employers claiming the $1,500 fortnightly payment on behalf of employees would be allowed to activate a \u201cjobkeeper enabling stand-down\u201d and alter their employees\u2019 hours of work if they can\u2019t be usefully employed at their full hours as a result of Covid-19.\nEmployers will be able to alter the usual duties and location of employees\u2019 work, provided it is safe, reasonable, inside the employee\u2019s competency and the employer\u2019s usual scope of work.\nEmployers and employees can agree to vary the days worked, and agree to expend leave entitlements until just two weeks of annual leave remain, while the employer claims jobkeeper and pays it on to the employee. This must be by agreement, but an employee cannot \u201cunreasonably refuse\u201d.\nAll three measures will be overseen by the Fair Work Commission, after negotiations of safeguards with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.",

Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon.\n\u201cWe look forward to launching Archewell when the time is right.\u201d\nA source said the list of trademarking categories was extensive for \u201cprotection purposes only\u201d, and urged caution about \u201cpicking out specific items\u201d to try to predict what the couple will actually do.\nDespite the application including \u201csupport groups\u201d for the emotional wellbeing of people in need, it is understood there are no plans for such groups. Further details would be released in due course.\nFrom the application it appears the couple are contemplating their own awards for \u201centities and individuals who have made significant charitable contributions\u201d.\nArchewell would also be used for downloadable magazines, audio books, motion picture films and television shows. Fiction and non-fiction books are listed, along with calendars, posters, stationery, journals and even paperclips. Clothing items include socks, rainwear, footwear and headwear.\nUnder charitable services, the application lists promoting public awareness for a variety of causes and developing and co-ordinating volunteer programmes and community service projects. There is mention, too, of a website featuring content related to philanthropy, and charitable fundraising including scholarships for programmes and grants, and organising special events.\nLast week, the couple bowed out of the royal family with a final post on their official SussexRoyal Instagram account, which will now remain inactive along with their website.",

You can wall us up behind the front door with Netflix and newsagent wine. But don\u2019t take away our glimpse of the sky, that prescribed 30 minutes of brain-soothing, body-stretching exercise.\nJudging by the experiences of Spain, Italy and France, this is the next stage for the UK. Quite how long we can put off a complete ban on personal exercise is open to question. But a concerted effort is required here because, with the weather this week forecast to reach as a high as 23C, this really could be a tipping point.\nPublic pressure suggests it\u2019s coming. One of the most heartening aspects of the period of confinement has been a shared counter-commentary, the feeling, expressed often from the fringes, that this might just be a chance to reset and restart, to remake our world as a kinder, gentler place.\nIt remains to be seen quite how this fits with the sheer effort of will required to ensure the No 1 UK trending Twitter topic on Sunday night was #selfishpricks, a response to the suspicion too many people had given in to weakness, cabin fever and springtime muscle memory and gone out to run or walk or lie around in public space.\nBy Monday morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had rowed back a little on the veiled threat to enforce a ban on outdoor exercise. But this in itself should be taken with a pinch of salt, at a time when nothing is off the table, no policy is fixed, and nothing that seemed extreme on Sunday night can be ruled out by Wednesday morning.\nMake no mistake. When this does come, when parks and public spaces are finally closed, it will be one of the most destructive side-effects of this pandemic to date. A disaster for physical and mental health; a disaster for sport at recreational and junior levels; and a disaster for the trajectory of both the national health and its keeper, the National Health Service.\nThere are two issues here. First, how serious is this problem really? Our cities are crowded places. Many people have no outdoor space at all. It is impossible to stay out of one another\u2019s sight completely. No doubt there is a hardcore of the ill-informed, the antisocial and those who just won\u2019t or can\u2019t obey the rules. These groups should be ruthlessly policed. But most people do understand how to protect themselves.\nJogging two metres from anyone else, dodging off the pavement, being aware at all times of your distance: these are habits the average citizen is learning to keep. One person\u2019s enraging iPhone pic of a crowded park scene is another\u2019s intricate network of carefully maintained personal spaces. Mainly, though, the prospect of a ban on outdoor exercise must be taken on its own terms. Any decision on public governance is a balance of cost and benefits. This one would be catastrophic for so many people.\nIt is a mark of how perverse the situation is that the same department of health currently ordering the nation to stay inside was publishing advice in October 2019 urging us to do exactly the opposite. Public Health England\u2019s paper states that \u201cphysical inactivity is responsible for one in six UK deaths and is estimated to cost the UK \u00a37.4bn annually\u201d.\nYes, you read that right: one in six deaths. Inactivity is not a neutral state. It also has a profound cost. Loss of movement and physical activity is both habit\u2011forming and often irrecoverable for those of advanced age. Plus there is the more immediate effect on the nation\u2019s mental health. The same government paper concludes: \u201cPhysical activity has significant benefits for health, both physical and mental, and can help to prevent and manage over 20 chronic conditions and diseases, including ... depression.\u201d\nBut then, we don\u2019t need a study to tell us this. As long ago as the European plagues of the middle ages, green space and fresh air were being prescribed as balms to melancholia. Sport, exercise, sunlight: these are a form of preventative care for many people who experience mental health problems or skate close to the edge. Removing access to these things will come with a huge hidden cost.\nOn a separate scale it would also close an escape hatch for those whose isolation means confinement in what might be an unsafe place. The National Domestic Abuse hotline had a 25% increase in requests for help in the past week via website and phone. This is bigger than just sport or exercise. Humans need the freedom to escape one another now and then.\nBut it is also about sport and exercise, the absence of which hits young people hardest. As the government\u2019s own report states: \u201cThere is strong evidence that regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits for children.\u201d This stretches from teenagers whose physicality demands that, like dogs, they need to run around at least once a day, to those who benefit from being steered away from isolation.\nSports science suggests there are permanent physical benefits to physical exertion in your growth years. Something irrecoverable will be lost when that right to exercise is taken away. It is a cost that will be felt by some more than others. Data suggests children from low\u2011income backgrounds are already less physically active than those from wealthier backgrounds, and three times more likely to be obese by the age of 11.\nConfinement seems likely to supercharge this process, to further politicise exercise and the outdoors. If you have a garden, or space at home, or a parent with resources already engaged in curating your recreation, you will most likely find a way to continue that. For others the lockdown will mean chronic, often cramped inactivity.\nWhat, then, is the alternative? There are plenty of mitigating options the government could look at before that point is reached. Policing public spaces more aggressively is one thing. But why not attack it from a better angle? Do we really want to be a nation that bans exercise before it bans smoking and the sale of tobacco? Surely better to ban eating or drinking alcohol in public if you really want to disperse the wrong kind of crowd? At another extreme, how about making everyone wear masks or a face covering in public?\nIt is here that ideas of freedom and responsibility start to collide. Our social existence is built around things that restrict or funnel our access to the land around us, from street furniture, to rights of way and public spaces. There is always compromise, always managed space. How far the public is able to police its own use of it right now might just dictate how long that vital freedom can be retained.",

The US is now third worst-affected, with 10,993 deaths \u2013 3,485 in New York City alone.\nJapanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has declared a state of emergency to fight new coronavirus infections in major population centres. He also unveiled a stimulus package he described as among the world\u2019s biggest to soften the economic blow. Abe announced the state of emergency targeting the capital Tokyo and six other prefectures \u2013 accounting for about 44% of Japan\u2019s population \u2013 for a period of about one month.\n\u201cWe have decided to declare a state of emergency because we\u2019ve judged that a fast spread of the coronavirus nationwide would have an enormous impact on lives and the economy,\u201d he told parliament earlier.\nA number of French cities, including Nice, have announced they plan to make face masks mandatory for those who go out. The mayor of Nice, the capital of the French Riviera, has said all city inhabitants will receive a mask within eight to 10 days that they can reuse for a month. Cannes and a few other places are following suit, and the capital, Paris, has said it is considering introducing the rule.\nFrench authorities have also tightened their lockdown measures in the capital by banning Parisians from outdoors sports activity between 10am and 7pm local time, aiming to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\nThe British prime minister was moved to intensive care on Monday night after his condition worsened. Donald Trump paid tribute to Johnson at his daily White House briefing: \u201cI found him to be a fantastic person, a fantastic warm strong smart guy. He loves his country, you see that. He fought like hell for his country. But intensive care is big stuff, really big stuff.\u201d The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will run the country\u2019s coronavirus response in Johnson\u2019s absence.\nThe pace of coronavirus deaths in Spain increased slightly on Tuesday for the first time in five days, with 743 people succumbing overnight to reach a total of 13,798. That compared with 637 people who died during the previous 24 hours in the nation with the second highest toll of fatalities from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n Total cases rose to 140,510 on Tuesday from 135,032 on Monday, the health ministry said.\nMainland China reported a drop in the number of new coronavirus cases after closing its borders to virtually all foreigners to curb imported infections.\nIt comes as the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, had no new deaths for the first time. China had 32 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Monday, down from 39 cases a day earlier, the national health commission said. All of the 32 cases involved travellers arriving from overseas, compared with 38 imported cases a day earlier.\n  The overall number of imported infections so far stands at 983, the health authority said.",

After a public backlash the company subsequently moved to furlough staff under the government\u2019s job retention scheme.\nThe company also made a thinly veiled swipe at the Hollywood studio Universal, which has decided to make expected blockbuster Trolls World Tour available on all digital and pay-TV platforms globally on 10 April, instead of delaying its launch for an exclusive release in cinemas later in the year to help operators recover.\n\u201cWith very few exceptions, the good relationships we have built up over the years have been supportive and understanding of our efforts,\u201d the company said.\nGreidinger was more direct in comments to a trade magazine in the US, saying Universal\u2019s decision was a \u201cone-sided move against exhibition [in cinemas], and also a huge business mistake. You do not change the basic rules of the game \u2026 especially when your partner is in its worst situation.\u201d\nThe company, the UK\u2019s biggest operator, said it would continue to \u201cmonitor\u201d the progress of its $2.1bn (\u00a31.7bn) deal to buy Canada\u2019s Cineplex. If Cineworld were to pull out of the deal it could face a break-fee of up to \u00a328m.\nCineworld\u2019s shares, which have hit a record low since the onset of the pandemic, were up 36% at 54p on Tuesday morning.

The Vatican said it had always had confidence in Australian judicial authorities and reaffirmed the Holy See\u2019s \u201ccommitment to preventing and pursuing all cases of abuse against minors\u201d.\nFrancis did not mention Pell by name at mass, but compared the suffering of those inflicted with \u201cunjust sentences\u201d to the way Jewish community elders persecuted Jesus with \u201cobstinacy and rage even though he was innocent\u201d.\nEach morning at the mass, Francis chooses an intention for the service, such as remembering the poor, the homeless or the sick. In recent weeks, the pope\u2019s intentions for nearly all of his daily masses have been related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe pope also tweeted about the persecution of Jesus, without making specific reference to Pell. \u201cIn these days of Lent, we\u2019ve been witnessing the persecution that Jesus underwent and how He was judged ferociously, even though He was innocent.\n\u201cLet us pray together today for all those persons who suffer due to an unjust sentence because someone had it in for them.\u201d\nPell was number three in the Vatican hierarchy, in charge of the Holy See\u2019s finances and of rooting out corruption.\nHis five-year term as Vatican treasurer expired just days before he was sentenced in February last year. Pope Francis had removed him from his inner council of advisers two months earlier.\nThe Vatican said last year that it would wait for the judicial process to be exhausted before taking any further action.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/07-45297-FS_Pell.mp3\nPell is three years past the age at which bishops and Vatican officials normally hand in their resignation, is not expected to return to a Holy See job.\nThe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith \u2013 the Vatican\u2019s disciplinary department \u2013 is expected now to consider the accusations against Pell and could order a canonical trial. But it would be an extraordinary turn of events if the outcome was different to the ruling of the appeal court.\nAnne Barrett Doyle, co-director of advocacy group BishopAccountability.org, said the court\u2019s decision had been widely expected.\n\u201cThough distressing to many survivors, the decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that the trial of the powerful cardinal was a watershed,\u201d she said.\nOf the 78 Catholic bishops worldwide who have been publicly accused of child sexual abuse, very few have faced criminal charges, and fewer than 10 have been tried in a secular courtroom, she said.\n\u201cYet that is where all of these cases belong. While messy and painful, a judicial process in a democratic society is immeasurably better than that of a Vatican tribunal, which keeps its proceedings secret,\u201d she added.",

If approved, the company said it could produce 2,000 a week.\nThe James Fisher ventilators are not designed for intensive care use, but the company said they can be used to relieve pressure on ICU beds by providing breathing support in \u201cpre-critical temporary wards or care homes\u201d.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/03/30-39918-FSVentilatorsv2.mp3\nThe Barrow-in-Furness company normally maintains and supports offshore and subsea oil and gas operations and has experience in making breathing aids for divers.\nEoghan O\u2019Lionaird, its chief executive, said: \u201cOur extensive experience in breathing gas reclaim systems for the offshore diving industry, gives us a unique perspective into how best to deliver oxygen to patients safely, effectively and efficiently. Our new InVicto ventilator does this, not only helping to save lives but also preserving crucial oxygen reserves at a time when global supplies are under considerable strain.\u201d\nJames Fisher is the latest in a string of companies to answer Boris Johnson\u2019s call for companies to urgently design and produce new ventilators.\nDefence contractor Babcock said on Monday it will manufacture 10,000 such machines. Dyson, the manufacturing firm run by billionaire inventor Sir James Dyson, has received a UK government order for 10,000. Both devices still have to pass stringent MHRA tests before they can be accepted for medical use.\nVentilator Challenge UK, a consortium including more than a dozen engineering firms, has an order for 15,000. It expected to deliver 30 this week, but could take until early next month to reach its 1,500-a-week peak production target.\nA ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide.\nThe Mercedes Formula 1 team said on Tuesday it will this week begin delivering up to 10,000 breathing devices to the NHS, as part of F1\u2019s Project Pitlane effort. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, which help coronavirus patients breathe more easily but are not ventilators, were developed by Mercedes engineers in partnership with University College London and doctors at its linked hospital.\nThe devices are being produced at a rate of 1,000 a day at the Mercedes factory in Brixworth, Northamptonshire. The entire facility has been repurposed to produce the CPAP devices, with 40 machines that would normally produce F1 pistons and turbochargers dedicated to the rollout.",

When the pandemic forced the closure of the park on 26 January, the 14-year-olds were halfway through the panda\u2019s average lifespan and almost a decade past the start of sexual maturity.\nBut, after more than two months of being alone together, the couple have recently shown signs they were in the mood for love. Local reports say Ying Ying \u2013 in her oestrogen cycle \u2013 spent more time in the water and Le Le left more scent markings around the enclosure.\nOn Monday morning, the pair were seen cuddling more intensely than usual and then finally did what comes naturally, much to the delight of park managers.\n\u201cThe successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,\u201d Michael Boos, executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, noted in a press release.\nIt is not yet clear if Li Li is pregnant but vets say hormone fluctuations and behavioural changes may give a clue by late June. \u201cWe hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year,\u201d Boos said.\nHe said a panda cub would contribute to the conservation of a vulnerable species. Once the lockdown ends, such a popular draw could also rescue the tourist resort, which has recently reported financial difficulties.\nThe commercially-oriented park made no mention of the likelihood that the pandas were finally able to breed thanks to reduced stress from intrusive crowds. Instead it said the animals\u2019 \u201csuccess\u201d was attributable to years of \u201ctrial and learning\u201d, and the collaboration of experts from the Hong Kong park and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong.\nZoologists have long argued the panda\u2019s reputation for a low sex drive was misleading because it was based solely on captive animals.\n\u201cThe problems often attributed to them \u2013 short penises, narrow vaginas and low sex drives \u2013 are not an issue in the wild,\u201d Jim Harkness, a panda expert and the former China representative for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said. \u201cIt is a phoney issue to say that pandas face a breeding crisis that we have to solve.\u201d\nHe said the best way to protect the endangered species was to extend its habitat in the wild.",

        "content": "Posted to Leman Street in the East End of London in 1964, the police detective Leonard \u201cNipper\u201d Read, who has died aged 95, was asked whether there was any reason he should not head a team to look into the activities of the Kray twins, Reggie and Ronnie. He was justifiably annoyed at the implication that he might be on their payroll.\nIn the event his inquiry at that stage was unsuccessful: with witnesses reluctant to give evidence and a crucial one changing his story the pair were acquitted of demanding money with menaces from Huw McCowan, a London club owner. Read\u2019s annoyance pointed to the integrity characteristic of an effective and distinguished career.\nIn March 1966, he was promoted to detective chief inspector and sent to West End Central, where he formed a squad to shut down the illegal clubs and beer joints before the arrival of visitors for the football World Cup.\nThe next year he was promoted to detective chief superintendent and attached to the Murder Squad with the specific brief of investigating the murders of George Cornell, shot in the Blind Beggar public house in the East End, and another Kray associate, Jack \u201cThe Hat\u201d McVitie. Read, fearful of his progress being leaked to the Krays, established his office away from Scotland Yard at Tintagel House, on the southern side of the Thames, in Vauxhall. He was wise to take precautions, because during the investigation a hired gunman was caught at Shannon airport on his way to kill him.\nHe first concentrated on the twins\u2019 fraud activities, and once they were in custody in 1968 he was able, with infinite patience, to persuade the barmaid who had seen the Cornell shooting and the woman in whose flat the McVitie killing had taken place to give evidence. In the guise of a vicar, he visited the Krays\u2019 lieutenant Albert Donoghue in Brixton and persuaded him to give evidence about a third murder, that of Frank Mitchell, the so-called Mad Axeman, whom the twins had helped escape from Dartmoor prison and then had killed when he began to threaten them. In 1969 the Krays received life sentences for the first two murders, but were acquitted of the murder of Mitchell.\nRead had never been an inside man at Scotland Yard, and had refused invitations on a number of occasions to join the Flying Squad. He said he did not like sitting on observation in smoke-filled cars day in and out, but rather he was distancing himself from the corruption rife among some members of the squad. He was too much his own man for some tastes and, effectively passed over for further promotion, he returned to Nottingham in 1970 as assistant chief constable before becoming national co-ordinator of the Regional Crime Squads (1972-76).\nBorn in Nottingham, Read was the son of Leonard Sr, who worked for a leather firm, and his wife, Ida (nee Morris). She died when the boy was four, and he was sent to stay with her brother. When his father remarried, he and his two sisters and brother returned home. Later Read would point out that, while in no way blaming his father, the Kray twins for all their pleading poverty had fared much better as children than he and his siblings had done.\nRead did well at school, never being out of the first three in his class in either junior or senior school. He learned to box, winning his first medal in 1937 when he weighed 29kg (4st 7lb). Later he joined the Grundy Boxing Club, which was where he was nicknamed Nipper.\nWhen he was 14 he left school. He had hoped to go to Nottingham high school and had passed the entrance examination, but his father could not afford the uniform and fees for books. In later life, Read resented the fact he had not been able to stretch himself academically. He took a job in a Player\u2019s cigarette warehouse in 1939, earning 10 shillings (50p) a week, giving eight to his stepmother. He was called up in 1943, joining the Royal Navy, from which he was demobbed in 1946 with the rank of petty officer and a determination not to return to the tobacco factory.\nHe could not join the Nottingham police force, which then had a minimum height regulation of 6ft and in 1947 scraped into the Metropolitan police, which took men at 5ft 8in, telling the medical examiner he was still growing. It was his lack of height that propelled his career. He was taken out of the uniform branch, because his small stature did not meet its requirements.\nHe became an aide to CID, and was used in disguise, on the basis that no one would believe he was a police officer. He had played the lead in David Copperfield in the school play and his acting ability came in useful as, over the years, he would, among other guises, be a painter and decorator, a GPO linesman, a racing cyclist, a chauffeur, a roadsweeper, milkman and a delivery boy. Throughout his early years in the Met he continued to box.\nAs a detective constable, he was sent to Harlesden, in north-west London, where he worked under the famous officer Bert Hannam, known as Suits, a man who dressed like a banker and had an almost photographic memory, but who, with implications and hints, was able to create an atmosphere of prejudice against a defendant.\nRead was then transferred to Paddington, where the senior first-class sergeant was the highly regarded Tommy Butler, who later led the London end of the investigation of the Great Train Robbery. Unfortunately, Butler was also highly secretive and so Read learned his trade from the other first-class sergeant, Frank Gloyne. At Paddington, Read was on the periphery of the Jack Spot case, when the so-called King of the Underworld asked for protection against his rival Billy Hill.\nIn 1958, Read was promoted to detective sergeant and transferred to Chelsea, where he replaced Ray Purdy, who had been killed by the burglar and blackmailer Guenther Podola. While there he was seconded to Buckinghamshire after the Great Train Robbery, from a Glasgow train in August 1963. It was an experience that introduced him to the investigation of a major crime, but also to the infighting and bickering of officers as they pressed towards the limelight. Following it, he was promoted to detective inspector at Leman Street.\nIn 1977 he retired from the police, having received the Queen\u2019s Police Medal the previous year. He became national security adviser to the National Museums and Galleries Commission (1978-86), a position set up after the theft of Goya\u2019s Duke of Wellington.\nThroughout his life he had maintained his interest in boxing, and in 1976 joined the British Boxing Board of Control, serving first on the southern area council and as a steward before becoming its chair in 1996 and president in 1997.\nIt was he who saw the board through its painful period of reconstruction after the action brought by the boxer Michael Watson over the treatment of injuries suffered during his contest with Chris Eubank in 1991.\nRead also served as a vice-president of the World Boxing Association (1989-2001) and a senior vice-president of the World Boxing Council (1997-2001). He retired from the British Boxing Board of Control in 2000 and spent some of his leisure time lecturing on the Kray case on cruise ships.\nA neat, meticulous and often obstinate man who commanded respect and loyalty, he did not fit in well with the rough, tough and hard-drinking image of Scotland Yard of his day. One example of his obstinacy was his belief that two young children had been murdered in Enfield, north London, in 1970. He was told they had died from exposure and to close the case; but he never accepted the decision. He was vindicated when, in 1999, a paedophile already serving life imprisonment admitted the killings.\nEarly in Read\u2019s career, he had suffered a blackout which was diagnosed as exhaustion. In 1989, while holidaying, he underwent a convulsive fit and it was realised that he had had epilepsy throughout his life. Had this been diagnosed earlier, he would have been retired from the force almost before his career had started. He regarded himself as a fortunate man.\nIn 1951 he married Marion Millar; they divorced in 1979. In 1980 he married Pat Allen, who had worked on the Kray inquiry, and she survives him, along with Maralyn, his daughter from his first marriage.\n Leonard Ernest \u201cNipper\u201d Read, policeman, born 31 March 1925; died 7 April 2020",

The organisation is also putting staff on furlough. Clarke, who is taking a 25% pay cut, has outlined the dire consequences facing the professional game without a united response.\n\u201cFootball faces economic challenges beyond the wildest imagination of those who run it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic will be followed by its economic consequences and all business sectors will suffer.\n\u201cWe face the danger of losing clubs and leagues as finances collapse. Many communities could lose the clubs at their heart with little chance of resurrection. In the face of this unprecedented adversity, all the stakeholders within the game from players, fans, clubs, owners and administrators need to step up and share the pain to keep the game alive.\u201d\nSunderland and Crewe confirmed on Tuesday that they were putting playing and non-playing staff on furlough. Premier League Newcastle, Norwich and Bournemouth have also taken up government assistance during the crisis, with Sheffield United reported to be also considering the move, and Clarke insists top-flight clubs are also at risk in the developing financial crisis.\nHe added: \u201cEveryone should understand that the Premier League clubs are not immune from the impact of this and whilst they are impacted to different degrees depending on their cost base, the potential overall financial impact is huge.\n\u201cWe must have a plan to ensure that English football is not decimated should this season be lost and next season blighted. We hope we do not need this plan as we are all determined to finish the professional football season, however we would be fools not to develop such a contingency plan. Those that lost their clubs because English football did not rise to the challenge would rightly judge us harshly.\n\u201cTime is pressing as football burns through its cash reserves with no sign yet of a resumption of the game. Pointing fingers serves no purpose. It is time for the stakeholders to agree common cause to save our game. Contribute. Football is a team game and now is the time for teamwork.\u201d\nClarke confirmed the FA remained committed to completing the season, providing government and medical advice allows. He said: \u201cWe are committed to finishing the professional football season as this resolves the issues of promotion and relegation together with title winners on merit. However, we may not be able to finish the season as football is not our priority, human life is, and we will do as the government directs as the pandemic unfolds. Further down the football pyramid, our leagues have requested that the season is curtailed and that decision rests with the FA council.\u201d",

        "content": "Research offers \u2018a sobering warning\u2019 on the impact of today\u2019s climate emergency\nVolcanic eruptions played an important and direct role in triggering the extreme climate that killed off swathes of life at the end of the Triassic period 201m years ago, researchers have found.\nExperts say they have discovered bubbles of carbon dioxide trapped in volcanic rocks dating to the end of the Triassic, backing up the theory that such activity contributed to the greenhouse climate that is believed to have been behind the mass extinction.\n\u201cThis biotic crisis wiped out almost half of the existing species of the late Triassic in both marine and terrestrial realms,\u201d said Manfredo Capriolo of the University of Padova in Italy, a co-author of the study.\nWhile Capriolo noted the end-Triassic mass extinction has long been known to have been caused by extreme climate change, and that there was large-scale volcanic activity at the time, he said it had been unclear whether the volcanic activity directly contributed to the extinction event. Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.\nThe new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time.\nIndeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions \u2013 which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years \u2013 is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels.\nThat, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. \u201c[This] suggests that the end-Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future,\u201d the team write.\nCapriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. \u201cThe end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,\u201d he said.\nWriting in the journal Nature Communications, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province \u2013 a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon.\nThe team found around 10% of the samples showed the presences of bubbles within small blobs of magma trapped by crystals in the rocks, most of which were found to contain carbon dioxide. Further analysis, they say, suggests the gas probably became entrapped deep within the Earth\u2019s crust, suggesting it originated in the lower-middle crust or in the mantle.\nFrom these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down.\nDr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. \u201cOver the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,\u201d she said.\nThe new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. \u201cThe study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from individual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,\u201d she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects.\nThat, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. \u201cThe initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "The standup\u2019s Saturday gigs have quickly become a fixture on the online circuit \u2013 and raised \u00a320,000 for the Trussell Trust\nThe next time standup Kiri Pritchard-McLean goes on tour, she may well include a virtual gig among her UK dates. That\u2019s a sign of how revelatory her online comedy shows have proven during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus crisis.\nIt started with her assembling a lineup for a streamed gig in March to raise money for food banks, which have had a significant increase in users since the outbreak. \u201cWe thought it would attract about 30 people but we got 3,000,\u201d she says. Now, the virtual club \u2013 compered by Pritchard-McLean \u2013 has become a Saturday night fixture on the online comedy circuit.\n\u201cMy friend Jess and her brother Jake set up an online pub, the Covid Arms,\u201d explains Pritchard-McLean. As venues were temporarily shut down and social distancing measures were introduced, they wanted a place to \u201chave a drink and chat to people they were missing\u201d. Before long, they fancied a bit of entertainment in their virtual pub and asked the comic if she would do a short set. Together they decided to make it a charity gig. Joining Pritchard-McLean on the lineup were Rosie Jones, Stephen Bailey and Rachel Fairburn. There were some technical issues at first, she explains, largely because of the word Covid. \u201cYouTube thought we were a fake news channel as opposed to a load of people wanting to tell knob jokes.\u201d\nIt costs a minimum of \u00a32 to watch comedy at the Covid Arms. If you buy a \u00a310 \u201cfront row\u201d ticket, you can share your screen on Zoom and enjoy some banter with the standups. So far about \u00a320,000 has been raised for food poverty charity the Trussell Trust. \u201cWe\u2019re splitting the money between the Trussell Trust and the comedians, who are welcome to donate the money to food banks,\u201d Pritchard-McLean explains, while highlighting that comics have had \u201cmonths of their livelihoods wiped out\u201d by venue closures. \u201cNot many people can deal with that, least of all people in the gig economy. The government can\u2019t really do anything until June. So we thought maybe this is a way of giving something back to the comedy circuit.\u201d\nPritchard-McLean\u2019s standup has long had an edge of activism to it, with her previous shows about vulnerable children, abusive relationships and sexism in her industry. She relishes both the compering and the curating of the Saturday gigs, whose lineups so far have mixed established TV names such as Nish Kumar and Tom Allen with \u201cgems of the circuit\u201d including Nina Gilligan. Giving those less well-known performers a spotlight has been \u201ca beautiful thing\u201d says Pritchard-McLean, who jokes that the show is also a great excuse to have a shower and put some sequins on once a week. For the next gig, on 11 April, Mark Watson and Aisling Bea share the bill with Jonathan Major and Gavin Osborn.\nShe already knew she loved her job, says Pritchard-McLean, but she hadn\u2019t realised she would miss performing so much. The online experience may never recreate the atmosphere of a packed comedy club, where \u201cthe audience gives the show a rhythm\u201d, but Pritchard-McLean has discovered many benefits to virtual gigs, especially in accessibility. Audiences might stay away from regular clubs because of social anxiety disorder or mobility issues, she says. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re having a bad day and can\u2019t get out or they can\u2019t afford to leave the house or they don\u2019t feel safe. Online you get rid of those issues. Part of me thinks I should add a virtual date to tours.\u201d\nIf there are advantages for audiences, the same goes for comedians. Pritchard-McLean co-runs a night for new material in London called Suspiciously Cheap Comedy. Performers are paid to appear but the associated costs for anyone who lives outside the capital make it restrictive when she is booking acts. \u201cI can\u2019t really go, \u2018Do you want to come down to London for \u00a3100?\u2019 Because I know it\u2019s going to cost them that in train fares so immediately it\u2019s prohibitive.\u201d If the show is online, all you need is an internet connection. \u201cYou can book whoever you like, not who you think can afford to come to London. You can have comedians from all over the country, all different backgrounds, they can all do the gig. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nTickets are on sale until 5pm on 11 April for the next edition of Comedy at the Covid Arms.",

We all loved her and the colour of our friendship has not faded at all since then.\n\u201cBecause Nazanin opened the door for us to Iran, we love Iran. We feel emotionally attached to Iran, and we are so much concerned with whatever happened in Iran during the past 16 years. The news of Nazanin\u2019s detention was the worst news for us. Her arrest broke our hearts.\u201d\nThe specialist aid workers point out that prior to the official government aid announcement they had been privately doing their best to purchase the necessary medical equipment for Iran via their network of professional and medical equipment companies.\n\u201cIt is purely because we love all the Iranians we met during our mission, including Nazanin. We promise that we will continue to support Iran and Iranians in any way possible at any time. We are looking forward to seeing Nazanin reunited with her family and loved ones\u201d.\nJapan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has acted as an intermediary between Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, and the west over the breakdown of the nuclear deal, visiting Tehran last autumn.\nRichard Ratcliffe strikes a conciliatory note in his letter to the ambassador, writing: \u201cCoronavirus is a reminder to all of us of the commonalities beyond politics, that there are challenges that unite us all. It clearly changes priorities, and casts a new light on the political positions and actions of a number of states, and the need for cooperation as governments look to protect their peoples. I am hopeful this is an opportunity to recalibrate \u2013 in a variety of ways and disputes \u2013 what kind of a world we want going forwards.\n\u201cAmong other things, this should not be one where cases like Nazanin become normalised in disputes between Iran and the UK. That is not the world I would like our daughter Gabriella to inherit as she comes to make sense of both parts of her heritage. I hope this is a chance to move on.\u201d\nHe urges a resolution by 1 June at the latest, but adds he \u201cremains guarded that we may still be being used by the Revolutionary Guard as a new kind of bargaining chip \u2013 as leverage in the campaign to challenge US sanctions. Given the ankle tag, given the mixed messages on how hard it was to get her temporarily released, it is not clear all parts of the regime are ready to let her go.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThis week we passed four years since Nazanin\u2019s abrupt arrest. That is a long time for anyone to be held as collateral in someone else\u2019s fight, but especially for the mother of a young child. So we are determined not to let this moment settle into a new kind of bargaining chip game.\u201d",

Care workers are not being tested, even with outbreaks in their workplaces, or in some cases denied tests by NHS boards.\nGary Smith, regional organiser for GMB Scotland, said some care workers were going into work ill because they could not afford to be off work on statutory sick pay. Because people who die or fall ill with Covid-19 outside hospitals are not routinely tested for the virus, it has proven hard to verify exact numbers of cases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an utter shambles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a programme of testing. These people need to be properly valued by the government and others; caring is built on insecure and low paid workers.\u201d\nScottish Care, the sector\u2019s umbrella body, said the problem was exacerbated by very inconsistent supplies of PPE around the country and said it was essential that testing for care workers was rapidly increased.\nDonald Macaskill, its chief executive, said the army could be drafted in to provide logistical support and deliver supplies to ensure they were available around the clock.\nThe government had ordered 70 hubs to be set up around Scotland to distribute PPE but 20 of them were not yet operating; in four areas they closed at the weekend, he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t use the military\u2019s skills in a battle for life and death, then I don\u2019t know when you would use them,\u201d he said.\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the Care Inspectorate, the statutory body which regulates the sector, was in close contact with care homes. It had checked Castleview care home in Dumbarton, where eight people died from the virus, and was satisfied its infection control procedures were correct.\nThe government and the inspectorate were studying the sector to see if the support and policies were adequate, and the government had invested significant sums in securing and distributing PPE.\nSturgeon confirmed that care staff, and if necessary their family members, should be treated by the NHS as key workers and prioritised for virus testing. Jeane Freeman, the health secretary, would issue a reminder to health boards that care workers were a priority for testing.\n\u201cCare workers are doing a remarkable job in the most difficult of circumstances,\u201d she said at her daily coronavirus briefing. \u201cTesting capacity is increasing with literally every day that passes.\u201d\nShe said the army was already helping solve logistical challenges from St Andrew\u2019s House, the Scottish government\u2019s headquarters in Edinburgh, but did not directly answer a question from the BBC about whether the military should be used to deliver PPE supplies.",

Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u00a0\nIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u00a0stay at home for at least 7 days.\nIf you live with other people,\u00a0they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.\nThe Swedish Big Brother contestant Daniel Glasman left his country\u2019s edition of the show last week, having spent 50 days on the programme. When he entered the house, Covid-19 was still viewed by many as a Chinese issue, albeit with a worrying number of infections in Italy. Seven weeks later, he left his televised isolation to find a world transformed.\n\u201cI\u2019m digesting the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult because I would be in the middle of the process of dealing with being isolated, and I have to deal with the fact that the world has changed while I was gone. I can\u2019t turn my back on the world for 50 days and expect the world to keep it together, apparently. I\u2019ve had a very profound experience, but so has the world.\u201d\nThe 38-year-old communications consultant and nightclub worker, said that the limited information he and his fellow contestants had led them to underestimate the gravity of the situation: \u201cWhen we went in to isolation, we had no idea of the scale or spread of coronavirus and zero confirmed cases in Sweden. We were making jokes about the situation around corona but it was in good faith \u2013 imagining if it\u2019s all turned into a zombie movie when we leave the house.\u201d\nAs the severity of the pandemic increased, so press coverage of unaware contestants locked in regional variations of Big Brother increased, drawing comparisons with the Charlie Brooker series Dead Set where a zombie invasion affects everyone other than contestants on the show.\nAs a result, the Swedish producers decided to follow the lead of their German equivalents and provide limited information on the outbreak to participants on the programme, although Glasman said it was still a struggle to fully comprehend what was going on.\n\u201cI was in there for a total of 50 days, with very little information from the outside world. It\u2019s very hard for me to separate different days and weeks from one another when on the inside. A few weeks ago they started briefing us \u2026 they wanted to let us know that all of our love ones and family and friends were safe. They wanted to calm us down.\u201d\nThe show\u2019s live feed was briefly cut to allow contestants to ask questions of producers about what was going on in the world outside the television studio: \u201cThere was a fact-centred discussion: a lot of restaurants are closing, we\u2019re stopping huge gatherings of people, sports is stopped, air travel is restricted. Quite a lot of bullet points. We were probably the healthiest people on the planet at the time of being in the house.\u201d\nHowever, the questions were limited. \u201cWith all due respect to my fellow Big Brother participants, it\u2019s not exactly a house full of rocket scientists.\nHe said the process was handled well by the production team, who warned him: \u201cthe world you are wanting to go out into is not the world it was before\u201d.\nAlthough Big Brother is no longer made in the UK, it continues to be popular around the world \u2013 including in many countries badly affected by coronavirus. The Canadian series ended prematurely due to the lockdown, with the prize money going to coronavirus charities.\nShocked contestants were gathered together and told the show was over and they were being sent home. \u201cPart of this Big Brother game is being cut off from the real world, and it\u2019s scary because you do not know what\u2019s going on out there,\u201d said contestant Hira Deol when told by producers what was going on.\nMeanwhile the Brazilian contest continues, although some fans are running online campaigns to vote out medical workers who are on the show, in the hope they can help the fight against Covid-19.\nBoth the German and Swedish series of the show are still running, reflecting the relatively light-touch social distancing measures in those countries. As a result Glasman has been not been forced back into total isolation since going back to his normal life in Stockholm.\n\u201cWe are all doing the social distancing thing to a common sense degree, but I have been to my favourite restaurants, I have had meals out, and I\u2019ve had drinks with friends here and there, then staying isolated the rest of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s either a case of us being right or the only ones being wrong.\u201d",

        "content": "His critics allege Dr Anthony Fauci is recklessly damaging the economy and blocking supposed wonder treatments like hydroxychloroquine\nIn recent days, Donald Trump\u2019s closest conservative media allies have been pursuing an increasingly strident case against Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and a prominent part of the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 response.\nCritics close to the president have recently been alleging that Fauci is recklessly damaging the economy, preventing the use of supposed wonder treatments like hydroxychloroquine, and now, mid-pandemic, some of them appear to be calling for his job.\nThe most prominent and stinging attack on Fauci came last Friday, when the Fox News talkshow anchor Tucker Carlson devoted an entire segment to Fauci\u2019s recommendation for a sustained lockdown, calling it a recipe for \u201cnational suicide\u201d.\nCarlson accused Fauci of \u201cgetting it wrong on the coronavirus\u201d, and claimed that \u201cAnthony Fauci told us not to worry about this epidemic. Now he\u2019s demanding that the federal government quarantine the entire country.\u201d\nHe criticized his reliance on models like those produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) which had, according to him, overestimated the scale of the crisis. As a result, the economy was shut down, and the resultant mass unemployment would be \u201ca far bigger disaster than the virus itself\u201d.\nCarlson \u2013 who unlike some others in conservative media has taken the pandemic seriously for some time \u2013 had previously interviewed Fauci on his program, and until now had seemed well disposed towards him.\nBut his shifting attitude echoes the increasing criticism of Dr Fauci from other people who have been close to the president \u2013 including Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani.\nLike Carlson, Steve Bannon took the virus seriously early on \u2013 he was warning of a looming catastrophe in special episodes of his War Room broadcast from late January, when most political media was still entirely focused on impeachment and the Democratic primary.\nThe former Breitbart supremo, Trump campaign director and White House staffer, still identifies his program as speaking for \u201cthe Trump movement\u201d. His team has offered bipartisan praise of figures like Andrew Cuomo and Jay Inslee, governors of New York and Washington respectively.\nOn the other hand, he has offered very little criticism of President Trump, and from the beginning his broadcast has relentlessly worked to apportion blame for the outbreak to the Chinese Communist party.\nIn the last week, though, just as the Trump-led federal response has become mired in scandals about preferential PPE allocations, outbidding states on equipment purchases and sacking naval officers, Bannon has begun devoting entire episodes to criticism of Fauci.\nBannon and his co-hosts have insisted that Fauci release the federal government\u2019s own data and modeling, provide a fixed time period for closures, and step back from involvement in health communication on the virus. (For his part, Fauci has continued to give advice at odds with the president \u2013 on subjects like the likely duration of lockdowns and the feasibility of untested treatments.)\nAnd there\u2019s another bone of contention: the supposed wonder-cure, hydroxychloroquine.\nLast Thursday, the War Room co-host and former Trump campaign communications director, Jason Miller, criticized a pair of Fauci TV appearances, centering the complaint that he \u201cthrew cold water on the hydroxychloroquine test that everyone\u2019s been raving about, or the study from 6,000 doctors from like 37 countries \u2026 this was like water on what we thought were very positive developments\u201d.\nHydroxychloroquine is also the basis of the disagreement that the former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has with Fauci. On social media and on his New York City radio broadcast (also a podcast), Giuliani has tirelessly promoted the idea that the chemical is an efficacious treatment for Covid-19.\nHe was briefly banned from Twitter after tweeting out a quotation of a remark that the Turning Point USA leader, Charlie Kirk, had made on his radio show, claiming that hydroxychloroquine has a \u201c100% effective rate in treating Covid-19\u201d. The social media platform counted this as disinformation.\nReportedly, Trump\u2019s own, increasingly bullish enthusiasm for the drug is informed by Giuliani. He in turn picked the notion that it was cure-all up from a celebrity doctor, Mehmet Oz, who, like Trump, is a regular guest on Fox & Friends.\nOn Sunday, in a press conference, Trump once again pushed the chemical and claimed, inaccurately, that there were \u201cstrong, powerful signs\u201d of the drug\u2019s efficacy, and asked rhetorically, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d by taking it.\nBy Monday, lesser lights in conservative media were adding to what appears to be a growing momentum against the doctor.\nOn his podcast, Michael Savage called Fauci a \u201cgrandstander\u201d and \u201ca PR man, he\u2019s a showman. He\u2019s the P T Barnum of the Covid virus,\u201d who should be pushed back \u201cinto a laboratory where he belongs\u201d.\nPolitical commentators have noted that similar pile-ons have preceded the departures of James Mattis, Rex Tillerson and John Kelly from the administration. But experts say that much more would be at stake in the removal of Fauci in the middle of a public health crisis.\nAssociate professor Ben Harris-Roxas, from the centre for primary health care and equity at the University of New South Wales, is an expert on public health. He thinks that firing public health leaders during a pandemic is a recipe for disaster.\n\u201cPublic health experience is most important during epidemics. Each epidemic is different, but having experienced and respected public health experts in charge allows quicker action and more effective communication,\u201d Harris-Roxas said.\n\u201cFiring public health managers during this pandemic would meaningfully impair the effectiveness of the response,\u201d he added.\nOn hydroxychloroquine, Harris-Roxas said that \u201cthe promotion of untested treatments and cures has been a feature of almost every epidemic in history\u201d.\nHe said that this led to three potential problems. Untested treatments could harm people, cause shortages of drugs for people who need them for proven treatments, and \u201ccontribute to the infodemic \u2013 the spread of misinformation\u201d.\nShould Fauci go, there will be little impediment to the misinformation which is already exerting a powerful influence on the US federal government\u2019s health policy.",

        "content": "Organisation\u2019s evidence review shows wearing mask outside does not prevent infection\nThe World Health Organization has held off from recommending people wear face masks in public after assessing fresh evidence that suggested the items may help to contain the pandemic.\nThe WHO reviewed its position on masks in light of data from Hong Kong indicating that their widespread use in the community may have reduced the spread of coronavirus in some regions.\nBut in updated guidance published on Monday, the organisation maintained that while masks could help limit the spread of the disease, they were insufficient on their own. There was no evidence that wearing a mask in the community prevented healthy people from picking up respiratory infections including Covid-19, it said.\nProf David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chaired the WHO\u2019s scientific and technical advisory group for infectious hazards, said that unless people were working in healthcare settings, masks are \u201conly for the protection of others, not for the protection of oneself\u201d.\nThe committee acknowledged the virus can be transmitted by people who do not have symptoms, but said the virus must still spread via droplets or contaminated surfaces, which physical distancing and handwashing are intended to minimise.\nAccording to the updated advice, people with coronavirus symptoms should wear a face mask, self-isolate and seek medical advice as soon as they start to feel unwell, while those caring for them should wear a face mask when they are in the same room.\nThe WHO guidance on healthy people wearing masks in public appears to conflict with recent advice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which urged the US public to wear cloth face coverings in pharmacies, groceries and other public places where physical distancing can be hard to maintain.\nHeymann said masks could create a false sense of security that could end up putting people at greater risk. Even with the mouth and nose fully covered, the virus can still enter through the eyes.\n\u201cPeople think they are protected when they are not,\u201d he said. \u201cHealthcare workers, in addition to the masks, wear visors too, to protect the eyes.\u201d\nAnother concern is that people may contaminate themselves when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks.\nThe WHO said people who chose to wear masks in public should follow its advice to ensure they were using them safely. It said countries that recommended masks for the general population should set up studies to monitor their effectiveness.\nWilliam Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton, said governments felt under pressure to be seen to be doing something, even if it was a waste of time and valuable resources.\n\u201cCloth masks and poor quality surgical face masks will not filter fine respiratory droplets, and certainly not aerosols, which some are now claiming to be an infection risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major question that needs to be addressed is: what about protecting the eyes, a known route of entry?.\u201d\nDr Elaine Shuo Feng, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, supports the US stance on face masks and said it would be sensible for people who may have been exposed to the virus to wear face masks outdoors because of the risk of passing on the virus.\n\u201cIt would be helpful if high-risk people \u2013 elderly, people with chronic conditions \u2013 wear a face mask if they can\u2019t avoid crowed areas, because these people have the highest risk of severe outcomes such as ICU/death if infected,\u201d she said.\n The headline on this article was corrected on 7 April 2020 to more accurately reflect the WHO\u2019s findings.",

The number of Cross-Channel Eurostar journeys was now just 1% of those taken daily in 2019.\nHeaton-Harris said it showed that the public was heeding calls to stay home, and allowing space on rail and road for key workers and the flow of essential freight.\nHe said the government was working with unions to identify where there were shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline workers, and added: \u201cWe\u2019re particularly saddened about the deaths of bus drivers \u2013 these tragic losses emphasise how much we owe to everyone participating in keeping essential services functioning.\u201d\nThe Unite union said Transport for London had agreed that all buses in the capital would from Wednesday have additional safety measures to protect drivers, including fully sealed screens and nearby seats taken out of service.\nWhile most rail services have been effectively temporarily nationalised, with the government shouldering the drop in revenues, and bus firms have been promised a \u00a3400m package of assistance to cover lost fares, airlines have stepped up their calls for help.\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned that up to 25m jobs worldwide depending on air travel were at risk, including 5.6m in Europe, as they urged governments to offer more loans and tax relief. Jobs relying on air links were predominantly in countries dependent on tourism, but supply chains for high-value manufacturing were also affected, Iata said.\nVirgin Atlantic is the most prominent UK carrier that has applied for direct government aid, opening its books to the Treasury as it hopes for up to \u00a3500m in loans and credit guarantees.\nHeaton-Harris would not confirm how many airlines were in contact with the government for state aid. But he said the government was \u201cin very detailed dialogue\u201d with companies, including firms from other parts of the aviation industry such as airports and suppliers.\nHe said the government would not rule out taking a stake in airlines that had appealed for Treasury help, saying: \u201cEverything is on the table \u2026 We want to ensure this sector thrives.\u201d\nAir passengers and suppliers however have complained that they risk bearing the brunt of relief measures as Iata pushed for alterations to rules on refunds, allowing airlines to issue vouchers rather than repaying fares.\nThe consumer association Which? has accused travel agents of breaking the law by not refunding passengers, and denounced Abta, the travel association, for advising travel agents to issue credit notes instead. However, Abta has said its members face bankruptcy and are unable to return cash to holidaymakers because airlines are stalling on refunds.\nAccording to Iata, airlines have collectively already used $35bn (\u00a328bn) of their $61bn cash reserves with most fleets grounded due to the pandemic.\nAlexandre de Juniac, the director general of Iata, defended the use of vouchers: \u201cRefunding is almost an unbearable task, financially speaking \u2026 We were perfectly conscious of the difficulty for the passenger, but it was a matter of survival for us.\u201d\nEuropean governments have also agreed to defer until 2021 air traffic control fees amounting to about \u20ac1.1bn (\u00a31bn) in a bid to assist airlines, for which De Juniac said the sector was profoundly thankful.\nHowever, the move prompted Canso, which represents air traffic control businesses, to demand a rescue package for its sector, saying the decision posed a \u201csignificant financial challenge\u201d.",

Sign up now!\nThere was celebration today after Liverpool decided to furlough the idea of furloughing their employees, giving in to an outcry from fans, former players and over-opinionated media types with too many column inches to fill now there\u2019s no sport on. There has been no word yet on whether the furlough will be furloughed furlong or if it will just be a short-term outage.\nLike the virus that inspired it, it does not seem like long ago that nobody had even heard of the furlough, but having gained a foothold in the population it has swept the nation with haste. The Premier League has not been immune, with hundreds of normally-productive employees at Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich now in isolation away from their clubs. Liverpool\u2019s fans were the first to successfully fight off the infection, discovering that it is possible to combat even aggressive cases of furlough using the commonly-available medicine of public outrage.\n\u201cWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week, and are truly sorry for that,\u201d said Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, Peter Moore, in an open letter to fans. The Reds will thus continue to pay their employees using the cash bloating their own bank accounts, while other owners of top-flight clubs have concluded that they would do anything (furlough), but they won\u2019t do that.\nTottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust is continuing to apply a similar remedy to their own club\u2019s case of furlough, nearly a week after it exhibited its first symptoms despite pre-tax profits in the year to 30 June 2018 at a wild \u00a3138.9m. \u201cWe have been saying consistently \u2013 pause and rethink,\u201d they said on Twitter. \u201cWe are now saying it clearly and in public \u2013 do not further damage the club\u2019s reputation, listen to your fans.\u201d Former Spurs striker Gary Lineker also took to social media in an attempted to resuscitate the club\u2019s moral compass, but so far it remains unresponsive. It remains to be seen whether they and other wealthy clubs infected with furlough suffer long-term side-effects, should potential customers decide to impose some financial self-isolation upon them by steering well clear as a result.\nJoin Scott Murray for retro minute-by-minute coverage of Crystal Palace v Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final from midday on Wednesday, while Rob Smyth will also be on retro duty later that afternoon for the other semi-final between Oldham and Manchester United.

Please write back if you can.\u201d\nRon \u201cat number 24\u201d, aged 93, said he was so pleased to receive the message, and had placed the drawing in his window. \u201cLike you I am in isolation so it was so nice to hear of your concern for me,\u201d he wrote back.\n\u201cI was the first person to move into the crescent in 1955 and I have been here ever since.

        "content": "SBS On Demand is streaming more than 10 hours of his features. Our isolated film critic took the bait and watched them all\nMany terrible things are discussed in the maelstrom of mayhem and misery I call my inbox \u2013 terrible, terrible things, such as requests involving me needing to go somewhere, or speak to someone or do something.\nBut last Thursday afternoon a lovely email broke through like a ray of sunshine piercing grey clouds on a stormy day. It was an email from a publicist at SBS. The subject line read: \u201cBinge 627 minutes of ADAM DRIVER for free.\u201d\nWhy yes, I thought, I do have a lot spare time this weekend. Why yes, I do quite like Driver. Why yes, I am partial to free stuff. And why yes, I have experienced acts of cinematic self-flagellation before, being a survivor of a 14-hour Nicolas Cage marathon. I emerged from that believing Cage to be among the greatest actors in the history of cinema.\nWould an Adam Driver fest have the same effect on me? It had to find out. So I devoted my weekend to it, limiting my viewing selection to the catalogue on SBS on Demand and allowing no more than a 48-hour window to gorge on the aforementioned 627 minutes. The first movie on the bill, which I began on Saturday morning, was Noah Baumbach\u2019s 2012 hipstery dramedy Frances Ha \u2013 presented in lived-in, earthy monochrome, because STYLE.\nAnybody who has seen this film knows it\u2019s not Driver\u2019s movie. The star of the show is an almost unnaturally likable Greta Gerwig, who plays the titular New Yorker: a free thinker coasting between apartments and living circumstances. At one point Frances moves in with Driver\u2019s character, Lev, a cool cat who wears nice shirts and retro hats. In one scene he bids goodbye by saying, \u201cCatch you on the flip side.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say it ironically yet he still seems cool. How does he do that?\nNext on the itinerary was the 2013 Australian drama Tracks. This film is also driven by a strong female performance, with Mia Wasikowska playing Robyn Davidson, a woman who in 1977 did something that made me feeling especially self-conscious about the goal I had set for myself: she walked 2,700-odd kilometres across desert Australia with her four camels and her dog.\nDriver plays Rick Smolan, a US photographer for National Geographic who documents Davidson\u2019s journey and is her sort-of love interest. The director, John Curran, pursues a non-cheesy approach to their relationship. They hook up and care for each other but they aren\u2019t soulmates. This isn\u2019t some soppy romance where the lead characters make out in an airport at the end.\nWhen Tracks finished (and because the film is Australian, the dog of course dies) I was conscious that here I was, watching an Adam Driver fest \u2013 and neither of the two films so far was really \u201chis\u201d. Not so for the third on the billing: Jim Jarmusch\u2019s soft-edged character drama Paterson, which is very much a Driver film. He even plays a character whose profession is the same word as his surname. Driver is Paterson, a New Jersey bus driver and part-time poet who lovingly labours over lines he scribbles on to a notebook, which slowly fills up.\nJarmusch gives the film a beautiful, repetitive structure, melodically cutting between Paterson driving the bus, checking his mailbox, drinking at his local watering hole, and of course writing poems \u2013 which are displayed in text draped across the screen. Driver\u2019s performance is understated and charming. You can\u2019t imagine the character being played by anybody else.\nI did not watch any Driver movies on Saturday evening \u2013 taking a break from the terribly onerous duties befalling the heroic, hardworking critic. Sunday morning was, I figured, a fitting time to watch Silence, Martin Scorsese\u2019s hard-hitting 161-minute drama about Jesuit priests (one of them played by Driver) trying to track down Liam Neeson, who is hiding somewhere in the mountains of Japan.\nDriver appears early on, alongside Andrew Garfield as a fellow priest, and boy does he look gaunt (the actor reportedly lost up to 40 pounds \u2013 or 18kg \u2013 for the role). Only 15 minutes in, Driver is already hiding in a cave and cowering in fear, suggesting this will not be a pleasant Sunday school experience, with picture books and the singing of He\u2019s Got the Whole World in his Hands. Indeed, terrible things await \u2013 including torture, death and long dialogue exchanges with Neeson.\nMy spirits rallied during the final leg of the journey, watching Terry Gilliam\u2019s 2018 meta fantasy-adventure The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. It presents a very different Driver. He plays a conceited, obnoxious, philandering film director \u2013 of course a realistic depiction of of film directors, but quite a shock coming from Driver. He seemed like such a nice young man, with his poems and his photography and his \u201ccatch you on the flip side\u201d.\nSo, did I come out of my weekend with Driver falling for him as much as I fell for Cage? I cannot say that I did. Watching Cage for 14 hours felt like being strapped to a chair and pelted with the craft of acting. Watching Driver for 10 felt more like hanging out with a cool, relaxed guy who talked about culture and wore sunglasses inside. Yet maybe, given the intense state of the world right now, I chose the right company.\n SBS On Demand is streaming all of these films right now",

        "content": "Japan to rely on peer pressure for enforcement; China declares no new fatalities and lifts Wuhan lockdown\nEurope has passed the grim milestone of 50,000 Covid-19 deaths and Japan has declared a state of emergency to curb the virus\u2019s spread, as China declared no new fatalities for the first time since January and lifted the 11-week lockdown of Wuhan.\nWhile Denmark and Norway announced plans to lift some of their physical distancing measures on Tuesday, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, declared a month-long state of emergency in major population centres, including Tokyo, where the number of cases has more than doubled this week to 1,116.\nThe measure gives Japanese governors the authority to urge people to stay at home and businesses to close or shorten their opening hours. Unlike many other countries, there are no punishments for those who defy the request and enforcement will rely largely on peer pressure and respect for authority.\nIn Wuhan, where the coronavirus began, authorities allowed residents to leave the city for the first time since 23 January when 11 million people were put under lockdown to contain the quickly spreading disease.\nBut dampening talk of an imminent relaxation of restrictions across Europe, meanwhile, the total number of coronavirus deaths on the continent passed 50,000, with several big countries including France, Italy and Spain reporting high daily death rates. Most, though, were attributed to delays in counting over the weekend, and new infection numbers continue to fall.\nSpain, which has the second highest number of deaths from Covid-19 after Italy, said its total had reached 13,798. But the number of confirmed cases rose by only 4% to 140,510, and the country was \u201ccontinuing to see a downward trend\u201d, said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra, of the health ministry\u2019s emergency coordination unit.\nWhile another 604 deaths were reported in Italy on Tuesday, the country also recorded the lowest day-to-day increase in new cases since it entered lockdown, with the number of new infections rising by just 0.9%. More than 135,500 Italians have been infected by the virus and 17,127 have died.\nGermany\u2019s confirmed infections rose by 3,834 to 99,225, a slightly faster rate of increase after four consecutive days of falls. Lothar Wieler, the head of Germany\u2019s public health body the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said it was too early to think of lifting distancing measures.\nThere was different news in Scandinavia, however, where Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, announced that daycare facilities and primary schools could reopen from 20 April, with hair salons and other services to follow later in the month. Concerts and sports events will remain banned until mid-June, Solberg said.\nHer counterpart in Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, made a similar announcement, saying nurseries and primary schools will reopen from 15 April \u201con condition everyone keeps their distance and washes their hands\u201d.\nBars, restaurants, nightclubs, shopping centres, hairdressers and massage parlours will remain closed, however, and gatherings of more than 10 people are still prohibited. \u201cDaily life is not going to return as before for the moment. We will live with many restrictions for many more months,\u201d Frederiksen warned.\nIn the US, New York state recorded its highest single-day death toll of 731, bringing its total to 5,489, according to the governor, Andrew Cuomo. In New York City, more people have now died from the coronavirus \u2013 at least 3,202 \u2013 than were killed in the city by the 9/11 attacks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s 731 people who we lost,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBehind every one of those numbers is an individual. There\u2019s a family, there\u2019s a mother, there\u2019s a father, there\u2019s a sister, there\u2019s a brother. So a lot of pain again today for many New Yorkers.\u201d\nNew memos revealed Donald Trump was warned by a White House adviser in late January and again in late February that an unchecked Covid-19 outbreak could cause between 500,000 and 1.2 million US deaths. Trump has frequently said nobody could predict the severity of the disease, which has so far killed nearly 11,000 Americans.\nAs the scale of the economic fallout continued to grow, the UN\u2019s International Labour Organisation said in a study that the livelihoods of up to 1.25 billion workers were threatened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it was the \u201cworst global crisis\u201d since the second world war.\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, coronavirus has infected 1.38 million people around the world, killing more than 78,000. About 4 billion people are living in some form of mandatory or recommended confinement and the global economy is on hold.\nAmong other developments:\nSpain aims to accelerate plans to introduce universal basic income after 302,265 people signed on as unemployed last month.\nThe number of confirmed new cases in the Netherlands rose by 777 to 19,580, continuing a slowing trend in the rate of increase.\nFinland announced tougher border controls to further reduce arrivals from Sweden, where measures are less strict and the infection rate is higher.\nUkraine made wearing face masks mandatory in public, and several French towns and cities announced plans to do so when confinement rules are lifted.\nTen newborn babies tested positive for the virus on a maternity ward in Romania, amid suspicions they contracted it from staff.\nParis banned outdoor exercise between 10am and 7pm as too many residents ventured out in warm and sunny weather.\nThe Pakistani military promised that dozens of doctors who were briefly jailed after protesting at a lack of protective equipment would get what they need.\nMeanwhile on Tuesday, China announced no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since it started publishing figures in January.\nThe announcements came amid widespread suspicion, denied by Beijing, that the ruling Communist government may be intentionally under-reporting the real number of deaths and infections.\nChina had 32 new infections on Monday, against 39 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, and for the first time since the country began publishing national data in late January, Wuhan recorded no new deaths, joining the rest of mainland China, which has recorded none since 31 March.",

Last week, Patel announced a free-of-charge one-year extension for 2,800 foreign doctors, nurses and paramedics, whose visas are due to expire by 1 October. But the cross-party group, which includes one Conservative MP, Daniel Poulter, argue it does not go far enough.\nJardine said: \u201cThousands of the doctors, nurses and support staff who work in our NHS \u2013 the people on the frontline of this crisis \u2013 are foreign nationals. Our beloved NHS could not function and lives would be lost at this difficult time without their contribution.\n\u201cRight across the UK we have seen people\u2019s enormous pride in the NHS and goodwill towards NHS staff. Now the government has a chance to show its own support for the people\u2019s heroes by extending the right to remain to all the foreign national NHS workers fighting for our lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cIf someone is prepared to risk their life for this country, they must be allowed to live in it. This is not just a gesture \u2013 it is our moral responsibility.\u201d\nOther signatories to the letter include the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and the former Labour leadership contender Jess Phillips.\nThe extent to which the NHS relies on migrants was underlined by the fact that the first four doctors who died from coronavirus were all born overseas. Dr Alfa Saadu, 68, Amged el-Hawrani, 55, Adil El Tayar, 64 and GP Dr Habib Zaidi, 76, had ancestry in regions including Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nBefore lifting its cap in 2018, the government was criticised for the refusal of visas to thousands of doctors from outside the European Economic Area, despite staff shortages in hospitals.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise and value the huge contribution which foreign NHS workers are making at this difficult time.\n\u201cThat is why we announced an automatic 12-month, free of charge, visa extension for NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics whose visa will expire before October, to ease the situation for them.\n\u201cWe are continuing to see how else we can further assist frontline NHS workers during this crisis.\u201d",

        "content": "Donald Trump was warned at the end of January by one of his top White House advisers that coronavirus had the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans and derail the US economy, unless tough action were taken immediately, new memos have revealed.\nThe memos were written by Trump\u2019s economic adviser, Peter Navarro, and circulated via the National Security Council widely around the White House and federal agencies.\nThey show that even within the Trump administration alarm bells were ringing by late January, at a time when the president was consistently downplaying the threat of Covid-19.\nAccording to figures from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, by Tuesday more than 368,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US and more than 11,000 people had died. New York is the hardest-hit state: on Tuesday the governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the death toll was nearly 5,500, after the biggest single-day increase.\nMore than 1,000 have died in New Jersey and more than 700 in Michigan. California and Louisiana are also leading hotspots.\nAs Cuomo spoke, and as reports about the Navarro memos dominated media coverage, Trump tweeted angrily.\nThe president complained about the World Health Organization and a report by a federal health department watchdog which details serious problems faced by US hospitals dealing with the pandemic.\n\u201cThe WHO really blew it,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cFor some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?\u201d\nThe WHO has cautioned against travel bans, saying they are not effective and can be counterproductive. In January, two days after the first Navarro memo, Trump placed restrictions on travel from China but did not totally close it down, as he has repeatedly claimed. The president\u2019s complaint on Tuesday was resonant of attacks on other international bodies including Nato and the World Trade Organization.\nTrump also attacked the office of the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services at his White House briefing on Monday.\nOn Twitter on Tuesday, he asked: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the IG, who spent [eight] years with the Obama administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, VP & others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!\u201d\nThe official in question, Christi Grimm, is principal deputy inspector general and has worked for the health department since 1999, serving under Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump.\nTrump has regularly attacked Obama for his handling of public health matters including the outbreak of H1N1, or swine flu, in 2009. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 12,500 Americans died in that episode.\nTrump\u2019s reference to a \u201cfake dossier\u201d echoed his complaints about political opposition research work carried out by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, and subsequently at the heart of the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.\nTrump fired the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, on Friday night, over his role in sending to Congress a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s approaches to Ukraine which led to the president\u2019s impeachment.\nThe Navarro memos, first reported by the New York Times and Axios, were written by Navarro on 29 January and 23 February. The first memo, composed on the day Trump set up a White House coronavirus task force, gave a worst-case scenario of the virus killing more than half a million Americans.\nAccording to the Times, it said: \u201cThe lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on US soil. This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d\nThe second memo went even further, predicting that a Covid-19 pandemic, left unchecked, could kill 1.2 million Americans and infect as many as 100 million.\nThis was not the first time Trump and his White House team were warned that the virus had the potential to devastate the US and needed to be dealt with quickly and firmly.\nSenior scientists, epidemiologists and health emergency experts in the US and around the world delivered that clear message early on in the crisis, only for Trump to continue belittling the scale of the threat which he compared falsely to the dangers of seasonal flu.\nBut the emergence of the memos from such a senior aide within the White House will make it much more difficult for Trump to claim \u2013 as he has done on multiple occasions \u2013 that nobody was able to predict the severity of the disease.\nAs the pandemic has swept across the country, the president has come under mounting criticism for having done too little, too late in response, leading to mass shortages of diagnostic testing, protective gear for frontline health workers and ventilators for the very sick.",

        "content": "Shares have bounced back but it\u2019s too soon to call the bottom for prices in the Covid-19 pandemic\nHave we seen the bottom for stock markets? It is tempting to believe so after two days of fast action as investors have responded to the welcome sight of flatter coronavirus curves in Italy, Spain and Germany.\nSome of the gains in individual stocks \u2013 those that had fallen the furthest \u2013 have been stunning. Speedy boarders could have made a 27% return in 48 hours by buying shares in easyJet first thing on Monday morning. In the same short period, Rolls-Royce, the engine-maker, gained 24%. Like easyJet, it was able to unveil a self-help strategy involving more borrowing.\nOr try Carnival, the cruise ship company that seemed marooned and friendless at the end of last week: up 25% on Monday\u2019s opening price and 43% on Friday\u2019s closing level after raising fresh funding. Asos, the online fashion retailer, joined the club on Tuesday by saying it is close to raising more equity and debt.\nWhat does it all mean? Very little, probably. There is a fear of missing the bounce in over-sold stocks, but it would be unwise to draw wider morals. Central banks and governments have made financing conditions easier \u2013 a big achievement \u2013 but the shape of the post-lockdown recovery remains anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe V-shaped camp has adherents, but they are dwindling in number. The \u201ccorrugated\u201d thesis \u2013 brief surges and relapses \u2013 is gaining ground, which would make sense if lockdowns are rolled back and then partially reimposed if fresh viral outbreaks occur. Take your pick.\nHistory, though, says it\u2019s far too soon to call the bottom for share prices, at least according to Bank of America\u2019s analysts. They think it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d since 1929 if the S&P 500, the main US index, \u201cfailed to re-test or even fall below\u201d its low point on 23 March if recession arrives. Their point is that bear markets in stocks, when accompanied by recession on the ground, tend to last a while \u2013 about 11 months on average.\nThis time may be different, not least because most recessions aren\u2019t caused by pandemics, but the current stock market still feels essentially directionless. The FTSE 100 has gained 5.3% in two days as global investors have focused on lower infection rates in many countries. That news is encouraging, but the jobless numbers are still horrendous and are likely to get worse. This mini-rally for share prices feels fragile.\nA dose of dividend realism has arrived at Cineworld, where the board has finally understood that distributing cash to shareholders is not a smart idea when you\u2019re carrying debts of $3.5bn and the doors of all your 787 cinemas in 10 countries are shut.\nMooky Greidinger, Cineworld\u2019s acquisition-hungry boss, was wedded to the divi three weeks ago. Since he and his family own 20% of the company, one could understand the desire for income. But the stance was obviously nonsensical. A final quarterly divi for 2019 worth $58m may be peanuts, or popcorn, in the context of the debt pile, but lenders prefer borrowers to be serious.\nThe $58m distribution has now been suspended, along with dividends for 2020 as Cineworld starts talking to banks about securing liquidity. For good measure, Mooky\u2019s crew are donning hair shirts, relatively speaking, by deferring salaries and bonuses until the screen comes into focus.\nOne can see how Cineworld, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, could muddle through. Half its costs in a normal year are royalty payments to film studios; if no films are showing, there\u2019s no payment. The company can also make use of governments\u2019 furlough schemes and beg landlords to defer rents.\nYet Cineworld must also find a way to abandon its planned $2.1bn purchase of the Canadian chain Cineplex, a cash deal agreed before coronavirus and due to be funded entirely with debt.\nThe good news, of a sort, is that Cineplex\u2019s share price sits at one-third of the supposed takeover price, suggesting the Toronto market thinks the deal is dead. But Cineworld still needs to get itself formally off the hook: wriggle and squirm if needs be.\nAfter that, Greidinger needs to tame his debt-fuelled takeover ways permanently. Cineworld\u2019s share price, up on Tuesday but down 70% this year, says that game is over.",

Apparently not, if you\u2019re a former Hollywood power couple\nNames: Demi Moore and Bruce Willis.\nAges: Bruce is 65, Demi 57.\nAppearance: A symbol of togetherness, in matching green-striped pyjamas.\nBut I thought they were divorced. This is Hollywood. Divorce is a relative term.\nYes, it means they are no longer relatives. Don\u2019t be silly: in Los Angeles, divorce is just the start of a beautiful relationship.I have no idea what you\u2019re on about. That\u2019s because you have your head stuck in a book and have not been studying Bruce and Demi\u2019s grown-up daughter Tallulah\u2019s Instagram account.You\u2019re so right. I\u2019m finding Tolstoy a great comfort during the lockdown. Well, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve missed a fantastic picture posted by Tallulah showing her mum and dad embracing while giving a thumbs-up as they quarantine together. Isn\u2019t that a bit weird? Look, it may seem weird to you, sitting at home eating beans on toast and reading Tolstoy in your flat in Cheam, but Hollywood A-listers do things differently. Why shouldn\u2019t Bruce, Demi, their three daughters, two of the daughters\u2019 boyfriends, some unidentified bloke and lots of Demi\u2019s small dogs isolate en masse and post pictures on social media of them all wearing fetching pyjamas? Even the dogs! No reason. It\u2019s just I thought they had been divorced for years. They divorced in 2000; Willis married the model Emma Heming in 2009. Willis and Heming have two daughters together.\nIs Heming also seen in her pyjamas? Strangely enough, no, but she is unconcerned about her husband quarantining with his ex-wife, responding to the picture with the comment: \u201cNot many can pull that color off! Lookin good squad.\u201dDo Moore and Heming get on well? Like sisters, apparently. Moore attended Willis and Heming\u2019s wedding, and was there again when they renewed their vows in 2019. She\u2019s clearly good at not harbouring a grudge. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to say, but I\u2019m very proud of our divorce,\u201d Moore wrote last year in her bestselling memoir, Inside Out. What are they doing in their mass isolation? Moore has had a few issues in the past with substance abuse, and that put a strain on her relationship with her daughters. That\u2019s over now and this is a great opportunity to continue their renewed relationship. Moore once revealed to the New York Times that she and her daughters are very into \u201cspiritual psychology\u201d and \u201csoul-centred living\u201d.\nBeats Scrabble, I suppose. What a very Cheam remark.\nDo say: \u201cWhat a wonderfully heartwarming story in these dark times.\u201d\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cYou don\u2019t think they did it just to sell the fancy pyjamas, do you?\u201d",

There are now 2,095 dollar billionaires in the world \u2013 and a record 1,062 of them have lost money compared with last year.\nAmong those who joined the billionaires\u2019 club is Eric Yuan, the founder of Silicon Valley video conferencing app Zoom. The magazine estimates that Yuan, who owns 20% of Zoom\u2019s shares, has a paper fortune of $5.5bn.\nThe app has become hugely popular during the coronavirus lockdown as people around the world use it to keep in touch. Zoom has been used for everything from nursery school sing-alongs to FTSE 100 boardroom meertings and even UK Cabinet meetings.\nBut Yuan was forced to apologise to users over misleading claims that it offers \u201cend-to-end encryption for all meetings\u201d. \u201cWe recognise that we have fallen short of the community\u2019s \u2013 and our own \u2013 privacy and security expectations,\u201d Yuan said in a blog post. \u201cFor that, I am deeply sorry.\u201d\nAmazon founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, maintained his standing as the world\u2019s richest person for the third consecutive year with a $113bn fortune. His total wealth estimated by Forbes slipped from $131bn last year. Amazon\u2019s shares have largely recovered from the stock market plunge as most of the company\u2019s services are still operating throughout the lockdown.\nMost of Trump\u2019s wealth comes from his real estate. His Trump Organization empire \u2013 which is managed by his sons Donald Jr and Eric \u2013 includes Trump Tower in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which the president likes to call his \u201cwinter White House\u201d). There are also more than a dozen hotels and golf courses, such as the Trump International Hotel above the Las Vegas strip and the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nWorld governments and many US states have forced the closure of all non-essential businesses across the world, leaving offices and hotels empty and golf courses deserted.\nThe Trump Organization has closed 17 of its properties across the world, according to the Washington Post. Those that are still open are running skeleton services. About 1,500 Trump Organization staff have been laid off or furloughed, according to public filings reviewed by the newspaper.\nThe closed properties generated about $650,000-a-day for the company, according to the president\u2019s previous financial disclosures.\nThe Trump Organization last week sought guidance from Florida\u2019s Palm Beach county about whether it expected the company to continue making monthly payments on land it leases for a 27-hole golf club, the New York Times reported. Trump representatives have also reached out to Deutsche Bank, the company\u2019s largest creditor, about the possibility of postponing payments on some of its loans.\nForbes said it calculated Trump\u2019s fortune by comparing it to the share price plunges experienced by stock market-listed real estate companies, which suffered average stock price declines of 37%. The magazine also compared Trump\u2019s hotel and golf businesses with listed hospitality companies, which have also suffered heavily in the stock market rout.\nTrump also owns 125,000 sq ft of retail space near Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It is normally one of the most profitable shopping areas in the world, but has been deserted for weeks due to the pandemic.\nEric Anton, a New York property broker, said: \u201cThe [Forbes] analysis, it\u2019s as good as any other way I can think of [estimating Trump\u2019s wealth].\u201d\n This article was amended on 17 April 2020 to describe the location of the Trump International Hotel as \u201cabove the Las Vegas strip\u201d rather than on the strip.",

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nWhitty had interjected after the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, gave a more circumspect reply, saying: \u201cThe German curve looks as though it\u2019s lower at the moment, and that is important, and I don\u2019t have a clear answer to exactly what is the reason for that.\u201d\nVallance added that when comparing the experiences of two countries in tackling the virus, it was important to look at the differences between their societies. \u201cThere are things to do with demographics, there are things to do with the way systems are organised, and of course there may be differences in the way certain responses have been taken. And we don\u2019t know, but we are in regular contact,\u201d he said.\nThe two experts were speaking at Tuesday\u2019s Downing Street briefing. Whitty has been absent from the frontline for several days after developing coronavirus symptoms.\nHis answer appeared to contradict ministers\u2019 insistence that they had done everything they could to speed up the number of checks taking place.\nWidespread testing is regarded by many experts as a precondition for lifting the UK lockdown, which Vallance said on Tuesday appeared to be helping to control the spread of the disease.\nThe former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly challenged his successor over whether the government is testing widely enough; and the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has also pressed the issue, despite being generally supportive of the government\u2019s approach.\nThere has been particular concern about the lack of availability of tests for NHS staff. Announcing the latest figures on Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said a total of 213,181 people had now been tested for Covid-19, of whom 55,242 had tested positive.\nHancock conceded last week that the UK was having to build up a diagnostics industry almost from scratch, and highlighted what he called the \u201cfive pillars\u201d of the government\u2019s approach.\nThese included the creation of new \u201csuper-labs\u201d and the involvement of private labs around the country. He admitted that the government had \u201ca huge amount of work to do\u201d.\nThe government took a decision when it announced the shift from \u201ccontaining\u201d the virus to \u201csuppressing\u201d it, saying it would no longer seek to isolate individual cases but instead would only test hospital patients.\nThe 100,000-a-day target has been thrown into doubt in recent days by the fact that several potential antibody tests \u2013 to determine whether people have contracted the virus in the past \u2013 have so far failed to prove effective.\nThe government ordered 17.5m such tests from several manufacturers in the hope they would prove to be what Boris Johnson called a \u201cgame changer\u201d \u2013 but Hancock said on Sunday they were not yet good enough to use, and experts said a successful test could be a month away.\nHancock had previously suggested the government was looking at the idea of so-called immunity passports that could allow people proven to have had the virus to return to a more normal life sooner than others.\nWhitty was also asked about the risks of the disease to residents in nursing homes and care homes, and he said they were likely to face some of the biggest challenges in the weeks ahead, and he would expect the death rate in such homes to rise.",

I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.\u201d\nAccording to several reports on Tuesday, Modly was told to apologise by the defence secretary, Mark Esper.\nModly sparked a leadership crisis at the Pentagon when an audio recording surfaced of a speech he gave to the crew of the aircraft carrier, in which he denigrated the commander he had fired for having circulated a memo calling for more help for his crew, who had been stricken by a coronavirus outbreak onboard.\nThe acting navy secretary\u2019s apology came soon after Donald Trump said on Monday evening he would intervene in the situation, and hinted he might reinstate the former Roosevelt commander Captain Brett Crozier.\n\u201cHis career prior to that was very good. So I\u2019m going to get involved and see exactly what\u2019s going on there because I don\u2019t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day,\u201d Trump said, while stressing that Crozier should not have circulated the memo.\nReferring to Modly and Crozier, the president added: \u201cTwo good people \u2026 they were arguing. And I\u2019m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments \u2026 So I may look into it in great detail. And I\u2019ll be able to figure it out very fast.\u201d\nIn the recording of Modly\u2019s speech on board the Roosevelt, published by the Task & Purpose military news website, heckling can be heard from the crew during the speech, which was otherwise greeted with silence.\nModly justified his decision to relieve Capt Crozier of command last week, on the grounds that his four-page memo requesting more help for his crew, and asking for them to be moved on shore at Guam, had been circulated to more than 40 people. It was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, but Modly did not accuse Crozier of the leak.\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t think that information was going to get out into the public in this information age that we live in, then he was too naive or too stupid to be the commanding officer of a ship like this,\u201d Modly said.\nIn his apology on Monday night, Modly said: \u201cI believe, precisely because he is not naive or stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship.\u201d\nDuring Mody\u2019s speech on Sunday, someone (presumably a crew member) can be heard yelling \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Crozier was a popular captain and video circulated on Friday of the crew massing on the deck of the Roosevelt to cheer and chant the captain\u2019s name as he left the ship, walking down the gangplank to a waiting car.\nModly criticised the crew for cheering, saying that they should think of the people of Guam, who were concerned about being infected by sick sailors brought ashore. He attacked the media, which he said were seeking to embarrass the navy, and accused Crozier of betrayal.\n\u201cIt was a betrayal of trust with [sic] me, with his chain of command, with you, with the 800 to 1,000 people who are your shipmates on shore right now busting their asses every day to do what they need to do to \u2026 to get you guys off here, get you safe, get you healthy, get you clean,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s scared about this thing. But I tell you something \u2013 if this ship was in combat and there were hypersonic missiles coming at it, you\u2019d be pretty fucking scared too,\u201d he said, to a shout of \u201cWhoa!\u201d from the crew. \u201cBut you do your jobs.\u201d\nSo far, according to the Pentagon, 61% of the Roosevelt crew has been tested for Covid-19, and 173 members have tested positive. Two thousand sailors, just under half the crew, have been moved ashore on Guam, though none have been hospitalised as yet.\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress and an independent, Justin Amash, called for Modly\u2019s immediate resignation.\nOne of them, Adam Smith, the chair of the House armed services committee, said Modly was a competent and experienced official who appeared to have gone too far in trying to emulate and impress Trump.\n\u201cActing Secretary Modly is going to have a heck of a time getting the confidence in the navy back, given that he made that speech,\u201d Smith told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWhy would a competent capable veteran with extensive experience and leadership skills make such an obvious mistake? I think it\u2019s because everyone over there is trying to figure out how do I stay in the good graces of the tyrant across the water.\u201d\nAfter the recording of his speech was published, Modly initially issued a defiant statement saying he had not listened to the recording but that \u201cthe spoken words were from the heart\u201d.\n\u201cI stand by every word I said, even, regrettably any profanity that may have been used for emphasis,\u201d he said.\nModly became acting secretary in November after the former navy secretary Richard Spencer was fired for dissenting from Trump\u2019s attempt to exonerate a Navy Seal, Eddie Gallagher, who had been accused of war crimes and was demoted after being found guilty of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter.\n This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version misspelled Justin Amash as Justin Lamash.

        "content": "Research indicates virus has disproportionate impact on non-white critically ill patients\nEarly research into the first patients critically ill with Covid-19 in UK hospitals indicates that black and Asian people are more likely to be badly affected by coronavirus than white people.\nThe Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre found that 35% of almost 2,000 patients were non-white, nearly triple the 13% proportion in the UK population as a whole.\nFourteen per cent of those with the most serious cases were Asian and the same proportion were black, according to the study, which has triggered calls for further research to understand why the virus appears to be having a disproportionate impact on non-white ethnic groups.\nThe study is thought to be the first analysis of its kind anywhere in the world looking at the ethnic breakdown of cases of the virus. On Tuesday the confirmed number of deaths in NHS services among people with a confirmed case of the virus rose to 6,159 people, with more who died at home, in hospices and in care settings yet to be counted.\nThe study examined admissions to a sample of 286 critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with confirmed Covid-19 up until noon on 3 April. It also showed the median age of those in a critical condition of all ethnicities was 61 and that almost three quarters were men.\nThe patients most likely to survive in intensive care were those between 16 and 49, 76% of whom were discharged. The number fell to 50% for those aged 50 to 69, and to 32% for those aged 70 and over.\n\u201cThis is a signal and it needs to be looked at more carefully,\u201d said Kamlesh Khunti, professor in primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, who studies health trends in black and minority ethnic populations. \u201cFor example, South Asians live in more deprived areas and have more cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\u201d\nHe added South Asian people often lived in larger, multi-generational households and so \u201csocial isolation may not be as prevalent\u201d.\nGovernment figures confirm that cramped housing is far more likely to be a problem for ethnic minorities. Thirty per cent of the UK Bangladeshi population are considered to live in overcrowded housing compared with 2% among the white British population. Fifteen per cent of black African people also live in overcrowded conditions, as do 16% of Pakistanis.\n\u201cWe need to ensure that every individual, including the BAME population, are following social distancing instructions,\u201d Khunti said. \u201cWe have anecdotal information that it might not be happening in certain BAME groups.\u201d\nOther socio-economic factors could be at play too. NHS staff, who are particularly exposed to coronavirus, are disproportionately drawn from ethnic minorities.\nIn London more than a quarter of transport workers operating tubes and buses, which have remained open during the lockdown, are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.",

But even for such an organisation, predicting what will happen to us all as a result of Covid-19 is a tricky business.\nCrucially, modelling or any other analysis depends on the data that can be gathered. Inevitably, the IHME has better data for the likely outcomes of Covid-19 in Italy and Spain, where the epidemics have peaked, than for the UK, its director, Dr Christopher Murray, says.\nThe margins for the organisation\u2019s predictions of daily deaths in the UK are big \u2013 a tenfold variation from 800 to 8,000 near the peak which, it predicts, will happen around 17 April.\nThe IHME will be inputting new data on deaths, which it says are a better indicator of what is going on every day than are cases. That means the margins will shrink and the predictions become firmer as time goes on.\nThis is a different type of model from that of the Imperial College London group advising the government, because it will constantly evolve. But even the Imperial modellers had to change their predictions some weeks ago. Famously, their changed advice persuaded the government to bring in physical distancing guidance, with towns closed for business and people staying home to reduce what, it had suddenly become apparent, would be an unacceptably high death toll.\nOne moment the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was asking people with symptoms to stay home for seven days; a few days later, he had ordered a lockdown. What changed was data from Italy\u2019s experience of the pandemic, in which more people were critically ill than anticipated, and from the NHS about its inability to cope if the same should happen in the UK.\nModels are only as good as the data that goes into them. As time goes on, we will learn a lot more about the outcomes of this pandemic in countries around the world and the effectiveness of policies in mitigating the worst outcomes.",

Plus, the unlikely coronavirus pen pals\nGood morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 8 April.\nQantas staff are \u201cincredibly fearful\u201d about flights to rescue Australians trapped overseas, forcing the airline to turn to its staff in New Zealand after it failed to get enough Australian cabin crew to volunteer. With news that 50 Qantas and Jetstar staff have contracted coronavirus there has been growing anxiety among Qantas staff about plans to resume flights to Los Angeles, London, Auckland and Hong Kong this week. The government has released modelling showing the strain that would be placed on the Australian health system without strict lockdown procedures. Some 35,000 intensive care beds could be required at the pandemic\u2019s peak \u2013 well beyond capacity. The government also confirmed that Covid-19 patients would be given the controversial anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine outside of clinical trials. Donald Trump has touted the drug as a cure or preventative for Covid-19 but scientists have warned it can cause severe and even life-threatening side-effects.\nBoris Johnson remains in a stable condition in intensive care and is not on a ventilator. The UK\u2019s stand-in prime minister, Dominic Raab, told reporters he thought Johnson would pull through because he is a fighter. In the same media conference, Raab suggested the UK\u2019s lockdown would be extended, saying the country was not yet at the point where the government could review restrictions. The UK added 854 people to the Covid-19 death toll on Tuesday, as a study predicted the country would have Europe\u2019s worst coronavirus death toll. In Europe as a whole, deaths rose above 50,000 but some countries including Denmark and Norway have started to ease lockdown measures. Meanwhile in Turkey, the infection rate is rising faster than anywhere else in the world. President Recep Tayip Erdo\u011fan has refused to order a lockdown.\nThe effect of coronavirus on Australian businesses has been revealed, with a study showing that two-thirds of businesses across all sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to Covid-19. A staggering 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector have been forced to reduce the hours of their staff. Australians remain convinced of the government\u2019s response though, with the number of people trusting official advice rising to 63%, according to the Guardian Essential poll. Trust in the media to provide honest and objective information about Covid-19 jumped from 35% to 51% over the same two-week period.\nDonald Trump was warned of the devastating impact of Covid-19 in January, before going on to downplay the threat of the virus. Memos written by Trump\u2019s economic adviser Peter Navarro gave a worst-case scenario of 500,000 deaths. Trump, whose fortune has declined by a $1bn due to stock market crashes, showed more pressing concern for Boris Johnson, asking an unnamed group of pharmaceutical CEOs to offer the UK prime minister experimental coronavirus drugs.

        "content": "Harbour seals struggle to match volume of passing ships when trying to attract a mate\nCruise ships are drowning out the roars of seals that are important for bagging a mate, researchers have found in the latest study to reveal the consequences of human activity on wildlife.\nShips are known to produce low-frequency sounds which can overlap with calls made by marine creatures. But now researchers studying harbour seals say such noise could be taking its toll.\n\u201cAs it gets noisier, it becomes harder for harbour seals to be heard,\u201d said Dr Michelle Fournet, a co-author of the research at Cornell University, noting the animals\u2019 roars serve a number of purposes \u2013 including advertising to females and establishing underwater territories.\nWriting in the journal Biology Letters, Fournet and colleagues report that they lowered an array of microphones into Glacier Bay in Alaska and recorded underwater sounds during May to October 2015. The team then analysed data from a nine-day period that overlapped with the peak breeding period for harbour seals.\nAmong the sounds recorded were roars of male harbour seals, as well as the noise from other animals and passing shipping. \u201cVessels in general are one of the largest contributors to underwater sound in this area,\u201d said Fournet.\nOverall, the team analysed recordings of 545 underwater roars, produced by at least four different male harbour seals.\nFournet said widespread animals such as harbour seals are generally thought to be resilient to human activity.\nHowever the team found little, if any, difference in the loudness of roars made by the seals during noisy periods, when cruise ships were known to be passing, compared with those made during quiet periods when the ships were absent. The duration or frequency of the roars also showed no tangible difference.\nInstead, the team found that the loudness of a roar beyond the rest of the soundscape fell by about 0.86 decibels for every one decibel increase in noise in the environment caused by the cruise ships. In other words, the area over which they could communicate shrank.\n\u201cBecause the harbour seals are already calling as loud as they can possibly call \u2026 as ocean noise gets louder, the ability to detect that signal goes down,\u201d said Fournet, adding that the animals were likely calling loudly even during quiet periods as this would be advantageous both in bagging a mate and defending territory \u2013 but it meant they may not be able to turn up the volume when cruise ships show up.\nThe team say the findings could potentially mean it is harder for males to find a mate, not least since the peak time for vessels including cruise ships overlaps with the animals\u2019 breeding season. They add that more research is needed to see if this is indeed the case, noting that the passage of cruise ships in Glacier Bay is concentrated to just two periods of the day.\nFournet added the coronavirus pandemic has opened up a new opportunities for research. \u201cWe are working right now on trying to get a hydrophone in the water so that we can listen [during breeding season] in the absence of ships for the first time,\u201d she said.\nDr Sarah Marley, an expert in the impact of noise on marine animals from the University of Portsmouth who was not involved in the study, said that noise from human activities has been increasing in the oceans \u2013 a trend that could change animals\u2019 behaviour or mask sounds they make for important activities.\nBut, she added, the new findings do not necessarily mean harbour seals have failed to adapt, noting that even quiet times in Glacier Bay may be noisier than locations without any shipping and hence require a louder roar.\n\u201cIt could be that the seals are already roaring at maximum levels during the so-called \u2018quiet\u2019 periods, and just can\u2019t go any further to communicate during the really noisy periods,\u201d she said.\nMarley added that the findings could have important ramifications for the UK, which has a population of about 43,000 harbour seals living in areas that, at least in part, overlap with those used by humans.\n\u201cIf man-made noise is impeding the breeding success of harbour seals, this could have important repercussions at the local and national level for seal management and conservation,\u201d she said.",

The proportion planning to furlough 100% of their workforce rose from 17% to 20%.\nAdam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, said: \u201cOur latest data shows that many businesses face a cliff-edge scenario, either at the end of this month or over the course of the next quarter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a big jump in the number of firms furloughing staff, and many are now starting to apply for access to government loan and grant schemes to keep themselves afloat. Yet our research suggests that support is only starting to reach firms on the ground.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the chancellor is listening and responding to our calls to strengthen the existing support. Improvements to the CBILS scheme should help more businesses get access to the cash they need over the coming days and weeks. This could be the difference between survival and insolvency for many firms.\u201d\nMarshall added: \u201cEvery minute counts, and governments, local authorities and banks must do everything in their power to ensure support gets to firms on the front line more quickly.\u201d",

Most on board are understood to be Australian, although there are also citizens of New Zealand, the US and the UK.\n\u201cWe found a ship where almost everyone has been infected,\u201d said Karina Rando, one of 21 Uruguayan doctors dispatched to the ship. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our utmost to prevent our own infection. Most of the passengers are well.\u201d\nMany of those who tested positive are still asymptomatic, but could still be at risk, said Rando.\n\u201cThere are many patients over 70 years of age, some of them with other chronic conditions such as heart and lung diseases,\u201d she said. \u201cThose patients may fall seriously ill tomorrow even if they looked well today.\u201d\nThe ship set out on 15 March from the Argentinian port of Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. It was to have undertaken a 16-day cruise to Antarctica and South Georgia, christened \u201cIn Shackleton\u2019s Footsteps\u201d after the Irish polar explorer, Ernest Shackleton.\nSymptoms of coronavirus started to appear soon after departure, and the ship diverted to the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. Even the ship\u2019s doctor fell ill with a fever and was left unable to perform his duties.\n\u201cWe have made it clear that the ill health and the isolation of the crew is making it difficult to maintain the same standard of essential services onboard,\u201d Aurora Expeditions told passengers on 2 April.\nUruguay denied permission for the ship to dock, and also refused to allow passengers or crew to disembark.\nThat decision was eventually reversed at the weekend, when a Uruguayan naval vessel was dispatched to the Greg Mortimer to remove six gravely ill passengers and take them to the British Hospital in Montevideo.\nOn Saturday the Uruguayan navy tweeted a video of a passenger \u2013 reportedly a British woman with pneumonia in both lungs \u2013 leaping from the moving cruise ship to the military vessel to be taken to hospital in the Uruguayan capital.\n\ud83d\udd34AHORA: Tercer pasajera brit\u00e1nica con s\u00edntomas de COVID-19 es embarcada en Lancha \u201cIsla de Flores\u201d \u2693\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfe pic.twitter.com/Rzgl5Q3Xbo\n\u201cThe people on the ship are calm but they are eager to go home,\u201d Marcelo Girard, a doctor at a Uruguayan medical facility where two people from the cruise ship are being treated, told the AP.\nPassengers from Australia and New Zealand will board an emergency flight bound for Melbourne on Thursday, Uruguayan authorities confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe cost per passenger is about US$9,300 and the cruise ship operator has asked the Australian government for help with expenses. On landing, the passengers will undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.\nOther passengers will have to wait longer. \u201cWe have been advised that European and American passengers that have tested positive to Covid-19 unfortunately must wait until they have a negative test result, after which we will be able to organise their departure via S\u00e3o Paulo [in Brazil] and then to their final destination,\u201d the company said.\nUruguay has 406 confirmed cases of coronavirus and has had six deaths.",

The state has recorded 5,489 deaths, up from 4,758 a day earlier. Those 731 deaths on Monday represent the highest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis started.\nAt least 3,544 people have died in New York City from Covid-19 as of Tuesday afternoon, the city reported, a figure that eclipsed those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attack, which claimed the lives of 2,753 people in the city.\nNew York has the highest number of cases of any US state, with 138,863 cases of coronavirus already confirmed. New York City has seen the largest number of cases and deaths within the state, with 74,601 cases.\nCuomo said officials would look ahead to restarting the economy but noted that the state was not there yet because coronavirus deaths were still happening at a high rate.\nHe added that the determination of when and how to restart the economy would depend on testing, particularly testing to confirm if people have coronavirus antibodies in their system and are likely to be immune to the virus.\nThe governor said New York would need to scale up its testing capacity to test a large number of residents and announced the state would invest in testing companies working to expand capacity.\nHe said he understood the frustration of residents who are asking when social distancing might come to an end.\n\u201cThis is like Groundhog Day, living through this bizarre reality that we\u2019re in,\u201d Cuomo said.\nBut the governor emphasized residents would need to continue to be patient in order to protect their loved ones and neighbors from contracting the virus.\n\u201cI get it, but it\u2019s only been 37 days,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cOur behavior affects the number of cases.\u201d\nNew York residents have been ordered to avoid holding large funerals.\n\u201cThese social distancing regulations are not just \u2018please\u2019. They\u2019re regulations,\u201d said Cuomo, who doubled the fine for violating the \u201cstay at home\u201d order yesterday.\n\u201cNow is not the time for large religious gatherings,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou do no one a service by making this worse and infecting more people.\u201d\nCuomo also noted the 1918 flu epidemic peaked in New York for six months, killing 30,000 of the state\u2019s residents. \u201cSocial distancing is working,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI know that it\u2019s hard, but we have to keep doing it.\u201d\nOn Monday, a New York City official warned it could establish temporary burial grounds in city parks.\nOn Tuesday, Cuomo urged New Yorkers to remember that each coronavirus death represented a human being who had a family.\n\u201cI guess one could get numb to the numbers,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cFor myself, I can tell you, the last thing I do is get numb.\u201d\nThe governor noted mourning in the state was intensifying as the death toll rises. \u201cThe pain is increasing. The grief is increasing,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHow you could get numb to any of this, I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t see the numbness, and I don\u2019t think New Yorkers see the numbness.\u201d\nCuomo said that he was proud of the work the state\u2019s healthcare system had done to save every person it could from dying of coronavirus.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis virus is very good at what it does, and it kills vulnerable people ... We can\u2019t stop that. The question is, are you saving everyone you can save?\u201d\nHe applauded the work of medical professionals, saying: \u201cWhat they have done is incredible.\u201d\nHe also thanked other essential workers, such as transit employees.\n\u201cThey know what they\u2019re exposing themselves to, and they still do it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cGod bless them.\u201d\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose workers operate buses and subway trains in New York City, has already lost 33 members to coronavirus.\nAgencies contributed reporting",

This agreement stipulates that any activities in space should conform to international law. In 2015, the US Congress passed a law explicitly allowing American companies to use resources from the moon and asteroids.\nAccording to Trump\u2019s executive order, the US will object to any attempt to use international law to hinder its efforts to remove chunks of the moon or, should the opportunity arise, additional mining of Mars and \u201cother celestial bodies\u201d.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new zeal to commence the drilling of the moon is consistent with its enthusiastic support of mining back on Earth. The administration has opened up vast tracts of federal land for oil and gas drilling, with Trump rolling back various environmental laws in an attempt to revive the ailing coal industry.\nNot all of the terrestrial drilling leases on offer have been taken up by fossil fuel companies, however, and it is uncertain what interest there is in the private sector to blast into space to mine the moon. The executive order states that the federal government will \u201crequire partnership with commercial entities to recover and use resources, including water and certain minerals, in outer space\u201d.\nTrump has taken a consistent interest in asserting American power in space, forming the Space Force within the US military last year to conduct space warfare where needed. The president appeared to be confused about the composition of space, however, when he tweeted in June that Nasa \u201cshould be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part).\u201d\nIt is unclear whether the president actually thinks the moon is a part of Mars but the two are in fact quite far apart \u2013 the moon, which orbits Earth, is around 238,000 miles away from our planet while Mars, which is itself a planet, is an average of 140m miles away from Earth.",

        "content": "Lodi witnessed country\u2019s first lockdowns and is now reporting steady declines in new cases\nOn 21 February, the Lombardy province of Lodi was at the centre of Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak when the first locally transmitted case was confirmed in the town of Codogno. The town was immediately put under lockdown, with 10 others across the province, which lies south of Milan, following suit the next day.\nToday, as calls to emergency lines return to pre-outbreak levels, Lodi is offering a glimmer of hope for how the rest of Italy might overcome the pandemic and make its way out of the lockdown.\nIn recent weeks, the province, which has a population of about 230,000, has seen a sustained decline in the rate of new infections, with total cases by Monday reaching 2,278, a rise of 23 since Sunday.\n\u201cThe first few days were very brutal, characterised by a significant number of patients with breathing difficulties,\u201d said Stefano Paglia, the chief of the emergency unit at Codogno and Lodi city hospital.\n\u201cNow the situation is normalising, we still deal with some Covid-19 patients, but the situation has gone from one of maximum emergency to returning to more ordinary levels of management.\u201d\nFabrizio Canevari, an operations manager at Soreu della Pianura, a safety and first aid service that manages calls to emergency numbers covering four Lombardy provinces, including Lodi, said: \u201cOn day three of the outbreak we had 2,300 calls, on Sunday there were 480, so we are returning to a relatively normal level of activity.\u201d\nThe emergency unit at Codogno hospital was closed immediately after the first coronavirus case was detected, with services transferred to the hospital in Lodi city. Up until last week, the hospital had treated 1,700 Covid-19 patients, of whom 300 died.\n\u201cThere are positive signs in Lodi because the early lockdown blocked, or at least greatly limited, the circulation of the virus,\u201d said Walter Ricciardi, an adviser to the Italian health ministry on the coronavirus outbreak and a member of the World Health Organization.\n\u201cFor sure, there is less pressure now and for this reason the health services can manage a situation which in the early days could only be done with a great deal of effort, but I predict we\u2019ll still need several days before things completely return to normal.\u201d\nThe province of Bergamo, north of Milan, suffered a similar fate to Lodi at the beginning of the outbreak, in that the virus was initially misdiagnosed at a hospital in the town of Alzano Lombardo, allowing it to spread to other patients and health workers.\nAlthough the first case in Bergamo was confirmed on 23 February, the province of 1.2 million people only went into lockdown with the rest of the Lombardy region on 8 March, during which time it quickly became Italy\u2019s \u201cground zero\u201d. As of Monday, there were 9,815 confirmed coronavirus cases across Bergamo province, while the death toll in March was 2,060, according to official figures.\n\u201cThere is also a trend of improvement in Bergamo but whereas Lodi is in an advanced stage of progress, Bergamo is still in the thick of the situation,\u201d added Ricciardi.\nAcross Italy, the curve of new cases is flattening, with 1,941 new infections registered on Monday, the lowest day-to-day rise in a week. Italy\u2019s lockdown is currently due to expire on 13 April, however easing restrictions at this stage would be \u201cpremature\u201d, said Ricciardi.\n\u201cChina implemented measures for three months and had a plateau [of new infections] that continued for 20-25 days before it started to decrease,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in the first month-and-a-half of the lockdown, so I think we still need to resist and wait for the curve to fall definitively.\u201d\nThe Italian government is studying a combination of measures that would allow the country to gradually move towards easing the lockdown, including a system to test, trace and contain the virus.\n\u201cWe are assessing the technological solutions for testing and tracing and hope to do experiments over the next two weeks. The system should be ready by the end of the month, or early May,\u201d said Ricciardi.\nItaly\u2019s southern regions have so far managed to stave off a surge in infections.\n\u201cCases in the south are still going up but they are going up slowly,\u201d said Giorgio Sestili, a physicist who is collating studies from Italian scientists and sharing them on the Facebook page Coronavirus \u2013 Data and Scientific Analysis. \u201cHowever, the lockdown is still fundamental.\u201d",

New Zealand\u2019s government announced a strict national lockdown a fortnight ago that requires everyone except essential workers to stay home at all times, unless they are accessing vital services or walking for exercise.\nJacinda Ardern, the prime minister, said while the country \u201cmight see bumps along the way,\u201d she was encouraged that the country might be \u201cturning a corner\u201d in quashing the spread of the virus.\n\u201cI have cautious optimism, but now is the time to stay the course,\u201d she told reporters at parliament in Wellington on Wednesday.\nIn total, 1,210 total cases have been reported in New Zealand with 282 of those people now recovered from the virus. One person has died of the coronavirus since the pandemic began.\nThere are 12 people in hospital, four of them in intensive care and two of those in a critical condition.\nNew Zealand\u2019s approach in invoking early, restrictive shutdown measures has been widely praised. But two weeks into a lockdown of at least four weeks, officials warned against complacency as arrests rose over breaches of the rules.\nA total 76 people were caught by officers violating the stay-at-home restrictions in the previous 24 hours alone, said police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday, adding that a total of 367 breaches had been recorded by the police so far.\nEight officers had been forced into self-isolation after people claiming to have Covid-19 had spat on them in \u201cincredibly distressing\u201d incidents, Coster said.\n\u201cYou end up with people who don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re at risk,\u201d he added.\nWhile the restrictive measures have been widely supported in New Zealand, heads of industry urged MPs on Wednesday for more clarity on a roadmap for how businesses would exit the lockdown.\nPhil O\u2019Reilly, the former chief executive of Business New Zealand, told meeting of the parliamentary committee scrutinising the government\u2019s actions on Covid-19 that firms understood officials could not yet say when the most restrictive shutdown measures would end. But lifting them without warning would cause \u201call sorts of confusion\u201d, he said.\n\u201cBusiness is not saying tell us a date,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying tell us a pathway.\u201d\nChris Roberts, representing the tourism sector, New Zealand\u2019s biggest export earner, said he expected an NZ$12bn drop in tourist spending over the next six months. Most companies had \u201czero\u201d income and would need government support beyond its wage subsidy scheme, he added.\nBut halfway through the country\u2019s month-long lockdown, attention was mostly fixed on surviving the next two weeks. Ardern, speaking at her daily news conference, was asked how her life had changed during the shutdown.\n\u201cI miss people,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is nothing against any of the fine people in this room,\u201d she added, referring to the reporters she briefs daily. \u201cBut I am used to having a lot of contact with the public.\u201d",

The most common purchase method has been personal contract plans (PCP), where a buyer puts down a deposit and then rents the vehicle for two to three years at a monthly cost, typically around \u00a3250.\nVolkswagen and Ford said they have already introduced emergency measures to help customers. VW, whose brands include Audi, Seat and Skoda, said it is taking \u201cexceptional steps\u201d to help lease-buyers keep hold of their vehicle.\nIt said customers will be offered a \u201cbreathing space\u201d of up to 60 days in which it won\u2019t chase the driver for payment or rack up fees. It said it will also consider extending the period of time for the buyer to pay off the debt.\nThe FLA said other forbearance measures may include payment breaks, payment reductions or waiving interest. \u201cLenders are working flat out to provide help but with reduced staff numbers it will take longer to get through. Please bear with them.\u201d\nCar dealers are keen to avoid a wave of cars being handed back by buyers unable to continue regular payments. The FLA said that the forebearance measures \u201cmay mean that handbacks do not increase as might have been anticipated\u201d.\nProblems in the UK car loans market may pale into insignificance compared with the colossal scale of auto lending in the US, which totals $1.3tn (\u00a31tn). Some of it has been securitised into bonds that bear echoes of \u201csubprime\u201d lending common before the financial crisis of 2007-08.\nAround $30bn of new subprime vehicle loans were issued in 2019, and there have been reports of some lenders verifying the income of just 8% of borrowers \u2013 whose loans are then bundled into bonds sold on Wall Street as an income stream for investors. However, the US Federal Reserve has already stepped in with a programme to support \u201casset-backed securities\u201d, including bonds holding auto loans.\nIn the UK, the FLA said it is seeking government help for car loan companies so that they can in turn provide help to customers. \u201cWe\u2019re in touch with government to ask that non-bank lenders have direct access to financial support schemes so that they can readily support the increased demand for forbearance from businesses and households,\u201d it said.\nNew car sales in Britain plummeted by 44% in March, a steeper fall than during the financial crisis, as the coronavirus led to showroom closures and sent sales tumbling.\nInchcape, which runs one of the biggest networks of franchised car dealership in the UK, said on Tuesday that it was scrapping its dividend and slicing 20% off the pay of the board and senior management.\nMeanwhile, the few remaining buyers in the car market are being offered extraordinary deals in a bid to keep sales afloat. Ford said new car buyers will benefit not just from 0% finance deals but also cashbacks and deferrals which mean they will not have to make any payments for the first six months.",

The harm reduction initiative offers people who are dependent on opioids such as heroin an alternative, typically methadone or buprenorphine.\nThe emergency changes proposed would allow pharmacists to hand out these substances without prescription, although only to patients who have been receiving the medicine as part of their treatment.\nIn its response, the 21-member council, chaired by Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, ultimately supported the proposals but warned that the move could lead to a rise in drug misuse.\nThe council said: \u201cThe measure would rely on the professional judgment of pharmacists, who will be working outside the scope of their usual practice.\n\u201cWithout adequate support and guidance for the healthcare professionals affected by the proposed legislative change, there is a risk that pharmacists struggling to follow best practices could inadvertently lead to an increase in drug misuse and diversion. This is a particular risk for patient groups requiring opioid pain medicines, eg for palliative care or for opioid substitution therapy (OST).\n\u201cAdditionally, whilst it will be necessary for the government to publicly announce in an emergency that these measures are to apply, common knowledge of the applicability of this measure may increase the risk of the misuse and diversion of controlled drugs.\n\u201cFor example, patients with substance misuse issues might attempt to place pressure on a pharmacist to dispense in accordance with this measure, or might visit a range of pharmacists in an attempt to locate and exploit weaknesses in any of their practices in order to be supplied with medicines against best practice.\u201d\nHowever, the council said that there was a risk that some GP surgeries could close during the pandemic as a result of staff shortages from illness or self-isolation, which might mean some patients being unable to access repeat prescriptions.\n\u201cA discontinuity of supply would pose a particular risk for patients receiving OST,\u201d the council said. \u201cIn the event that GP surgeries were closed during the pandemic, those patients might find they had less support and oversight from the relevant healthcare professionals, leading to an increased risk of relapse to illicit drug use.\u201d\nThe ACMD recommended that national-level guidance is produced in consultation with doctors and pharmacists before the measures are put in place.\nIn addition, the Home Office wants to apply a measure called a supply shortage protocol to certain controlled drugs, which would allow pharmacists to hand out alternatives without having to go back to doctors in the event that the prescribed drug is running low, as there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to supply due to the crisis.\nThe Council was broadly supportive of the measure but recommended this is only done as a last resort.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThese measures will help patients to access the medications they need without having to make frequent trips to the pharmacy. This will relieve pressure on our healthcare system and encourage people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the ACMD for addressing these proposals urgently, and we will consider their response carefully.\u201d",

        "content": "Dutch officials and British economist to use guide to help city thrive in balance with planet\nA doughnut cooked up in Oxford will guide Amsterdam out of the economic mess left by the coronavirus pandemic.\nWhile straining to keep citizens safe in the Dutch capital, municipality officials and the British economist Kate Raworth from Oxford University\u2019s Environmental Change Institute have also been plotting how the city will rebuild in a post-Covid-19 world.\nThe conclusion? Out with the global attachment to economic growth and laws of supply and demand, and in with the so-called doughnut model devised by Raworth as a guide to what it means for countries, cities and people to thrive in balance with the planet.\nRaworth\u2019s 2017 bestselling book, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist, has graced the bedside table of people ranging from the former Brexit secretary David Davis to the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who described it as a \u201cbreakthrough alternative to growth economics\u201d.\nThe inner ring of her donut sets out the minimum we need to lead a good life, derived from the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals and agreed by world leaders of every political stripe. It ranges from food and clean water to a certain level of housing, sanitation, energy, education, healthcare, gender equality, income and political voice. Anyone not attaining such minimum standards is living in the doughnut\u2019s hole.\nThe outer ring of the doughnut, where the sprinkles go, represents the ecological ceiling drawn up by earth-system scientists. It highlights the boundaries across which human kind should not go to avoid damaging the climate, soils, oceans, the ozone layer, freshwater and abundant biodiversity.\nBetween the two rings is the good stuff: the dough, where everyone\u2019s needs and that of the planet are being met.\nOn Wednesday, the model will be formally embraced by the municipality of Amsterdam as the starting point for public policy decisions, the first city in the world to make such a commitment.\n\u201cI think it can help us overcome the effects of the crisis\u201d, said Amsterdam\u2019s deputy mayor, Marieke van Doorninck, who joined Raworth in an interview with the Guardian via Skype before the launch. \u201cIt might look strange that we are talking about the period after that but as a government we have to \u2026 It is to help us to not fall back on easy mechanisms.\u201d\n\u201cWhen suddenly we have to care about climate, health, and jobs and housing and care and communities, is there a framework around that can help us with all of that?\u201d Raworth says. \u201cYes there is, and it is ready to go.\u201d\nThe central premise is simple: the goal of economic activity should be about meeting the core needs of all but within the means of the planet. The \u201cdoughnut\u201d is a device to show what this means in practice.\nRaworth scaled down the model to provide Amsterdam with a \u201ccity portrait\u201d showing where basic needs are not being met and \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d overshot. It displays how the issues are interlinked.\n\u201cIt is not just a hippy way at looking at the world,\u201d says Van Doorninck, citing the housing crisis as an example.\nResidents\u2019 housing needs are increasingly not being satisfied, with almost 20% of city tenants unable to cover their basic needs after paying their rent, and just 12% of approximately 60,000 online applicants for social housing being successful.\nOne solution might be to build more homes but Amsterdam\u2019s doughnut highlights that the area\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are 31% above 1990 levels. Imports of building materials, food and consumer products from outside the city boundaries contribute 62% of those total emissions.\nVan Doorninck says the city plans to regulate to ensure builders use materials that are as often possible recycled and bio based, such as wood. But the doughnut approach also encourages policymakers to lift their eyes to the horizon.\n\u201cThe fact that houses are too expensive is not only to do with too few being built. There is a lot of capital flowing around the world trying to find an investment, and right now real estate is seen as the best way to invest, so that drives up prices,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe doughnut does not bring us the answers but a way of looking at it, so that we don\u2019t keep on going on in the same structures as we used to.\u201d\nThe port of Amsterdam is the world\u2019s single largest importer of cocoa beans, mostly from west Africa, where the labour is often highly exploitative.\nAs an independent private company it could reject such products and take the economic hit, but at the same time almost one in five households in Amsterdam qualify for social benefits due to low incomes and savings.\nVan Doorninck says the port is looking at how it moves on from dependence on fossil fuels as part of the city\u2019s new vision, and she expects that to naturally evolve into a wider debate over other pressing dilemmas brought to the forefront by the doughnut model.\n\u201cIt gives space to talk about whether you want to be the place where products are being stored that are produced by child labour or by other forms of labour exploitation,\u201d she says.\nRaworth adds: \u201cWho would expect in a portrait of the city of Amsterdam that you would include labour rights in west Africa? And that is the value of the tool.\u201d\nBoth recognise the need for national government and supranational authorities to get on board. Raworth\u2019s last meeting just before the lockdown in Belgium was with the European commission in Brussels, where she says great interest was expressed.\n\u201cThe world is experiencing a series of shocks and surprise impacts which are enabling us to shift away from the idea of growth to \u2018thriving\u2019, Raworth says. \u201cThriving means our wellbeing lies in balance. We know it so well in the level of our body. This is the moment we are going to connect bodily health to planetary health.\u201d\n\u00a0This article was amended on 8 April 2020 to remove a superfluous zero from the figure of online applications for social housing, which is 60,000.",

It hopes that this will channel $1m (\u00a3800,000) to good causes.\n\u201cThe 40-40 campaign is our response to the severe economic and social hardship the Covid-19 epidemic will cause many people around the world,\u201d said Alquity\u2019s chairman, Paul Robinson.\nAlquity is also worried that the financial impacts of quarantining are more damaging for those on low incomes in emerging markets, as people have fewer savings and little regulatory protection.\n\u201cAs some of the freedoms and comforts we are used to in developed countries are dramatically reduced, we are getting a glimpse of what daily life is like for a some of the poorest people on the planet,\u201d Robinson said.\nAlquity wants clients to sign up to its campaign and signal their support for sustainable economic development.\n\u201cBy signing up to the 40-40 partnership agreement, in addition to the enhanced donation, investors will be signalling their commitment to creating a fairer, more sustainable world,\u201d said Alquity\u2019s co-founder, Suresh Mistry.\nAlquity runs a range of funds which invest in emerging markets. Founded in 2009, it uses environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards when choosing which stocks to buy. It already donates at least 10% of its management fees to charitable causes, as a \u201csocial investment\u201d, and will raise this to 40% for money invested through the campaign.\nSince launching its Transforming Lives Foundation in 2011, Alquity has donated around $2m \u2013 which it says has helped some 60,000 people.\nOne project backed by Alquity, called Phool, recycles flowers from Indian temples into incense sticks, which are then sold. This has provided income for more than 1,200 women, and prevented the flowers from being thrown away into rivers.\nIt has also supported educational projects in Vietnam, Uganda and Brazil, women\u2019s employment projects in Ghana and Mexico, and waste collection groups in India and Kenya.

Thirty cartons are not enough,\u2019 says one\nCommunity stores servicing hundreds of Aboriginal communities now in lockdown say they are still having trouble finding essential supplies, and are pleading with city dwellers to stop hoarding.\nMai Wiru, a not-for-profit corporation that supplies 11 community stores in remote South Australia and the Northern Territory, said stockpiling and hoarding in towns and cities had made it hard to source and supply the basics to remote communities.\n\u201cWe have been trying to buy toilet paper for weeks now,\u201d said the CEO of Mai Wiru, Dennis Bate. \u201cI\u2019ve had buyers out there scouring the countryside to buy bulk toilet paper and not much luck.\n\u201cWe have to supply 5,000 people. Thirty cartons a week is just not enough.\u201d\nMai Wiru operates a weekly road train from Adelaide which takes several days to deliver to all the community stores.\n\u201cSo if our load is picked on a Monday, we have to make do with what we can get on that day. We get one bite of the cherry.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get it then, we are never going to see toilet paper,\u201d he said.\nMai Wiru has doubled its road train service, but Bate said he was \u201cworried about how we are going to keep this up\u201d.\nThe demand in communities was greater, he said, because so many people were sent home under biosecurity measures, but those same measures meant shipping supplies into those communities was more difficult.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the ramifications; it\u2019s quite complex. There are restrictions on who can go out to the stores. As CEO, I have to get special police permission. That takes out half of our regular freight companies, and those who remain have their own set of priorities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an uneven playing ground. My long-term worry is the hoarding. That\u2019s the issue.\n\u201cWoolies and Coles are making a killing out of this, and the silly punters have brought on themselves. But there are ramifications for people down the line. Stop hoarding, let the manufacturers catch up and it\u2019ll all go down again.\n\u201cShare it out. There\u2019s enough to go around.\u201d\n A spokesperson for Woolworths said it appreciated \u201cthe current situation is frustrating for our customers in remote communities\u201d.\n\u201cThere has been an unprecedented level of demand for groceries, which has put enormous pressure on Australian supply chains.\n\u201cWe are working hard behind the scenes with a number of key stakeholders, including the government, to improve the situation for the benefit of these communities.\u201d\nColes said it was \u201clifting restrictions on all known remote groups for Coles online deliveries\u201d, was making weekly deliveries to some communities in isolation, including Yarrabah in Queensland, and was working with the Western Australian government to provide a remote order service.\nThe Central land council said the big supermarket chains also need to lift item restrictions so that remote communities could buy in bulk and spare themselves trips into towns like Alice Springs for supplies.\nThe minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt met with the big supermarkets, the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, and community store operators to guarantee supply chains for the expected months-long duration of the Covid-19 lockdown.\nWyatt said there was a lot of goodwill to resolve the situation.\n\u201cWe will meet again in two weeks time to see how the goodwill is translated into outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is a focus on the top items stores provide to communities, and the challenge also is the changing season, which means that if there\u2019s rain, then some of them will have challenges in having access to food supply. So we\u2019ll look at options as to how we get food into those communities.\n\u201cAs the chief minister [Gunner] said, this is about the way in which governments at all levels ensure food continuity to Aboriginal communities in remote areas.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked them to stay in their communities so we also have to ensure that food safety or access paramount.\u201d\nWyatt said he has asked the national Covid-19 coordination commission to work with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to monitor the cost of goods in remote communities, and ensure that enforcement measures are communicated to store operators.",

He flew to Turkey in early February.\nBut when the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the world, Amir cut short his trip and boarded a flight back to Australia.\nHowever, as he travelled back, Australia\u2019s ban on foreign nationals entering the country was announced and came into force. Only citizens and those holding permanent residency could enter.\nIn Indonesia, despite holding valid travel documents, Amir was refused permission to board his flight home, and was forcibly put on a plane back from where he\u2019d flown \u2013 Amsterdam \u2013 with the threat he would be sent further back to Moscow and Istanbul.\nThere were fears too, that his refugee status might not be honoured in Moscow, and he could be refouled to Iran, in breach of international law.\nRefugee advocates feared a repeat of the Hakeem al-Araibi case, which left a refugee wrongly detained in a Thai prison after a series of bureaucratic bungles over his visa status.\nHowever, after intervention from Amir\u2019s local MP, Labor member for Wills Peter Khalil, representations by the UNHCR and Australia\u2019s ambassador to the Netherlands, Amir was granted permission to stay in transit at Amsterdam airport while an exemption was sought from the Australian government to allow him to travel home.\nThe exemption was initially refused by the Australian Border Force but after intervention by the acting immigration minister, Alan Tudge, the exemption was granted, allowing Amir to fly to Melbourne after days spent in an uncertain limbo in a foreign airport.\nHe is currently in a Melbourne hotel, as part of a 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals into the country.\n\u201cWe are in unprecedented times,\u201d Khalil told the Guardian, \u201cand dealing with extraordinary bureaucratic complications. The travel rules and restrictions that were put out have affected thousands of people and Amir was caught up with that.\n\u201cBut he is under Australia\u2019s protection, and there were real fears for what might happen to him. But working cooperatively, we were able to get through the bureaucratic entanglements to get Amir home.\u201d\nThe Guardian is aware of a number of other cases of family members of Australian protection visa holders who are seeking exemptions from the travel ban in order to be able to rejoin family in Australia.",

The restrictions are among the toughest in the world, but as a result, new cases of coronavirus have begun to decline.\nDr Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health, has repeatedly encouraged Kiwis to get exercise through \u201cgardening\u201d, and the advice has been taken to heart.\nKing Seeds, the country\u2019s largest seed supplier, has temporarily suspended online ordering after experiencing 10 times its usual business.\nMany Kiwis appeared to be stockpiling seeds for summer, owner Gerard Martin said, or planting anything and everything out of panic, including watermelon, tomato and basil crops on the cusp of winter.\n\u201cThey [customers] are buying a lot more than they normally would and buying things that they don\u2019t need at this time of the year as well,\u201d Martin told Stuff.\nEgmont Seed company based in New Plymouth said there were would be \u201clarge delays\u201d on all of its orders, as demand for seed was \u201cunprecedented\u201d during the lockdown, with ordering spikes beginning on the first day of lockdown.\n\u201cThis time of year is normally our \u2018quiet\u2019 months,\u201d the company said on its website.\n\u201cWe are clearly not keeping up and clearly never will \u2026 PLEASE EXPECT DELAYS.\u201d\nIn Australia, The Diggers Club, one of the country\u2019s largest gardening clubs and seed catalogues, paused new product orders due to \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d.

On its Australian website, Yates suspended all new orders saying \u201cwe have completely sold out\u201d.\nBronwyn Alder, from the independent plant shop Newtown Garden Market, experienced a run on seeds first hand. \u201cIt\u2019s both the seeds and the edible seedlings,\u201d she told Guardian Australia.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the phone ringing off the hook for people interested in growing seeds for the first time. There\u2019s been so much new interest in gardening for edible plants. The amount of new gardeners who are interested in edibles is unparalleled.\u201d\nThe market gets new stock at the beginning of every season, and they usually \u201chave a decent supply in\u201d. However, this year, \u201cwithin a week and a half we had no seeds on the rack. We\u2019ve been trying to order more, but our supply chain can\u2019t get any more in. They\u2019re struggling with the demand \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone was prepared.\u201d\nAlder does not believe her customers are hoarding seeds, however. \u201cI think there are some people who are feeling fearful \u2026 about food security, and have a genuine interesting in growing their own for food protection. And I think there are people who are bored and want a hobby.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe silver lining to [the coronavirus crisis] may be that 2020 is the year people\u2019s gardens look great again.\u201d\nIn New Zealand, seed companies said there was no shortage of supply and urged gardeners to buy normally, and only what they immediately intended to plant.\nOnline, membership of gardening groups has boomed, with people sharing lockdown ideas for weaving weeds into baskets, planting strawberry seeds scooped out of shop-bought strawberries, and growing new roots for supermarket lettuces and leeks.\n\u201cPlanted on the very first day of lockdown we are now picking and eating mizuna and bok choy,\u201d wrote one woman on the New Zealand Budget Gardening page.\n\u201cSilverbeet is ready too.\u201d",

Contains spoilers \u2026\nThe 18-year-old daughter of businessman Benjamin Horne, Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn) dresses to please herself. First seen in a demure sweater and pleated kilt, she changes from brogues to scarlet stilettos when she leaves her father\u2019s car and arrives at school, a scene Spooner describes as an \u201cintensely personal moment of autoeroticism\u201d. This exploration continues, spelled out in clothes, as she and Agent Cooper get closer. We see Audrey in more sweaters, more kilts, in lingerie and \u2013 in the infamous cherry stalk scene \u2013 in an off-the-shoulder Little Black Dress. Her seductive dance in a kilt in the Double R diner, which contrasts Audrey with the distinctly ordinary fleece-clad Donna, is now a cult reference. It was reprised, with Fenn in black lace, for Twin Peaks: The Return in 2017. Thirty years on, Audrey Horne is still feeling herself.\nSpooner describes Nadine as an example of how the show up-ends our idea of a uniform as something that \u201cshould normally comfort us by showing everyone in their right place\u201d. In Twin Peaks \u201cthey tend to disconcert us because there is something \u2018off\u2019 about them.\u201d Indeed, a 35-year-old woman combining a cheerleader\u2019s outfit with an eyepatch and wild hair is a through-the-looking-glass idea of an Americana icon, representing Nadine\u2019s regression to her teenage self after a suicide attempt. If Nadine has spawned many Halloween costumes, her signature look has also gained relevance recently thanks to Cheer, the Netflix documentary about Navarro College\u2019s cheerleading squad. It\u2019s safe to say that when it comes to style, Nadine has made mat.\nIf Lynch hadn\u2019t made up the Log Lady, she might have appeared on Alessandro Michele\u2019s Gucci catwalk anyway. Played by the director\u2019s friend, Catherine Coulson, her outfit of a 70s-style cardigan, shirt, poloneck and oversized glasses has a retro geek chic feel that is now a familiar aesthetic. It was also the mood music around that statement log, reportedly valued at $275,000. Coulson\u2019s character has since been celebrated as a patron saint of outsiders who are willing to live \u2013 and dress \u2013 as they please. The actor once described her character as \u201cthe most normal person on the show\u201d and when Bravo showed repeats of Twin Peaks in 1993, the Log Lady introduced each episode. Lynch described her as the \u201chostess with the mostess [sic]\u201d. The Log Lady\u2019s legendary status was sealed with 2017\u2019s The Return. While Coulson died in 2015, she stars in a moving posthumous performance, wearing those glasses with the breathing apparatus required to treat her cancer.\n\nIn 2017, Vice called James Hurley both \u201cthe worst thing about Twin Peaks\u201d and \u201cthe original sad lad\u201d. Hurley is clearly meant to be a walking cliche, a cypher of American masculine teenage rebellion: you can tell because he wears a biker jacket and shades, and drives a motorcycle. Spooner points to Hurley\u2019s biker jacket as an item that operates symbolically. Like his name, and his serenading of fellow teens, it\u2019s an item that puts him in the same lineage as James Dean and Chris Isaak, while signposting gently that he\u2019s not really worthy of all the women \u2013 Laura Palmer, Donna, Maddy \u2013 who fall for him. Reprising his much-trolled guitar playing for the new series, the jacket was noticeably absent \u2013 perhaps because a middle-aged man wearing one might spell something different, namely a mid-life crisis.\n\nLike Don Draper in Mad Men, Agent Dale Cooper is everything to Twin Peaks: hero, symbol, plot device, fashion reference. It\u2019s his voice we hear first in the series, closely followed by a shot of him hanging upside down in tartan boxers and a clean white vest. Everything about Agent Cooper\u2019s look is, as it is with Draper, clean, neat, presentable and uniform: short back and sides; crisp, fresh suit, trenchcoat. In a post-normcore world, this has been celebrated by fashion. Kyle MachLachlan, who plays Cooper, attended Balenciaga\u2019s fashion show in 2018 with the label\u2019s hyped designer Demna Gvasalia commenting that he was \u201calways on my moodboard\u201d. After The Return, in which MacLachlan plays five separate Coopers, Gvasalia\u2019s moodboard will be full up. \u201cHis performance is masterful but obviously it is immeasurably assisted by costume,\u201d says Spooner. \u201c\u2018Bad Cooper\u2019 is a particular stroke of genius \u2013 MacLachlan\u2019s oddly neat ponytail and mod-inspired leather jacket are somehow exactly what you would expect Cooper possessed by the evil spirit of Bob to wear.\u201d\nEveryone is a little bit in love with Laura Dern right now. David Lynch was way ahead of Renata Klein fans, though. The actor\u2019s first major role was in his film Blue Velvet in 1986. While she didn\u2019t appear in the original two series, she plays Diane in The Return. Yes, that Diane, the secretary to whom Agent Cooper sends recordings throughout the series, a woman he describes as \u201can interesting cross between a saint and a cabaret singer\u201d. When we finally see Dern\u2019s Diane \u2013 and, indeed, her doppelganger \u2013 they don\u2019t disappoint. We see a razor-sharp bob, sometimes platinum, sometimes fire engine red; multicoloured fingernails and garments including a leopard jacket and emerald green pyjamas. \u201cIf the first two series were full of moments in which costume drew attention to itself, Diane\u2019s costume always draws attention to itself,\u201d says Spooner. \u201cIt also brings home how infrequently you see a middle-aged woman on screen dressed in a way that is quirky and eye-catching and unusual, yet positioned as stylish and cool, rather than \u2018eccentric\u2019 or \u2018fashionista\u2019.\u201d",

The discretionary nature of spending on fashion means investors have taken a dim view of the sector with the average market value of fashion and luxury companies dropping by almost 40% in the first three months of 2020 \u2013 a steeper decline than that of the overall stock market.\nEven before the outbreak began, stiff competition meant that more than half of the companies in McKinsey\u2019s benchmark global fashion index were described as \u201cvalue destroyers\u201d \u2013 meaning the profit made by a company did not exceed its cost of capital.\n\u201cThe pandemic spells more trouble for this group, which includes department store giants, high street brands and venture-backed startups,\u201d the report states. \u201cWe expect a large number of global fashion companies to go bankrupt in the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d\nWith a global workforce of more than 300m people the virus has triggered a terrible domino effect. The forced closure of high street stores and shopping centres has shed retail jobs and cancelled orders for new season stock have ricocheted around the globe putting millions of garment workers in sourcing markets such as Bangladesh, India and Cambodia out of work.\nFrom high-end to high street fashion there are already visible signs of distress. Burberry sits on a long list of suffering luxury goods companies, which also includes Coach-owner Tapestry, as wealthy consumers stop travelling and shopping.\nIn the UK alone analysts think around \u00a310bn worth of high street fashion is piling up in warehouses as major firms including Primark, Peacocks, Arcadia and Next stop taking new deliveries because they have run out of space.",

Caucus also agreed not to back any other attempts at non-government amendments in the Senate.\nIt was all settled by breakfast but the legislation didn\u2019t get through the House of Representatives for another nine hours.\nTo be fair to Labor, their amendments were genuine arguments for the scheme to be changed and sincere attempts to define potential problems.\nBut no amount of policy high-mindedness would have saved Labor from unsurvivable outrage had it even attempted to block the wage replacement program so many of its own voters needed.",

Has there ever been a season that was completed and then annulled?\u201d\nAlex von Fintel supplies a highly comprehensive and very possibly unbeatable answer. \u201cThe 1922 German football championship, the 15th edition of the competition, saw no champion determined after the first final ended in a 2-2 draw and the replay in a 1-1 draw,\u201d he writes. \u201cHamburg were initially awarded the title because the other finalist, Nuremberg, had been down to seven players through injuries. In the break of the extra time of the replay one Nuremberg player decided he couldn\u2019t carry on, bringing his team below the required number of eight players on the field.\n\u201cHamburg was awarded the title but Nuremberg successfully protested \u2013 the referee should have blown to start the second half of extra time and then immediately blown his whistle to abandon. Hamburg understandably launched a counter-protest and were awarded the title \u2013 but then declined the championship, probably under pressure from the football authorities. So the 1921\u201322 season was effectively abandoned 0.1 seconds before it would have finished \u2013 and it really was the ref\u2019s fault.\u201d\n There have been famous cases of league titles being stripped from clubs for reasons of corruption after a season has been played. Marseille in 1992-93 and Juventus in 2005-06 were both denied the title with differing decisions taken on what happened to the trophy. PSG, despite finishing second, did not accept the French title while Internazionale did in Italy. But Alex\u2019s suggestion may take some beating.\n\u201cWhich player has won the most competitions?\u201d asks Glenn Coburn. \u201cSurely James Rodr\u00edguez must be up there; he has won 23 trophies in 14 different competitions.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is the definitive answer, but I once read the former Porto goalkeeper V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda had won 40 major competitions in his career,\u201d says Alan Gomes. \u201cThis link lists a mere 34 major trophies in 11 competitions.\u201d\n  A couple of suggestions: Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s haul of the League Cup and Europa League with Manchester United took him to 16 different competitions if you include the Johan Cruyff Cup in the Netherlands, the Troph\u00e9e des Champions in France and the Community Shield, as his old friend Pep Guardiola would. Big Zlat\u2019s teammate at both Ajax and PSG, Maxwell, has won 16 too, having collected medals in Brazil, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France.\nFergal Harrington has a suggestion to add to the previous Knowledge\u2019s lead-off item of famous strikers on goal droughts. \u201cJust one to add to the list is none other than Ireland and Liverpool legend John Aldridge who took 20 games to score his debut goal for Ireland,\u201d he says. That came against Tunisia in a 4-0 win in October 1988 at Lansdowne Road. Fergal offers mitigation for Aldo, who ended up scoring 19 goals in 69 matches, a much lower rate of scoring than his league record of 330 goals in 610 matches. \u201cThe tactics used by Big Jack Charlton probably were different to the way Liverpool were playing.\u201d\n\u201cWho were the first football club to have an official website?\u201d wondered Chris White back in 2016. \u201cI can help,\u201d yells Martyn Amos, thrusting his arm in the air. \u201cIpswich Town were the first club to have a website (unofficial or otherwise). In fact, I used to help maintain it. It was set up in 1990 by Phil Clarke, who worked at BT in Martlesham (near Ipswich) when the web was still very much experimental. He then passed it on (1993-1995) to Paul Felton, who was a student at UEA in Norwich (boo, hiss).\n\u201cAfter Paul graduated, he passed it on to me, as I was, at the time, a PhD student at Warwick (1995-1996). Paul then took it back in 1996, and ran it until 2001, when the club finally woke up to the potential of the web, and got a local company called AWS to run it \u2026 There used to be some discussion with Sheffield United fans about our claim to primacy, but I believe that it was decided in our favour.\u201d\n@TheKnowledge_GU The Santos-Botafogo game played on this day in 1962 featured eight current world champions.\u00a4 Is that a record? Pel\u00e9, Zito, Gylmar, Mauro, Garrincha, Amarildo, Nilton  Santos, Zagallo.\u00a4 It's 11 including those who won medals but didn't play in the finals.\n\u201cWhile researching a quiz I\u2019ve compiled about Grimsby Town (if you\u2019ll allow the plug), I noticed that all eight of the fifth-round ties in the 1993 FA Cup were won by the home team,\u201d writes Tom Johnson. \u201cHas there ever been a last-32 in a cup competition with all 16 ties being won by the home team? Or any earlier round?\u201d\n\u201cHas a player ever celebrated a goal by kissing the badge of a club he was on loan to at the time?\u201d asks Tom, also.\nWhich player had the most successful career without ever playing \u2018at home\u2019? John McGovern won the European Cup twice with Forest, but only played one international in Scotland (for the under-23s!) plus a couple of away legs in the Anglo-Scottish cup.\nWhat are the most colours featured on any one kit?\n\u201cI was wondering if a player has ever scored 100 goals for three different clubs?\u201d wonders Dom Douglas. \u201cI can think of a few who have done it for two (Ronaldo, Cavani and Shearer spring to mind) but three would be a truly awesome feat.\u201d\n@TheKnowledge_GU Which professional full time teams play on the narrowest and widest pitches?\nWhat is the highest number of goals in a season that a player has scored for a relegated club? And has one ever finished as the league's top scorer?\nWhich manager has managed the most clubs they formerly played at?

        "content": "The game is in a unique position to lay down a marker in a sporting world that will be reshaped after fighting Covid-19\nThe release of a revised majors schedule arrived like a beacon of light. One isn\u2019t scraping barrels of insensitivity to point out that thoughts of the return of sport, not just exclusively at its elite level, get many people smiling during these grim and uncertain times. Disappointment that there will be no Open Championship in 2020 was offset by the thought of a US PGA Championship in August, a September US Open, the Ryder Cup going ahead as scheduled and a November Masters.\nThere is understandable scepticism about the validity of these plans, such is the scale of the coronavirus. The US PGA\u2019s window of early August in San Francisco appears a long shot. The PGA Tour seems willing to play tournaments behind closed doors \u2013 should adequate testing provision be in place \u2013 from June but indications are the European Tour won\u2019t be back in competitive mode until at least August.\nThe Race to Dubai finale, scheduled for November, and key European events leading in will inevitably be pushed back when a revised schedule is announced. We should, though, be more concerned with the form golf takes when it reappears. Never before has the game had it within its power to either be a force for good or show itself up as self-serving to the point of nausea. And make no mistake, individual sportspeople are more self-obsessed than most.\nNothing can be as it was for a long time; it would be ludicrous to suggest otherwise. If golf is on its way back in tournament format, what can it contribute in return? The notion of multimillionaires simply returning and doing their bit for commercial partners is borderline offensive.\nGolf has displayed a richer appetite than many other sports to get back to something even approaching normality, which is fine providing there is an inherent willingness to offer demonstrative benefit to public services and communities which have endured months of suffering. Asking Player X what his yardage was on the last par-three. No thanks. Golf must be grateful \u2013 very grateful \u2013 if it is permitted leeway in 2020, and act accordingly.\nOrdinarily, the PGA Tour\u2019s season would conclude with the payment of a US$15m bonus from a $70m pot at the conclusion of the FedEx Cup. The figure is typically justified, not unreasonably, in context of non-performance related pay as bestowed on leading sportsmen in the United States. Cries for playing opportunity may well mean the PGA Tour enlarges the field sizes at the FedEx play-off events \u2013 therefore changing them by all recognition anyway - but the aggregate prize needs reconsideration.\nAfter mass global loss of life and an economic crash it would be beyond unwise to hand $15m to a golfer. You would hope someone at FedEx or the Tour has already deduced that much.\nMost leading players either have charity foundations or give regularly to worthy causes. Paul Casey, for example, is a high-profile and firm supporter of Unicef. The PGA Tour itself is not shy in donating to a greater good. But if golf wants to restart, therefore relying to a large extent on the very groups who have been under pressure for so long, it has to create a fresh narrative. The game should be a net contributor to the world\u2019s recovery from coronavirus, not a gleeful benefactor. Or, indeed, a virtue signaller.\nIf the US PGA Championship, US Open and Masters make it to tee-off time, key workers should be first in line for free tickets. If the events are to be played minus large crowds \u2013 and that is entirely possible \u2013 the same people should still be the first in line for free tickets. Birdies and eagles should trigger automatic donations to the very services that were stretched to the point of breaking by coronavirus.\nThese are simple moves; it is incumbent on the sport as a whole to do much more. It is perhaps churlish to shrug off Augusta National\u2019s $2m donation to local entities to help with the pandemic but context is necessary; the club reportedly paid three times that figure to acquire real estate early in 2020. Last year\u2019s Masters prize fund stood at $11m. As the golf world obsesses about \u201cwhen\u201d the collective thought process should change towards \u201chow\u201d.",

The UK has been criticised for its slow start on ramping up testing. \n Edward Argar, a health minister, said on Wednesday that the UK \u201chasn\u2019t got the testing issue wrong\u201d, after Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said there were lessons to learn from Germany\u2019s high testing rate and slower increase in deaths.\nArgar, who toured the broadcast studios, said the UK recognised it needed to ramp up the number of tests being carried out but he downplayed the importance of Germany as a model to follow.\nHe said the UK was seeing \u201crapid increases in testing\u201d and Hancock was determined to meet his target of 100,000 a day.\nAsked about Whitty\u2019s view that Germany had \u201cgot ahead\u201d on testing, Argar said there were other factors in the country\u2019s apparent success in flattening its curve.\n\u201cI would absolutely expect him to say we need to look at what other countries have done that has had a really positive impact,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cBut I would come back to his caveats in which he did also say there were a whole range of factors for why Germany\u2019s death rate does at the moment appear to be lower.\u201d\nHe also repeated suggestions that the UK lockdown was likely to be extended next week, even though the government has refused to confirm that.\n\u201cWe need to start seeing the numbers coming down and that\u2019s when you\u2019re in the negative,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a sense when that\u2019s sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that. We\u2019re not there yet and I don\u2019t exactly know when we will be.\u201d\nExperts have said the UK should not be coming out of the lockdown without developing a clear strategy for stamping out the virus through mass testing.\nWhitty, when asked on Tuesday about the differences with Germany, said: \u201cWe all know that Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus, and there\u2019s a lot to learn from that.\u201d\nGermany is able to test 500,000 patients a week and is under pressure to increase this further.\nThe government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had given a more circumspect reply, saying: \u201cThe German curve looks as though it\u2019s lower at the moment, and that is important, and I don\u2019t have a clear answer to exactly what is the reason for that.\u201d",

The yodelling tone, the semi-scripted big lines. It always seemed a bit much.\nEven that stone cold Motson classic, \u201cthe Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club\u201d, was basically quite weird, an unexplained zigzag into sexually androgynous New Romantic cod-reggae in the moment of Wimbledon\u2019s FA Cup final triumph. \u201cThe Crazy Gang have beaten the Rat Pack.\u201d That might have been better, but only if we really must have an underdog 1950s British comedy troupe riff at this point.\nBut Motson on Brazil was always brilliant. He was there at all the big World Cup moments. Each time you felt he really did love Brazilian football, that the oddly sensuous, flushed round of gurgles and squawks came from a genuine place.\nSpain 1982 was the last really captivating version of those premodernity, pre-Nike Brazil teams. Defeat to Italy was epic-scale and oddly heartbreaking. Mainly, though, it looks now like the end of something.\nNot that anyone really got that at the time. The game was an instant, indelible classic. It had two of the best World Cup teams in two of the best World Cup kits. It had Motson on the BBC in prime full-warble mode. It had the best scoreline, 3-2, lodged perfectly in between overly chaotic goal-madness and just enough goal-madness.\nAnd it had something beautiful, too, Brazil\u2019s team of all the No 10s broken like a butterfly on a wheel by the gristlier, more industrial football of Italy\u2019s champions-in-waiting.\nTel\u00ea Santana\u2019s team had won their three first group stage games by an aggregate of 10-2. For this game they had a dream midfield of Cerezo-Falc\u00e3o, with S\u00f3crates and \u00c9der ahead of them, plus Zico, the perfect No 10, just off the front man. Who was, as it happened, a bludgeon in a team of scalpels. \u201cWhen Serginho plays, the ball is square,\u201d one Brazilian journalist wrote.\nBy contrast, Italy had Paolo Rossi, recently returned from a match-fixing ban and a ghost in his three goalless games at Spain 82 to that point. But he opened the scoring after five minutes in Barcelona with a header from a fine cross by Antonio Cabrini. The defending was terrible.\nBrazil were level seven minutes later through a piece of fantasy on the right. S\u00f3crates gave the ball to Zico, then ambled forward at a regal sprint. Zico Cruyff-spun away from Claudio Gentile and nudged a through pass that cut three defenders out. S\u00f3crates breezed on. He waited, breezed on a bit more, then shot low past Dino Zoff, the ball kicking up a startling puff of dust as it crossed the line.\nS\u00f3crates was mobbed: huge gangly arms outstretched, perfectly Grecian, impossibly wise and scorer now of a goal summed up the philosophy of Brazilian football. Although Motson slightly muddled that by adding: \u201cHow to play when you\u2019re behind!\u201d which didn\u2019t make much sense, or sum up any obvious philosophy, but you got the idea.\nParity didn\u2019t last long. With 25 minutes gone Cerezo gave the ball straight to Rossi. He ran on a few yards. The shot was straight down the middle. Waldir Peres dived out of the way.\nBrazil fretted and pressed and produced wonderful phases of attacking play. Gentile fouled Zico six times and even ripped a huge chunk out of his shirt. Brazil equalised after half-time, Falc\u00e3o spanking a shot into the top corner and veering off in a classic sinew\u2011straining celebration. A draw would suffice for Brazil.\nBut six minutes later Italy were ahead again as Rossi completed a fairly low-grade hat-trick, poking in from three yards. Brazil pressed but with a steadily depleting sense of destiny.\nItaly went on to beat Poland 2-0 in their semi, Rossi scoring both goals, then played their best football in a 3-1 defeat of West Germany in the final.\nFour years on, the spine of that Brazil team, creaking now but with a brilliant centre-forward in Careca, tried to right the agonising defeat of Barcelona. This time they lost agonisingly to France instead. Zico came on, semi-injured, and missed a penalty. S\u00f3crates looked sad and drawn.\nBrazil would win the World Cup again but their football was never quite the same again. Meanwhile, that game at Espanyol\u2019s old Sarri\u00e0 Stadium continues to spin in space, a perfect little sporting miniature.",

        "content": "Jim Harra says aim is to strike right balance between getting money out and preventing abuse \nA senior civil servant has said he expects organised crime will target the government\u2019s multibillion-pound employee furlough scheme.\nThe job retention scheme, which pays 80% of an employee\u2019s salary up to \u00a32,500 a month for up to three months, is due to come online for employers to make claims on 20 April.\nJim Harra, the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, told a committee of MPs that he expected it to be targeted by fraudsters.\n\u201cWe are going to be paying out a vast sum of money in a rapid period of time,\u201d Harra told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday. \u201cAny scheme like this is a target for organised crime. Any scheme that pays out I\u2019m afraid attracts criminals that want to defraud it and people that are genuinely entitled to it who inflate their claims.\u201d\nAnthony Browne, a Tory member of the committee, asked Harra how far the scheme was \u201copen to abuse\u201d, saying he had seen estimates that the government could end out paying \u00a330bn to \u00a340bn, although City economists have put a potentially far higher figure on the cost.\nHarra said HMRC had four \u201clines of defence\u201d to stop fraudsters, including a whistleblower hotline.\nA key safeguard is the stipulation that an employee has to have been on a payroll on 28 February in order to claim, which should prevent the creation of claims using fake employees.\nOther measures include:\nThe requirement for an employer to have already been authenticated by HMRC.\nA four- to six-day processing period to make background checks, which should flag high-risk claims.\nChecks made after payout to verify a claim was real.\n\u201cWe have to get a scheme set up rapidly and time has been the enemy of perfection in this,\u201d Harra said. \u201cWe believe we are striking the right balance protecting the exchequer from abuse and the imperative to get help out to those that need it as fast as we possibly can.\u201d\nHarra said he had a \u201chigh level of confidence\u201d that the online system being set up to take employer claims would not crash. HMRC said it had begun testing the system on Wednesday with a \u201csmall number of invited employers\u201d before the full launch on 20 April.\n\u201cWe are confident that the IT will cope with the very large volume of claims we expect to receive,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the IT side we have tested up to 450,000 claims an hour.\u201d\nHe admitted that if a very large number of employers phoned HMRC for help, its call centres \u201cwould struggle to provide the service we want\u201d.\nHarra said there were about 2,000 staff already dedicated to the helplines, and another 3,500 other employees would be redeployed to help deal with the huge number of claims expected when the service launches.\nIn terms of numbers of claimants, Harra said there were about 2 million PAYE schemes in the UK, with some employers using more than one scheme, covering about 30 million employees. He did not know the expected level of claimants, although there have been estimates of a minimum of 10% of employers.\n\u201cWe expect a very large number of those to claim in the first few days,\u201d he said. \u201cClaimants will be queued if necessary \u2013 anyone who has tried to get online shopping will know what that is like \u2013 but claims can be made online 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u201d",

        "content": "Making contact with Steven Spielberg\u2019s UFO spectacular once again, I find the movie\u2019s earthly concerns resonate even more powerfully than its sense of cosmic wonder\n The best arts and entertainment during self-isolation\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind is Steven Spielberg\u2019s family-sized late-70s UFO drama, starring Richard Dreyfuss as a midwestern Joe Schmoe who sees coloured lights in the sky and starts sculpting his mashed-potato into the shape of Devils Tower in Wyoming. It was, at the time, Columbia Pictures\u2019 highest-grossing blockbuster, and it proved the director of Jaws was no flash in the pan. Close Encounters was fantastical and mystical and sometimes borderline hysterical. And it was, for a few years, my absolute favourite movie.\nPauline Kael described it as \u201ca kid\u2019s film in the best sense\u201d, and she was absolutely right. Except, the first time I saw it, aged eight or so, it seemed impossibly sophisticated, gob-smackingly profound and as much a guide to the perplexing world of adulthood as it was to the galaxies above our heads. It contained messy homes and messy cars and a psychologically messy hero in electrician Roy Neary (Dreyfuss), who undergoes a Damascene conversion on the backroads of Indiana and returns home a wild-eyed zealot to spook his kids at the dinner table. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve noticed something a little strange with Dad,\u201d he tells them through the tears. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, though. I\u2019m still Dad.\u201d\nHow strange to learn that Spielberg actually wanted Steve McQueen to play the role. That would have made it a totally different film \u2013 the tale of a rugged all-American turned intergalactic pioneer, as opposed to an everyman in mortifying meltdown. Obviously Dreyfuss was the more interesting choice. He makes Neary grey-faced and rumpled and somehow older than his years; hot-wired by an obsession he can barely put into words and torching his career and his marriage without so much as a backward glance. As played by Dreyfuss, Neary doesn\u2019t rise to the occasion so much as descend to it, digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble before finally slipping down the mountainside to meet the alien mothership. In the view of the French government scientist played by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Roy Neary is a hero. In the view of everyone else, he\u2019s taken leave of his senses.\nAt the time, the Devils Tower finale was billed as the film\u2019s big bells-and-whistles showstopper. Viewed today, it feels over-extended, a tiresome piece of prog-rock noodling that one is tempted to watch on fast-forward. But as for the rest: well, it\u2019s still kind of wonderful; a storm of dustclouds and summer crickets and vast star-splashed skies. I love the breadth and business of Spielberg\u2019s picture. I love the din of different languages; the cross-fire of conversation (Robert Altman got there first, but I didn\u2019t know that at the time). Close Encounters is sunnier and simpler than the other great American films of its era. But it contains enough angst and confusion to keep it the right side of sappy.\nRewatching the movie, I\u2019m wondering exactly what quality hit me so hard as a child. Was it the tantalising prospect of first contact with space aliens? Or something smaller, knottier and altogether closer to home? The first time I saw it would have been shortly after my parents\u2019 divorce. These days that feels significant. Close Encounters is a film about a dissatisfied young father with one eye on the exit door. It also contains a frayed, exhausted single mum (played by Melinda Dillon) who suspects she can\u2019t protect her infant son. No doubt this would have sailed over my head at the time, but it seems likely that on some level I recognised my parents on the screen \u2013 and caught the faintest, fleeting understanding of how their lives were playing out.\nAlso Close Encounters painted a compelling picture of planet Earth \u2013 the alien land I\u2019m still trying to figure out to this day. Like every childhood favourite, it was a formative film, a gateway of sorts, opening out towards thornier, scarier, wilder views. I remember being especially struck by the scene in which Neary first encounters the extraterrestrials, when the power grid fails and the mailboxes start rattling and all the truck\u2019s clutter blows into the man\u2019s face. Spielberg made the adult world feel so rickety and impermanent, barely tethered to the ground and liable to be torn loose at any second. This was terrifying but it was thrilling too. It allowed for the possibility for transformation and adventure, hinting at a chaotic magic that might be hiding in plain sight.\nThat\u2019s probably why I never really liked the film\u2019s ending, when Neary is willingly led up the gangplank to the mothership. He\u2019s leaving the weird-looking mountain and the new friends he has made. He\u2019s leaving the backroads, the deserts, his family, the forests. He\u2019s leaving the untidy homes, messy cars and all those unpredictable people \u2013 and having sat through the film, I could never understand why he would. Because what was all that if not a comical abundance of riches? And who needs the cosmos when you\u2019ve got a world like this one?",

But three to six months down the line \u2026 staff are likely to suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome.\u201d\nPrerana Issar, chief people officer for the NHS, said: \u201cWe need to do everything we can to support our incredible NHS people as they care for people through this global health emergency.

        "content": "Available online\n This touching show about the schoolboy and reality TV stand-out Musharaf Asghar is compellingly performed\nIn 2013, Musharaf Asghar became an unlikely star of reality TV. A British-Pakistani pupil on Educating Yorkshire, he was propelled to fame when his teacher, Mr Burton, helped him to overcome his lifelong stammer with a method he had seen in a film about King George VI.\nThat King\u2019s Speech moment reduced audiences to tears, along with Asghar\u2019s speech at his end-of-year assembly. This musical, staged in 2019, dramatises those struggles with his speech impediment, alongside his relationship with Mr Burton and his single, steely-willed Mirpuri mother.\nThat golden TV moment does not translate into musical theatre with nearly the same emotional punch, but Mushy: Lyrically Speaking is a smart and touching show nonetheless, opening with a storming first hour of energetic song and drama.\nCo-produced by Rifco theatre company and Watford Palace theatre, the show has songs by the rapper Raxstar that burst with an irreverent spark. \u201cJust piss off,\u201d Mushy sings at his jeering bullies: \u201cThere\u2019s a mask on my face that I want to rip off.\u201d\nThere is a hugely compelling central performance from Varun Raj as Mushy, while Oliver Longstaff as Mr Burton and Medhavi Patel as Mushy\u2019s mother, Ammi, are both spirited. Under Ameet Chana\u2019s resourceful direction, the latter two double up in a variety of roles and give the impression of a bigger cast.\nEleanor Bull\u2019s set is delightfully minimalist in its versatility: an initial backwall of school lockers switches from the classroom to Mushy\u2019s home, the blackboard revolving to become a living-room cabinet, and then the cabinet revolving again to become the door of the boy\u2019s toilets at school.\nThese elements create dynamism in the first half, but the momentum flags by the second hour. Pravesh Kumar\u2019s book begins to focus on the after-effects of Mushy\u2019s TV fame, with all its shallow glories and inspirational speeches. The musical astutely shows that his fame is not a panacea for his problems, but too many scenes make the same point, and the arc of the story seems to stall.\nThere is also drama around Ammi\u2019s immigrant experience, but it is bluntly delivered at times, with jokes that repeat cultural cliches \u2013 of Asian parents forcing their children to be doctors and furniture being wrapped in plastic. These sound tired and overfamiliar, even if they are knowing.\nThe pace slows as a result, and there are not enough songs in the second half. But despite this, there are pleasures in this musical, and the mother and son relationship is sensitively rendered. One outstanding scene towards the end shows Mushy praying alongside his mother, and it is both moving and eloquent in its silence.\nAvailable online during the isolation period.",

A dispute between the Netherlands and Italy, the two countries at opposite poles of the EU\u2019s debt divide, thwarted an agreement on a package of loans that could be worth up to \u20ac540bn.\nAs the meeting broke up, the finance ministers of France and Germany issued a joint appeal on Twitter for an agreement. \u201cWe call on all European states to rise to the exceptional challenges to reach an agreement,\u201d wrote France\u2019s Bruno Le Maire, wording echoed by his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz.\nSpain warned the EU\u2019s future was at risk. \u201cThis is a crucial issue on which the European Union\u2019s future is at stake,\u201d the agriculture minister, Luis Planas, told Spanish radio. He said he was optimistic further talks would bring results.\nDuring the all-night talks, ministers largely sidestepped the divisive question of mutualised debt, so-called \u201ccorona bonds\u201d. They are expected to call on EU leaders to discuss how to finance an EU recovery fund \u2013 two weeks after the same heads of state and government called on their finance ministers to work out options.\nInstead, the main stumbling block was the conditions that should be attached to credit issued by the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.\nThe ESM has \u20ac410bn of unused lending capacity, which would allow the hardest-hit countries, such as Spain and Italy, to draw on emergency credit lines. About \u20ac240bn of this could be made available.\nUnder EU law, any country that takes a loan from the ESM must sign up to terms and conditions but countries are split over what they should be.\nItaly had wanted a reference to common debt issuance, to make using the EU bailout fund more politically palatable. The Netherlands held out for \u201cgrowth-infusing\u201d conditions attached to any credit lines from the bailout fund. The Dutch wanted to ensure that ESM credit lines were linked to measures to boost growth and balance budgets once the crisis was over.\nWhile there is agreement not to send in EU inspectors to monitor loans, southern European countries, such as Italy and Spain, have complained of being stigmatised for a crisis not of their making.\nMeanwhile, northern countries feel they have not been given enough credit for agreeing to wide-ranging changes that are controversial in their parliaments, such as suspending the EU\u2019s fiscal rules and supporting the expansionary policy of the European Central Bank, which announced a \u20ac750bn asset-purchase programme last month in response to the economic damage being wreaked by the global pandemic.\nThe ministers came close to a deal on less contentious issues, such as a \u20ac100bn job-support programme funded by EU borrowing on financial markets. There was also agreement that the EU\u2019s lending arm, the European Investment Bank, should provide loans worth \u20ac200bn to businesses, backed by \u20ac25bn of EU member state loan guarantees.\nMinisters did not discuss corona bonds directly \u2013 a tacit recognition of the deep divisions on this issue \u2013 but talked more generally about a recovery fund. While there was agreement on that general idea, ministers sidestepped the difficult question of how to finance it.\nAs countries look to their next move, France revealed it has not ruled out shared debt issuance with a smaller coalition of willing eurozone countries. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: That\u2019s not our wish. It\u2019s better to do this collectively,\u201d a French presidency official told Reuters in Paris.\nMinisters will attempt to agree a deal on Thursday but some diplomats remain sceptical an agreement is possible.\nThe European Trade Union Confederation called on European countries to redouble efforts to make a deal. \u201cI strongly urge finance ministers to reach an agreement. With more than 15 million workers who have already lost their jobs in Europe, working people cannot wait while the Eurogroup wrangles,\u201d the general secretary, Luca Visentini, said.",

Plus, first train in 11 weeks departs from former centre of outbreak in China\nGood morning, I\u2019m Mattha Busby with today\u2019s essential stories.\nNext week this briefing will look a little bit different, and be called First Thing. You don\u2019t need to do anything: it will still contain everything you need to know as you wake up, and be delivered every weekday morning. But now spring is here, we thought it was a good time to freshen it up, and we hope you like the changes as much as we do.\nDonald Trump has been desperately attempting to find a new scapegoat and shift blame from his role in initially downplaying the dangers of Covid-19 as the US death toll rose above 12,000. At the daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefing on Tuesday the president vowed to put a \u201cvery powerful hold\u201d on funding for the World Health Organization, which he claimed was biased towards China, before almost immediately backtracking and claiming he only said his administration would \u201clook at ending funding\u201d.\nNavarro memos. Americans would be left defenceless in the event of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak, which left unchecked could kill more than 1 million people in the US, warned Trump\u2019s economic adviser, Peter Navarro, privately in January and February.\nTough break. Trump lost an estimated $1bn from his paper fortune as the global lockdown brought his real estate-dominated empire to a near standstill and left his hotels, golf courses and shopping centres empty.\nDeaths from coronavirus in New York state now number 5,489 people, up 731 from a day earlier in the highest 24-hour increase since the crisis began in the hardest-hit state. The death toll in New York City has passed the 2,753 killed in the city during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the state was \u201creaching a plateau in the total number of hospitalizations\u201d and that officials would look ahead to restarting the economy, but stressed the need for continued physical distancing.\nThe curve. California officials have described a \u201cslow and steady increase\u201d in confirmed infections and predicted the state\u2019s outbreak would peak in the latter half of May, telling residents they should expect to stay indoors until June.\nMourning. John Prine, the folk and country singer, has died aged 73 due to complications from Covid-19, with Bruce Springsteen leading tributes to \u201ca true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages\u201d.\nHealthy residents of Wuhan are now allowed to travel in and out of the sprawling central Chinese city after outbound movement restrictions were lifted and trains began to depart once again on Wednesday morning from what had been the centre of the outbreak. Wuhan\u2019s unprecedented lockdown has been used as a model to battle coronavirus for other countries and attention will now turn to whether ordinary life can resume without a dramatic increase in new cases.\nJobs. The disruption wrought to the world\u2019s economies by the pandemic is expected to wipe out 6.7% of working hours globally in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the equivalent of 195m jobs, according to the UN\u2019s labour body.\nICU. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spent a third night in intensive care at a hospital in London, where he has required oxygen for breathing problems after contracting coronavirus.\nMasked. The World Health Organization has held off from recommending people wear face masks in public, saying there is no evidence that doing so prevents healthy people from contracting coronavirus.\nVoters in Wisconsin cast ballots in person on Tuesday in Democratic and local elections, after the governor tried to cancel in-person voting but was overruled by the state supreme court.\nThe former Republican congressman Paul Broun promised to give away an AR-15 rifle, which he described as a \u201cliberty machine\u201d, \u201cto one lucky person\u201d who signs up for his email updates as he vies for a return to Congress.\nTrump signed an executive order encouraging the US to mine the moon in a move that noted the US never signed a 1979 international agreement known as the moon treaty \u2013 raising the prospect of unilateral American moon drilling.\nA record-sized hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic in what is believed to be the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole, which are unrelated to Covid-19 and improved air quality.\nCoronavirus: 100 days that changed the world\nIt started with a warning on New Year\u2019s Eve when a Chinese government website announced the detection of a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d around a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, and it soon turned into a pandemic that has transformed life as we know it.\nIs meditation the key to surviving quarantine?\nThe ancient practice has been touted as being able to improve immune responses and decrease stress and depression, and Google searches for information are at an all-time high during the lockdown. So why not take a moment to connect with your breath?\nInside a rural hospital on the frontline of a pandemic\nSt James parish hospital outside New Orleans is used to enduring more than its fair share of disasters and it is now serving one of the hardest-hit counties nationwide for Covid-19 cases per capita: out of its 22,000 residents there have already been 175 confirmed cases and six deaths.\nTwin Peaks at 30: the weird and wonderful show that changed television\nFor cinephiles of a certain generation, the premiere of Twin Peaks on 8 April 1990 was a seismic event in popular culture, writes Scott Tobias, who describes viewing the first episode as an experience where you remember exactly where you were.\nA short-term collapse in global output is already under way and could exceed that of any recession in the last 150 years, writes the Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff, as he warns of a Covid-19 economic cataclysm.\nNow that the US has failed miserably to contain the outbreak despite having the world\u2019s most-advanced health system, Americans will find it exceedingly difficult to return to economic normality until a vaccine becomes widely available, which could be a year or more away.\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

        "content": "Officials raise concerns over domestic abuse during coronavirus outbreak\nChild protection referrals have plummeted by more than 50% in some areas of England, raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable children during the coronavirus outbreak.\nLocal authorities have reported dramatic falls in the number of children being referred to social services over child protection concerns, with social workers in one county in the south-east dealing with 25% of their normal daily level of referrals.\nReferrals are usually made by schools and health professionals, so with schools closed and children confined at home during the Covid-19 crisis, they are not coming into contact with the professionals who normally raise protection concerns.\nThere are also fears for children already known to be vulnerable, as they become less visible. The government had hoped to keep them in emergency schools, making places available for them alongside children of key workers, but attendance so far has been low, with as few as 5% turning up in some places.\nSchool staff and social workers are liaising with parents to encourage them to send their child to school, but they say families are choosing to keep children at home because they are worried about catching the virus. Others do not like the stigma of being seen as \u201cvulnerable\u201d, defined by government as a child with a social worker or an education, health and care plan for those with complex special educational needs.\nChildren\u2019s services directors contacted by the Guardian said they were concerned about the impact of domestic violence on children during the lockdown. Some reported a small increase in the number of young people reported missing, as teenagers struggle to observe the lockdown restrictions which may prevent them seeing friends and family.\nThe Children\u2019s Society has also warned that criminals involved in county lines drug trafficking could take advantage of the Covid-19 crisis to target children who are isolated from their usual support networks at school or college.\n\u201cThere will be a tremendous amount of unseen demand for child protection and for mental health issues,\u201d said Matt Dunkley, the corporate director of children\u2019s services in Kent. \u201cWe are currently seeing about 25% of our normal daily level of referrals. If professionals are not seeing these children, those referrals are not being made.\u201d\nLooking ahead to the end of the lockdown, Dunkley said: \u201cThe biggest challenge will be pent-up demand and how that pans out in whatever the exit from lockdown looks like. I expect demand will go through the roof.\u201d\nIn Kent, between 10% and 20% of vulnerable children eligible for a school place turned up for school the week before the Easter holidays. In Hertfordshire it was 12%. \u201cAfter Easter, after families have been together for a considerable amount of time, we are hopeful that the numbers will increase,\u201d said Jenny Coles, the director of children\u2019s services in Hertfordshire. \u201cSchools are a really important part of protecting children.\u201d\nIn Hertfordshire there has been a 50% decline in the number of referrals over the last week. \u201cIt\u2019s really important and we are concerned about it,\u201d said Coles, who is also president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services.\nShe said local authorities were prioritising face-to-face contact with those most at risk, but the usual routes of safeguarding referrals were inevitably affected by the lockdown.\n\u201cLocally systems are in place to ensure children are protected but now more than ever it\u2019s important that communities and neighbours are looking out for each other where possible, and if a family needs some additional help in these unprecedented times, contact should be made with the local authority as soon as possible so this can be arranged.\u201d\nThe government was unable to provide official data on school attendance by vulnerable children, but a spokesman said: \u201cBeing in school can keep vulnerable children safe and ease pressure on families, which is why we have enabled these children to continue attending despite schools being closed for other pupils.\u201d\nAs the lockdown continues, pressures on vulnerable families will increase. \u201cAt the moment, all things considered, everyone is behaving remarkably well,\u201d said Dunkley. \u201cThe longer lockdown goes on into the summer, the greater challenges it will pose to some of our young people.\u201d",

The coronavirus outbreak has forced many charities to concentrate their aid efforts elsewhere.\nDespite fears of the virus, migrants are still risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean: almost 800 people left Libya in March, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.\nIn March, Di Maio said during a conference call to the EU\u2019s foreign affairs council that the country was unable to open its ports to migrants. \u201cIt\u2019s not about wanting to be good or bad,\u201d said Di Maio. \u201cItaly can\u2019t just do it now.\u201d\nIn 2018 the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini declared Italy\u2019s ports \u201cclosed\u201d to migrant rescue ships, arguing that migrants represented a threat to national security.\nItaly has been one of Europe\u2019s worst-hit countries in the pandemic so far, with 135,586 coronavirus cases and 17,127 deaths.\n\u201cWe respect the national fate of all European countries fighting against this pandemic and especially the situation facing Italy,\u201d said Sea-Eye\u2019s mission manager, Jan Ribbeck.\n\u201cNo state in the Mediterranean should be left alone on the question of reception of refugees in the coronavirus crisis. We will address our flag state if it should become necessary.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Italy\u2019s public broadcaster RAI reported a claim that the NGO has \u2018\u2018already asked the German government to intervene by sending a plane to evacuate the 150 people on board\u201d.\nAccording to the NGO, at least 150 German cities are ready to welcome rescued migrants.\nIn the meantime, while Italian ministers were sending the decree to local authorities in order to inform them of the new government measures, two unescorted migrant boats with 124 people onboard arrived on the island of Lampedusa from Libya on Tuesday night.\nThe risk, according to charitable organisations, is that the Italian decree will send the migrant situation back years, when boats from Libya would set off on their own, risking people\u2019s lives in the attempt to reach Italian shores.\nAlarm Phone, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea, told the Guardian, \u201cWe are very concerned about the effects of the Italian decree and how European authorities are using the Covid-19 pandemic to increase restrictive measures. With Malta also decreasing rescue efforts, we are witnessing a deadly rescue gap off the Libyan coast.\u2019\u2019\nAlarm Phone fears that people fleeing from war and torture will be forced to navigate their boats over longer distances in order to reach European search and rescue. \u201cThis means that those trying to escape are at risk of drowning while at sea for days,\u201d Alarm Phone added. \u201cThese restrictive measures will lead to mass fatalities at sea as people will continue to migrate. They have no other option.\u201d\nThe migrants who arrived alone in the night were placed in quarantine in an area near the port of Lampedusa, inciting citizens who on Wednesday morning gathered in front of the mayor\u2019s office to protest against the decision to take in asylum seekers.",

A Facebook update from JimmyGreaves.net said: \u201cNo news is good news at the moment,\u201d and that Greaves had spoken via phone to his wife, Irene.\nThe post added: \u201cDuring the course of the day he will be having tests and when we find out the results I will post them on here.

However, he was left out of the 4-2 win against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, having lost his place earlier through injury.\nGreaves left Spurs for West Ham in 1969, with Martin Peters moving the other way, and later became a popular pundit.\nSpurs said in a statement: \u201cOur record goalscorer Jimmy Greaves is currently being treated in hospital.

Tens of thousands of bankrupt small businesses. Millions laid off. A stock market crash. No, this is not 2020. Yet. That was 2009, the time of our last Great Recession.\nAt that time, and despite many dubious decisions made by our country\u2019s banking leaders at the highest of levels that profited themselves at the expense of many others, the federal government saw fit to bail out those same parties with billions of dollars of taxpayer money in order to save our economy. The CEOs of those banks accepted those funds and used them to wipe away their past sins and get themselves back on sounder footing.\nFast-forward 11 years and our country now grapples with another economic disaster, this time brought on by a worldwide viral pandemic. Our government, in order to save millions of small businesses that face financial ruin caused by forced closings and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, has approved $350bn to aid those flailing businesses.\nIn order to get this money to as many businesses as fast as possible, the government decides to use federally insured financial institutions, and seeks to particularly lean on the already established Small Business Administration (SBA) and its vast network of member banks. They do this with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was part of a $2.2tn stimulus bill and was designed to help small businesses keep staff on their payrolls.\n\u201cJust loan these desperate small businesses money,\u201d the government tells these banks. \u201cWe\u2019ll guarantee it, and even forgive it.\u201d\nYou would think \u2013 particularly as medical, police, firefighters, let alone grocery clerks \u2013 are literally risking their lives to do their part in these terrifying times, the bankers of this country would see this as an opportunity to step up and pay it forward themselves. They would leap at the chance to help all those small businesses that they\u2019ve been courting on television, radio and online all these years.\nAnd some banks \u2013 particularly smaller, independent banks, not to mention credit unions \u2013 have done just that. They were the first to process loan applications for their struggling small business customers last Friday when the SBA opened their loan window.\nAnd then there\u2019s Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other large banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup who have all said \u201cnot so fast\u201d. These banks last week, at such a critical moment, gathered together and decided to slow things down. They limited loans only to customers and credit card holders. They came up with \u201cnew\u201d lending requirements and asked for more documentation over and above SBA guidelines. They capped the amount of loans they would make. The rules aren\u2019t clear, they cried, and we have to work harder!\n\u201cAre you kidding me @BankofAmerica,\u201d Melissa Perri, a CEO, tweeted. \u201cWith this requirement of having a credit card to apply for the PPP? What type of scam is this? I have been a loyal customer for years with my business accounts. #bankofamerica #PPPloan\u201d\n\u201c#bankofamerica I have been a business customer for 17 Years,\u201d complained Eric Martel, an entrepreneur. \u201cI tried to apply for SBA Paycheck Protection to pay for employees and they denied me. Looking for another bank.\u201d\nThe outrage made #bankofamerica a trending hashtag on Twitter that day and sparked the Republican senator Marco Rubio, a prominent member of the team that crafted the Paycheck Protection Act, to voice his concern, tweeting that \u201cThis is a @BankofAmerica, requirement not a govt one. They should drop it. This money is 100% guaranteed by fed govt.\u201d\nSo shame on Bank of America, right? Well, yes. But I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the only problem.\nChoosing to only favor customers over everyone else, requiring excessive documentation or capping loans was a bad and misguided decision. Publicly complaining was a bad PR move. Not being more proactive in the weeks they had to prepare was poor planning.\nBut in their defense, Bank of America and other big banks have been loaning lots of money under the stimulus program. There were technical problems with the SBA loan system. The rules from the SBA and Treasury were unclear and placed a few too many burdens on the lender. Some banks \u2013 like Wells Fargo \u2013 were subject to federally mandated loan caps as a result of their past reprehensible behavior. Banks do have an obligation to their shareholders and customers \u2013 and the economy as a whole \u2013 to keep watch on their balance sheets. They are notoriously conservative (except when they\u2019re not, like in the years preceding 2009), and we want them to be that way.\nThe good news is that the treasury department just issued additional guidelines for lenders this week and key policymakers like Rubio are pushing through more changes to make the stimulus plan \u2013 for which he contributed so much \u2013 a success. He posted a series of tweets on Monday that addressed his concerns including the Federal Reserve\u2019s intention to \u201chelp clear up more space on lender balance sheets to issue #PPPloans by either making #PPP more attractive to secondary market buyers, or by buying #PPP loans from lenders directly\u201d.\nRegardless, the behavior of these banks does not surprise me.\nI hate to say I told you so, but I did see this this coming last week when I wrote here that \u201cfor some of them [banks], this stimulus bill is a potential hassle \u2026 it\u2019s just a pain in the neck and may not be worth all the headaches.\u201d\nI believe that\u2019s what really going on at Bank of America and its fellow big lenders. They\u2019re looking at this program not as an opportunity to grow their small business lending practices (like many smart smaller banks and credit unions) but as a burden, a hassle and a distraction from what really makes them money: their big business customers. I hope I\u2019m wrong about this. But if I\u2019m right \u2013 and I believe I am \u2013 then that\u2019s the real reason why they should be ashamed of themselves.",

The first is those in the heart of this crisis. The prime minister fighting for his life. The heroic out-of-retirement doctors going back and not returning. The underpaid nurses leaving behind families. The care workers, the bus drivers, the victims \u2013 those final breaths surrounded by ventilator machines and masks instead of wives, husbands and children. The news. The three lecterns, the Skyping journalists, the sheer numbers lost \u2013 they start to become almost meaningless when they get so high.\nThe second world is the rest of us. The lucky ones. Untouched directly \u2013 so far. Each with our own petty lockdown frustrations. Zooming permanently out\u2011of\u2011shot parents, dodging joggers who hurtle round blind corners, the endless washing-up. Eye-rolling at people out in parks complaining about other people who are out in parks.\nAnd in the middle of all of it is football just not quite getting it right. As someone put it so perfectly the other day, football is being used as, well, a political football \u2013 amplified even more than normal by social media as we have nothing to do but scroll, refresh, scroll, refresh until our allotted outside time. Twitter bios updated to read: \u201cProud Dad, amateur virologist, keen interest in Football Finance specifically in times of a Global Pandemic.\u201d Everyone is losing at the moment. The Football Association, the Premier League, the EFL, the broadcasters, the players, the fans. Some maybe more than others, but no one benefits.\nThis is the weirdest and most complex situation of our lifetime, none of us know what is going to happen \u2013 and that includes owners, players, broadcasters, MPs \u2026 all of us. Surely we are all going to get it wrong at some point. That doesn\u2019t mean giving people a free pass but it does mean patience, flexibility and understanding: three words seemingly absent from the debate.\nUntil a month ago I would have guessed a reverse furlough was something Jos Buttler might pull out in the IPL. Liverpool\u2019s about-turn appears correct. Is it too simple to suggest that every pound the government puts into furlough is taken away from purchasing or building ventilators or PPE equipment? Probably. But it\u2019s another pound the government won\u2019t have.\nLiverpool are a business with rich owners and not too many staff \u2013 they can afford it, in a way that perhaps Norwich and Bournemouth can\u2019t. They deserve credit for changing their mind. It\u2019s OK to screw up and admit your mistake. If \u2013 as some seem desperate to see \u2013 you want a league table of who deserves praise right now then they finish below Leeds and the Manchester clubs and above Tottenham and Newcastle. But ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter. They no longer have the government\u2019s money. Park that and let\u2019s move on to the next thing.\nThe question about whether it\u2019s fair for some clubs to furlough when others don\u2019t appears legitimate. And where do you draw the acceptable line \u2013 above or below Newcastle? The answer is more complex. It is going to be different for every club in the pyramid. There won\u2019t be a line. Some League Two clubs won\u2019t need to; some Premier League clubs will.\nAnd what of Spurs? You have to hand it to them for continuing their dismal form even when football has completely stopped. Furloughing staff while players run arm in arm in a park in Barnet. Even former players (Kyle Walker) and players who haven\u2019t joined yet (Jack Grealish) are getting involved in damaging the brand.\nJoe Lewis is a billionaire. Daniel Levy is paid millions of pounds. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters\u2019 Trust put out a very sensible and measured statement asking for an explanation, and followed up saying: \u201cDo not further damage the club\u2019s reputation, listen to your fans.\u201d Surely there was a meeting where Spurs weighed up both options. Now is the time to be crystal clear \u2013 if stadium debt, or whatever, is an issue, then be open about it.\nSome fans have threatened to give up on their club. Is that even possible? Could you give up on your football team? Surely the subconscious will take over when Hugo Lloris leads them out for their next Premier League game behind closed doors on a training ground in the Midlands?\nWhat about the broadcasters? They are due \u00a3762m back if the season isn\u2019t completed. Do they need that money? All of it? Straight away? With no live sport, their subscription numbers will decrease, not to mention the loss of advertising revenue and sponsorship around live games. Everyone loses.\nAnd what of the players? The last few days have made us realise that they might actually be like a large group of real humans \u2013 different, impossible to cover with just one label. Most with good intentions, engaged, thoughtful and in touch. A few less so. And while thousands of people who aren\u2019t being asked to give up their wages ask footballers to give up theirs, surely it\u2019s OK for those footballers to at least spend a bit of time working out exactly where their money might go.\nOf course at the very moment footballers seemed to be winning the PR battle, Walker picked a pursuit completely unachievable while maintaining physical distancing. But others, like Jordan Henderson and Marcus Rashford, are going above and beyond. Footballers leading the way. It\u2019s refreshing.\nThe truth is that football \u2013 like the rest of society \u2013 is struggling to work out how to proceed. So many vested interests, all wanting to do the right thing, but trying to protect themselves at the same time, which is probably what we\u2019re all doing right now.\nPerhaps I am the only hypocrite. Because while I\u2019ve tweeted Spurs telling them not to take the government\u2019s money, I\u2019ve just bought an exercise bike from a tax-avoiding delivery company. I despair at those stockpiling, but when there was no hand sanitiser three weeks ago I ordered 10 bottles online that have just arrived. (I will give most of them away.) We are all going to get things wrong.\nAnd football is no different. Perhaps the key is to realise that some will get more help than others, that it won\u2019t be exactly fair, and no one will get it right all of the time. It never was and they never did.",

He received only a standard email response and resorted to coordinating the flight with his wife, Karen Lewis.\nAfter contacting other stranded travellers through a Facebook group, they managed to bring 103 people back to Heathrow on 28 March. Tickets, which cost about \u00a31,000, were offered on a first-come-first-served basis.\nAbout 250 tourists, including young backpackers and retirees, are understood to remain stuck in Cambodia, while tens of thousands more Britons are still scattered around the world.\nLast week, the government pledged \u00a375m to charter special flights to \u201cpriority countries\u201d, and provide affordable seats on commercial airlines. Planes have been chartered to Peru, India, South Africa and Nepal, but many travellers stuck in countries where commercial airlines are still operating are yet to benefit.\nIn Cambodia, the British embassy has continued to advise people to book commercial flights over the past week, even though these cost thousands of pounds and have repeatedly been cancelled, with passengers unable to secure quick refunds. On Tuesday the British embassy began surveying interest for a commercial flight leaving on 13 April, though officials say it will only go ahead if it is commercially viable. There is a possibility of financial support, travellers were told, but the details are unclear.\nLewis questioned why he and his wife, private citizens, had been able to organise a flight more quickly than embassy staff for roughly the same price. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the French, the Germans, the Swiss getting repatriated and I see British people still stuck there and being told to book commercial flights \u2013 the same advice \u2013 when they\u2019ve already booked two, three, four, five, some even six commercial flights and they\u2019ve lost all their money,\u201d said Lewis.\nHe fears some people won\u2019t be able to afford the embassy flight because they are still awaiting refunds. In total, it has cost his family of five about \u00a311,000 to get home.\nWhile the number of coronavirus cases recorded in Cambodia was low and travellers were safe, the global crisis was moving rapidly, he added, and it was possible the situation there might change. \u201cThe government might have a state of emergency, they could make any rule \u2013 they could shut shops, shut hotels, stop all flights. It\u2019s the anxiety, the not knowing,\u201d he said.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cOur consular teams are doing everything they can, especially for those in difficulty, to keep Brits informed on the latest developments and help them return \u2013 on commercial flights where they are still available or special charter flights as well. We\u2019ll continue working around the clock to bring people home.\u201d",

This case is only the second time such an order has been used in Britain.\nOn Wednesday, a high court judge granted an application to discharge the unexplained wealth orders.\nThe NCA said it would appeal against the decision.\nOne of the properties, a mansion in Hampstead, is occupied by Nurali Aliyev, the grandson of former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and his wife and children.\nThe two other properties frozen are an apartment in Chelsea, south-west London, which the campaign group Transparency International says is worth \u00a331m, and a house in Highgate, north London.\nThe NCA has barred any attempt to sell the properties and argues that the wealth used to buy them was linked to Rakhat Aliyev \u2013 Nurali Aliyev\u2019s father and the former president\u2019s son-in-law \u2013 who was found hanged in an Austrian jail in 2015 after being charged with the murder of two bankers in 2007.\n\u201cUWOs are new legislation and we always expected there would be significant legal challenge over their use,\u201d said Graeme Biggar, the NCA\u2019s director general of the National Economic Crime Centre.\n\u201cWe disagree with this decision to discharge the UWOs and will be filing an appeal. We have been very clear that we will use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance and we will continue to do so.\u201d\nThe ultimate beneficial owners of the three properties \u2014 Rakhat Aliyev\u2019s ex-wife, Dariga Nazarbayeva, the chair of the senate in Kazakhstan and daughter of the former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and her son, Nurali Aliyev \u2014 applied to the high court to discharge the UWOs.\nGiving judgment remotely on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Lang overturned all three UWOs, ruling that \u201cthe NCA\u2019s assumption\u201d that Rakhat Aliyev was the source of the funds to purchase the three properties was unreliable.\nThe judge said there was \u201ccogent evidence\u201d that Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev had founded the companies that owned the properties and provided the funds to purchase them.\n\u201cThe court\u2019s powerful judgment demonstrates the NCA obtained the orders on an inaccurate basis as part of a flawed investigation which was entirely without merit,\u201d said Nurali Aliyev.\nBritain\u2019s first UWOs were issued against assets belonging to Jahangir Hajiyev, who was in prison in Azerbaijan for embezzlement from the state bank, and his wife, Zamira, who spent \u00a316.3m in the London department store Harrods.

        "content": "Brussels agency accuses Mauro Ferrari of being \u2018at best economical with truth\u2019 in resignation statement\nThe EU\u2019s former top scientist has been accused by the Brussels agency he led of being \u201cat best economical with the truth\u201d over claims in his resignation statement that he had been blocked from funding treatments and vaccines to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn an extraordinary row that highlights the tensions being wrought within the EU\u2019s institutions by the health crisis, the board of the European Research council issued a damning statement about the man they chose to lead them three months ago.\nThe ERC\u2019s scientific council said Mauro Ferrari resigned on Tuesday evening and made his damaging claims after being told to leave by the 19-strong board on Friday.\nThe council went on to say that the Italian scientist had not engaged sufficiently with his job, spent too much time in America where he had a laboratory, and had gone over the heads of the ERC board to talk to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.\nThe ERC is the EU\u2019s chief funder of scientists seeking breakthroughs at the very frontiers of knowledge. Since its establishment in 2007, it has helped seven researchers win Nobel prizes. Ferrari, one of the world\u2019s leading nanoscientists, was three months into a four-year tenure but had been given permission to carry on with his research in the US on cancer treatments, as in line with previous arrangements with the organisation\u2019s presidents.\nFerrari, who revealed in January in the Guardian he had retrained at the age of 43 to become a doctor and then a medical researcher after his first wife died from cancer, said he had joined the ERC believing he could help the funding agency serve \u201cthe needs of the world\u201d.\nBut in his resignation announcement on Tuesday night, Ferrari had said he had become \u201cdeeply disappointed and disturbed\u201d by the EU\u2019s reaction to what he described as a \u201ca tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions\u201d.\n\u201cIn time of emergencies people, and institutions, revert to their deepest nature and reveal their true character,\u201d Ferrari wrote.\nFerrari said his \u201cidealistic motivations were crushed by a very different reality\u201d. A proposal he had made in early March in Brussels to establish a special programme directed at combating Covid-19 was \u201cunanimously rejected\u201d by the ERC\u2019s governing body, he wrote.\nLater attempts to fund the best scientists following discussions with Von der Leyen herself had also \u201cdisintegrated upon impact\u201d with the layers of European commission bureaucracy, Ferrari said.\n\u201cI believed this [programme] justified by the expected burden of death, suffering, societal transformation, and economic devastation, especially striking the less fortunate, the weakest in the societies of the world,\u201d Ferrari wrote. \u201cI thought that at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic.\u201d\nFerrari said his proposal had been rejected on the grounds that the ERC\u2019s role was to fund from the \u201cbottom up\u201d rather than dictate the areas where scientists should focus.\nIn response, the scientific council of the ERC claimed Ferrari had not understood his role and had \u201cdisplayed a lack of engagement with the ERC, failing to participate in many important meetings, spending extensive time in the USA and failing to defend the ERC\u2019s programme and mission when representing the ERC\u201d.\n\u201cIn contrast, Professor Ferrari made several personal initiatives within the commission, without consulting or tapping into the collective knowledge of the Scientific Council, and instead using his position to promote his own ideas\u201d, the ERC statement said.\nThe ERC said Ferrari\u2019s proposal had been rejected as it was outside the remit of the agency and that \u201chis resignation in fact followed a written unanimous vote of no confidence\u201d.\nFerrari said Von der Leyen had \u201cpersonally reached out asking for my input on how the pandemic might be addressed\u201d. But his contact with the commission president had \u201ccreated an internal political thunderstorm\u201d and his plans came to nothing, he added.\nFerrari wrote that more broadly the EU had failed to live up to its ideals in dealing with coronavirus, with member states failing to offer aid to the countries most affected, including Italy, when it was needed most.\nIn the latest development, finance ministers failed on Tuesday evening to come to agreement on how they would fund the rebuilding of the European economy, with the richer northern states resisting plans for new instruments that would make borrowing on the financial markets cheaper for the south and more expensive for them.\nFerrari wrote that he had been extremely disappointed by the European response to Covid-19 and that he \u201clost faith in the system itself\u201d.",

The state\u2019s governor, a Democrat, moved at the last minute to cancel in-person voting and to mail a ballot to every voter. But Republicans, who control the state legislature, refused. There were long lines in Milwaukee on Tuesday as the city had to consolidate its polling places after poll workers dropped out over concerns about their health.\nVoter fraud in the US is extremely rare, but Republicans have long used it to justify restrictions on voting rights. Five states in the country conduct their elections entirely by mail and have developed systems to preserve the integrity of ballots. Nonetheless, Trump, who voted in Florida with a mail-in ballot in March, has repeatedly spoken out at his daily White House briefing against efforts to make it easier to vote by mail so that people don\u2019t have to risk their health to vote.\nLast week, he dismissed Democratic efforts in Congress making it easier to vote in the coronavirus era. Trump said the move would make it so \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d.\nDuring his White House briefing on Tuesday, Trump defended the fact that he voted by mail in Florida\u2019s March primary, saying it was acceptable for him to do it because he was out of the state.\n\u201cI\u2019m allowed to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between somebody that\u2019s out of state and does a ballot and everything is sealed, certified and everything else.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump was referring to. Florida allows people to vote by mail regardless of whether they are in the state or not. Trump also falsely said that \u201cyou get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody\u2019s living room, signing ballots all over the place\u201d.\nColorado, one of the states that uses all vote-by-mail, has a Republican US senator.\nRepublican officials in other states are also pushing voters to cast ballots by mail. In Georgia, the Republican secretary of state is mailing a voter registration form to all active registered voters in the state. Echoing Trump, the speaker of the Georgia house of representatives, a Republican, said expanding mail-in voting \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives\u201d. He later claimed he was referring to the potential for fraud.\nIn Ohio, Republicans who control the legislature approved a plan to go to an all-mail election on 28 April after the governor cancelled in-person voting in March.",

        "content": "Findings from Bolivia show plants were domesticated in region shortly after last ice age\nThe Amazon basin was a hotspot for the early cultivation of plants, with inhabitants having munched on squash and cassava more than 10,000 years ago, researchers have revealed.\nThe team say the new findings from Bolivia offer direct evidence such plants were grown in south-west Amazonia, meaning the region has a claim to join the Middle East, China, south-west Mexico and north-west South America as locations where wild plants were domesticated shortly after the last ice age. The team say the discovery chimes with other clues.\n\u201c[Previous work] identified south-west Amazonia as a potential centre of domestication because in this area they found a lot of wild relatives of domesticated plants,\u201d said Dr Umberto Lombardo of the University of Bern, a co-author of the research.\nWriting in the journal Nature, Lombardo and colleagues reveal how they made their discovery after investigating \u201cforest islands\u201d \u2013 raised, wooded areas, about 70 meters in diameter \u2013 within savanna in Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia.\nUsing a range of sources, including Google Earth, the team report more than 6,600 forest islands in Llanos de Moxos, adding that they looked at the makeup of soil samples at 82 of the sites, finding more than 60 showed telltale signs of human occupation \u2013 such as charcoal, shells and bone fragments. From these findings, the team estimated at least 4,700 of the \u201cforest islands\u201d identified were sites where humans once lived \u2013 and chucked their waste.\n\u201cThey are places where people just threw their rubbish after eating or whatever they did,\u201d said Lombardo, noting the accumulation went on for thousands of years, resulting in a raised platform that, safe from the savannah\u2019s seasonal floods, eventually became colonised by trees.\nFurther analysis, using radiocarbon dating of charcoal or shell fragments within samples from 31 of the sites, reveal human occupation dating as far back as 10,850 years ago \u2013 shortly after the end of the last ice age, when cultivation of plants began independently in various regions of the world.\nLombardo and colleagues then examined tiny particles of silica that were found alongside the material for dating. These particles, called phytoliths, form in plant tissues with phytoliths from different types of plants, and sometimes even different species, showing particular shapes.\n\u201cPhytoliths are plant microfossils,\u201d said Lombardo. \u201cAnd we can use them to identify the plants that lived in that place in the past.\u201d\nThe team report a heart-shaped phytolith that came from cassava at one site, in a sample dating to about 10,350 years ago, with scalloped, spherical phytoliths from the rind of squash plants found in samples dating as far back as 10,250 years ago.\nAmong other discoveries, the researchers found phytoliths from maize that date as far back as 6,850 years ago.\nThe team said the plants had probably been cultivated in home gardens. But whether the plants were domesticated there \u2013 a process involving selection of particular traits \u2013 or were already semi-domesticated is less clear.\nLombardo also cautioned that not all plants form phytoliths \u2013 among them are peanuts, which evidence from wild plants in the region suggests come from the south-west of the Amazon basin.\nDr Sarah Elliott, an environmental archaeologist from the University of Bournemouth, who was not involved in the research, said the study was significant, noting the team had found the oldest evidence for squash associated directly with human activity and the earliest maize cultivation in the Amazon basin.\n\u201cThe human impact in the Amazon in the past was thought to be minimal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut new research such as this study demonstrates that the nature of human occupation and alteration of the landscape is extensive, and this region now has evidence for the implementation of cultivation from as far back as 10,250 years [ago].\u201d",

        "content": "Radiocarbon test of early Neolithic remains can pinpoint dates to a human life span 5,500 years ago\nIt is perhaps best-known for its hipsters, but long before Shoreditch became avant garde, it was a place of agriculture and farmers according to evidence from a radiocarbon dating technique that has revealed details about Neolithic London.\nThe technique proved that the most significant early Neolithic pottery discovered in London is 5,500 years old. It reveals for the first time that the city\u2019s prehistoric inhabitants led a less mobile, farming-based lifestyle than their hunter-gathering forebears.\nThe research, published in Nature, reveals that an area around Shoreditch High Street was once populated by farmers herding their livestock across a once-green landscape. They were possibly linked to migrant groups who first introduced farming to Britain from continental Europe around 4,000 BC.\nJon Cotton, a consultant prehistorian working for MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology), said: \u201cThis remarkable collection helps to fill a critical gap in London\u2019s prehistory. Archaeological evidence for the period after farming arrived in Britain rarely survives in the capital, let alone still in-situ. This is the strongest evidence yet that people in the area later occupied by the city and its immediate hinterland were living a less mobile, farming-based lifestyle during the early Neolithic period.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt seems quite likely that these people were semi-nomadic, but settling from time to time in various spots and very much geared around the herding of animals.\u201d\nThe technique, developed by scientists at the University of Bristol, is so accurate that it can pinpoint dates to a human life span. It has enabled fatty residues absorbed within the porous walls of the prehistoric pots to be extracted and analysed.\nThe study of long-expired milk fats and other microscopic food remains confirms they once held cattle and sheep or goat dairy products, including butter and cheese. Such foodstuffs could easily be stored during winter months. There was also evidence of stewed meat, including beef and mutton.\nAlthough the pottery is now in hundreds of fragments, some still bear the fingertip impressions of their original creators.\nThe collection was discovered by archaeologists from MOLA while excavating the site of a Roman cemetery at Principal Place, an extensive development in Shoreditch.\nProf Richard Evershed, who headed the University of Bristol team, said: \u201cBeing able to directly date archaeological pots is one of the \u2018Holy Grails\u2019 of archaeology. This new method is based on an idea I had going back more than 20 years \u2026 We made several earlier attempts to get the method right, but it wasn\u2019t until we established our own radiocarbon facility in Bristol that we cracked it.\u201d\nEvidence of early Neolithic houses have been found at Horton in Berkshire, Cranford in Hounslow, and Gorhambury in the Colne Valley, and archaeologists believe the pottery from Principal Place suggests a similarly significant settlement.\nJudging from those slightly earlier sites, Cotton said the people who created the Principal Place pottery might also have lived in substantial houses made of timber with thatched roofs.\nNoting that the pot residues include herding animals, he added that today\u2019s crowded urban site of Shoreditch High Street was once the upper part of the Walbrook Valley, close to running fresh water and immediate resources for flocks and herds. He said: \u201cYou might have to imagine some small clearing within a wooded environment. It was a good place to live.\u201d\nPrevious Neolithic remains discovered in urban central London barely extend beyond a few fragments of pottery and stone axes.\nCotton said: \u201cSo this site provides the first solid evidence for the presence of people within the area of the city and its immediate environs. This is the largest group of prehistoric pottery in situ from that area. You can count the amount of prehistoric pottery from the city hitherto on the fingers of virtually one hand.\u201d\nThe pottery features 436 fragments from at least 24 separate vessels. Some had been decorated by pressing fingertips or roe deer hooves into the clay \u2013 revealing that, even at this early date, people cared about the look as well as the function of their tableware.",

The Earth Summit was being held in Rio and Tristan, whose responsibilities included Latin America as well as Europe, persuaded his good friend to visit Colombia on the way.\nThe visit, in the times of the drug baron Pablo Escobar, was seen as a splendid gesture by the Colombians and transformed our relationship. It was part of a boost to our relations with Latin America as a whole that Tristan inspired. Latin American leaders had never met a British politician who spoke Spanish as well as them and also knew and loved the region so well. He was very popular indeed. He himself convinced members of the cabinet to visit the region, which they did in unprecedented numbers.\nOne result was a British-Latin-American trade meeting in the Banqueting Hall, Westminster, in 1997 four years after Tristan\u2019s retirement. It was attended by three presidents and many ministers from Latin America, the prime minister and six members of the British cabinet. He put everyone at ease with his jokes, switching from English to Spanish and back, even using some Portuguese, as relaxed as if it was a gathering of friends, which, of course, for him it was. I cannot think of any British minister who could have put on such an international show.\nHe told me that his Latin American visits, which he so enjoyed, helped to keep him sane during the grind of the Maastricht legislation. I was so glad to see him still on good form during the state visit of President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia in 2016: Santos as trade minister and old London hand had organised the Major visit a generation before.

Back in the 2005 Big Cup he famously turned a laundry basket into a Trojan horse, albeit one that was smuggled into his own team\u2019s dressing room rather than into the enemy camp, jumping out and slaughtering unsuspecting Bayern Munich players not being an option that even he was willing to consider. Credit where it\u2019s due.\nBefore that, and very many times since that, Mourinho has expertly used interviews to cover up lame performances, sending unsuspecting hacks on wild goose chase after wild goose chase by talking pure, honed bull.

Many designers are finding themselves with unsold stock or excess material, as well as overheads such as studio rent which can\u2019t be paid. \u201cThe supply chain has stopped, so everything\u2019s stopped,\u201d says Ahluwalia.\nIt is a similar story for the London based designer Feng Chen Wang, who was born in China. Currently quarantined in Shanghai, she says that the pandemic has affected three seasons, as her label produces mainly in China. \u201cFirst, SS20 was affected by the Chinese New Year closures that started in January, then, once the virus took hold and stores started closing, it meant they reduced SS20 deliveries. Then they reduced all forward orders for AW20,\u201d she says. \u201cNow China is slowly returning to work, but our European suppliers are still closed.\u201d\nShe adds that many of her work plans have been derailed. \u201cWe were planning a new and exciting way to launch SS21 to market, which is now postponed. Our special collaboration projects have also been postponed. We had planned to open our own pop-up stores in London and New York, which now won\u2019t happen until much later in the year.\u201d\nTo alleviate some of the pressure, the BFC has launched the BFC Foundation Fashion Fund (the deadline to apply is 13 April). Once applications close, it will allocate \u00a31m to the designer businesses that meet the criteria. Simultaneously, the BFC is actively fundraising and once it has raised \u00a3500,000, it will reopen applications to allocate this additional sum. Rush hopes the government and big businesses will get behind the initiative and supplement the financial contribution.\nHack goes further: he wants the government to make interest-free loans of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a325,000 available to struggling freelancers via banks. \u201cThey need to give the creative industries this life support, and it needs to be immediate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government needs to give housing benefit and protection from eviction for a minimum of six months on top of UBI (universal basic income).\u201d\nFashion has been quick to respond to the pandemic, pivoting away from clothes manufacturing and towards helping with the medical crisis. It was announced last Saturday that Burberry would be helping make protective gowns for NHS workers, while LVMH has repurposed its fragrance factories to make 12 tonnes of hand sanitiser for 39 hospitals in France. While big brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent are producing masks and overalls. Ralph Lauren meanwhile has donated $10m to corona-related causes. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of how fashion has come through for the most vulnerable and needy with cash and resources,\u201d says Hack.\nMost recently Bethany Williams, Phoebe English and Holly Fulton have formed the Emergency Designer Network, which is helping the NHS with gown and mask production in response to the BFC\u2019s request for support. \u201cWe are aiming to bring together an initial network of 10 designers and makers across London who could support in the small-scale manufacturing of medical garments and face masks for medical teams, social careers and various support staff and key workers.\u201d says Williams. Hack describes them as \u201ca Dunkirk-like small flotilla of young designers\u201d.\nWith many of June\u2019s fashion weeks now cancelled, Rush admits she is unsure what the future holds. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to imagine what a new normal will be,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter what we do, some business will go.\u201d",

Research by Dr Daniel Allington, senior lecturer in social and cultural artificial intelligence at King\u2019s College London, suggested there was a statistically notable link between people who believed false claims about the coronavirus and people who were willing to flout the government\u2019s social distancing guidelines.\nHis findings, based on a experimental study conducted in coordination with the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, found that people who said they believed coronavirus was connected to 5G mobile phone masts are less likely to be staying indoors, washing their hands regularly or respecting physical distancing.\nWhile social media platforms have moved faster than in the past to flag disinformation about coronavirus on public groups, prominent actors and entertainers with millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram have helped fan the flames of misinformation, often reaching vastly more people than mainstream news outlets.\n\u201cThis small amount of people have a wide reach for the content that they are spreading,\u201d said Scott Brennen, a research fellow at the Reuters Institute. \u201cThe most common claims had to do with the policies and actions of public authorities, although we saw plenty of misinformation about the medical side.\u201d\nHe said research into coronavirus disinformation almost certainly underestimated the enormous role played by WhatsApp because there are few ways for researchers to build an accurate picture of how material is spreading on the Facebook-owned service.\nIn one example on Wednesday the South East Coast Ambulance Service was forced to issue a statement about a fake voicemail message going viral on the service. It purported to be from someone who works at the service claiming falsely that ambulances would not make callouts to people at home suffering from Covid-19, that ice rinks were being used as makeshift morgues, and that a third of the deaths in coming weeks would be babies, children and teenagers with no underlying health issues.\nThe service said: \u201cThe alarmist information being shared in the message is not correct. We would urge people to disregard the message and not share it further.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Martin Belam\nCelebrities who have drawn criticism for spreading coronavirus disinformation\nThe British singer, who is also an opponent of vaccination programmes, has posted a series of tweets criticising engineers installing fibre broadband outside her London home while suggesting the supposed \u201csymptoms\u201d of being near 5G base stations were similar to those of coronavirus.\nPeople in England are setting fire to it. They should just turn it off till after the pandemic! pic.twitter.com/Hy1BPsLHse\nThe lauded actor, who starred in Cheers and True Detective, has shared a series of posts to his Instagram page making baseless claims linking the coronavirus outbreak to the installation of 5G equipment in Chinese cities.\nIn a post on Instagram that combined many of the most popular coronavirus conspiracies in a single medley, the British boxer claimed that coronavirus was man-made \u2013 designed to cull the world\u2019s population \u2013 and said the lockdown was used to provide cover for the rollout of 5G.",

The capacity to carry out work is 25% of what it would usually be.\nThe leaked letter from Michael Clauss, the German ambassador to the EU, to his political bosses in Berlin said a range of issues not key to rebuilding from the pandemic would need to be sidelined as a result.\nAn EU official said while the European commission, which is in charge of talks with the UK, had better facilities for remote negotiation, it would be impossible for the member states to have the same input through the EU council. This would make a successful negotiation nearly impossible.\nThe December timeline for agreeing a deal with the EU \u201cwhich was already hopelessly optimistic\u201d was described as \u201clike fantasy land\u201d, by one source. The UK can agree with the EU to extend the transition period by up to one or two years, if necessary, but Downing Street insisted it would not do so.\nThe planned schedule of negotiating rounds on the future relationship was abandoned after the first week due to the pandemic. The UK\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost, will speak to his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, next week to try to agree a new timetable and method for the talks.\nBarnier is recovering after contracting coronavirus but Johnson remains in intensive care with the disease.\nGermany takes over the rolling EU presidency on 1 July from Croatia. It will be responsible for chairing key meetings and finding compromise positions on issues, including Brexit.\nHowever, the German ambassador to the EU wrote that it would not be possible to look beyond the need to rebuild the EU economy.\nHe said: \u201cFrom now on, the focus will be on the ability of the European institutions to act, crisis management, exit and reconstruction \u2013 possibly maintaining the EU integration itself. The success of our presidency will be measured against this.\u201d\nClauss said other key issues would \u201cinevitably be overlaid or completely receded\u201d as the EU\u2019s ability to act will \u201cremain broadly limited until further notice\u201d, according to the letter leaked to German magazine Der Spiegel.\nDue to physical distancing rules, which are likely to remain even when lockdowns across Europe are lifted, the usual 21 boardrooms available for internal negotiations will be reduced to five. These will have to be shared with the EU\u2019s foreign affairs wing, the European External Action Service.\n\u201cThe council secretariat strongly recommends planning only with one video conference per day,\u201d the letter said. It added that the EU was having to use a commercially available end-to-end encryption service.\nFour new video conferencing systems set up in the European parliament are also said not to meet the required level of confidentiality.\nThe ambassador wrote: \u201cVideo conferences, even if they can be carried out, will not be able to replace physical meetings on an equal footing. No formal quorum, no marginalised conversations, no confidentiality of the negotiations, no interpreting. Difficulties in text work.\u201d\nA UK government spokesman said: \u201cWe remain fully committed to the negotiations and as we have been clear, discussions with the commission are continuing, with the aim of reaching an agreement by the end of the year. The transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in EU law, which the Prime Minister has made clear he has no intention of changing.\u201d",

This week analysts estimated that Channel 4 had the finances to survive for only six months without making cuts.\nChannel 4\u2019s management, including the chief executive, Alex Mahon, and director of programmes, Ian Katz, are to take a 20% pay cut and will not receive bonuses this year. The broadcaster also announced that 10% of its more than 900 staff are to be furloughed.\n\u201cAs a commercially funded business, the Covid-19 outbreak has had a severe impact on our advertising revenues,\u201d Mahon said. \u201cAnd so we are taking action now to manage our costs appropriately and ensure that we both protect our staff and our ongoing ability to serve our audience.\u201d\nThe broadcaster intends to cut \u00a3150m from its \u00a3660m programming budget, representing nearly a quarter of its spend. It admitted that it would mean fewer new shows on screen this year, with the filming of the next series of The Great British Bake Off paused because of coronavirus.\n\u201cThis will reflect both the delay of programmes which have been unable to be produced due to the circumstances and a number of shows which will regrettably have to be cancelled,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThis will impact the whole portfolio with a number of new shows on E4 also postponed or cancelled.\u201d\nChannel 4 is seeking to make \u00a395m in additional savings, including through a hiring freeze, cutting its marketing budget and delaying investments.\nIn addition, the company has said it will draw down an emergency \u00a375m overdraft for the first time, after agreeing the measure with the government. Channel 4 has about \u00a3120m in cash reserves.\nThe broadcaster is under more pressure than its rivals ITV, Sky and the BBC, as its \u00a31.1bn in annual revenues are derived almost entirely from advertising.\nWhile the nationwide lockdown has meant viewing is booming, and Channel 4 shows including Celebrity Bake Off and Gogglebox have set audience records, advertisers are delaying spending as the economy slumps.",

Schools across the UK were closed indefinitely from 20 March but remain open for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers.\nAt the lobby briefing, No 10 also played down the idea that schools could reopen, pointing to government advisers who said it was too early to talk about any lockdown measures being eased.\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told members he had received questions about the UCL review and responded in an email: \u201cThe government has not indicated to us that it plans to make any immediate changes to its policy based on the study.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThere will be many views within the medical and academic communities on the effectiveness of the government response to the crisis and sometimes these views will contradict and be in conflict with one another. What remains important at this time is that the public, parents and professionals continue to follow official government advice to keep safe.\u201d\nAn article in the Times on Wednesday quoted an unnamed senior minister as saying: \u201cWe need to be led by the science, of course. But if we can reopen schools after the Easter holidays things could begin to get back to normal.\u201d\nThe UCL survey claimed school closures had only a limited impact on the spread of previous infections. But it was criticised by some experts in infectious epidemiology as \u201ccherry picking\u201d and for relying on data from influenza outbreaks and brief school closures.\nNeil Ferguson, a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London and the author of influential research informing government policy, said school closures played an important role in severing contacts between households when combined with \u201cintense social distancing\u201d.\nJules White, the head of a state secondary school in West Sussex, said many school leaders were worried about how the UCL paper was interpreted, with many missing staff through illness or family commitments.\n\u201cSchools will do everything to support the national effort. But it\u2019s simply not sensible or safe to ask schools to open more fully unless coherent plans are in place to ensure that students, their families and staff will be safe,\u201d White said.\n\u201cA safe, wider phased return would be positive but only when the time is right and transparent plans are agreed by those who are charged to actually deliver them in our schools.\u201d\n This article was amended on 9 April 2020 because Neil Ferguson is a professor of mathematical biology, not of medical biology as an earlier version said.

Combining that week with the previous one, from 23 March to 5 April, the overall number of deaths registered was 27% above the five-year average.\nSpeaking at the Scottish government\u2019s daily media briefing, the interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said clinicians across the country were reporting to him that NHS Scotland was \u201ceerily quiet\u201d in terms of people presenting with concerns other than coronavirus.\nSmith said: \u201cPeople are perhaps making a choice not to present just now\u2026 but there are huge risks for people to hold on to symptoms like chest pains or bleeding.\u201d\nNicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said that she was \u201caware and concerned\u201d about the overall increase in deaths. \u201cSome of that is down to the deaths from Covid-19 that we are reporting today, some of it is down to the fact that in the previous week some registration offices were closed because they were adapting to this new system, so some of the deaths that were reported in that week were actually deaths from the previous week. But we don\u2019t think all of that increase is down to those two factors.\u201d\nAsked whether the significant increase in overall deaths suggested that people were not seeking medical care because of worries about infection or hospital capacity, Sturgeon said there was \u201cnot enough evidence to say that people are dying for those reasons\u201d.\nBut she added that the consistent Scottish government message that people should continue to use the NHS for other symptoms and conditions as they normally would \u201creflects the fact that we have a concern that people might be less likely to come forward because they know that the health service is under pressure\u201d.\nThe figures also reveal coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland have been 61% higher than first reported. The NRS data indicates as of 5 April there had been 354 deaths since the pandemic began. However, on that date only 220 were reported by Health Protection Scotland, a gap of 134 deaths.\nAs of 5 April, there have been 354 deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned in the death certificate. This compares with the figures from the Scottish government\u2019s daily updates, provided by Health Protection Scotland, which put the accumulated figure at 366 on Wednesday.\nThe NRS figures, which count all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, including as a \u201csuspected\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cause, offer a more detailed picture of the impact of the virus in Scotland.\nThey will be published weekly and complement the daily total from HPS, which counts deaths that have occurred within the last 24 hours of those who died with a positive test for the virus.\nWednesday\u2019s data shows that the vast majority of deaths were among people aged 65 years and older, with 306 of 354 in that age group.\nMen were more heavily represented in the figures, with 197 (55.6%) of the deaths male, and 157 (44.4%) female.\nGreater Glasgow and Clyde health board had recorded the highest number of Covid-19 deaths up to 5 April, with 122 deaths registered. To date, no Covid-19 related deaths have been registered in Orkney and Western Isles.\nComparable data for England and Wales from the Office for National Statistics shows a similar trend.\nThe latest figures indicate the number of Covid-19 related deaths registered was 70% higher than the official figure reported by the Department of Health and Social Care on 27 March.\nOn that date a total of 964 deaths were reported in England and Wales by the department; but the number of deaths that occurred to 27 March and were registered by 1 April was 1,639.",

I loved Satan\u2019s \u201caddress to the audience\u201d from a blank screen that precedes the movie, and Mills has a great sleepwalking scene that involves her rising from her bed in a full-length white nightgown and floating up to the ceiling, with some deep-throated demonic-ecstasy growling on the soundtrack.\nShe plays Jessica, a respectable wife and mother of two kids in San Francisco, married to a record producer, Robert, played by the Italian stage actor Gabriele Lavia (and dubbed). A previous lover of Jessica\u2019s called Dimitri (Richard Johnson) dies in a car crash but as his car is plunging over a cliff, Dimitri appears to cut a deal with the Evil One for 10 more years of life, in return for helping the devil with his plan to impregnate a lovely wholesome woman with his hateful spawn.\nAnd so Jessica becomes mysteriously pregnant with her unplanned third child, and Dimitri hangs around, to make sure Satan Jr is safely born. But might he be on the side of the angels after all? It is all the cue for some outrageously ripped-off head-swivelling and bile-spewing from the pregnant Jessica, and also some weirdly dodgy 70s sex moments, such as the possessed Jessica lingeringly kissing her small son on the lips.\nOne thing in this film gives us some valuable interpretative perspective. Jessica\u2019s daughter is horribly precocious, swearing, talking back to her parents and incessantly reading a paperback copy of Love Story. In many ways, The Exorcist and Rosemary\u2019s Baby were parables for the disillusioned peace-and-love generation and their fear and horror of the younger ones coming along.

In a daily media briefing, Rishi Sunak says the prime minister remained in an intensive care unit, where his condition was \u201cimproving\u201d.\nAccording to the latest figures, 1,858 people died in America on Tuesday, meaning it too suffered its worst death toll for a 24-hour period.\nThe new peak was propelled by New York City, which remains the most stricken part of the country, recording 806 fatalities. The city has now registered more than 4,000 deaths.\nDeaths in the country rise by 542 on Wednesday, 62 less than on Tuesday, according to official figures. The number of currently infected people increases by 1,195, or 1.3%. There was also a record day-to-day increase \u2013 2,099 \u2013 in the number of people who have survived the virus, taking the total to 26,491.\nEU member states are advised to extend their restrictions until 15 May, but the European commission is preparing a \u201croadmap\u201d to a coordinated lifting of lockdowns.\n\u201cWhile we can see encouraging first results, prolonging the travel restriction is necessary to continue reducing the risks of the disease spreading further. We should not yet let the door open whilst we are securing our house,\u201d said Margaritis Schinas, the commission\u2019s vice-president.\nThe suffering caused by he pandemic will be compounded by \u201cunavoidable declines in trade and output\u201d, the World Trade Organization said, as it warned that global trade could fall by up to a third this year.\nIt forecast a drop of between 13% and 32%, giving a wide range because the pandemic\u2019s economic impact is still so uncertain.\nThe European Union reshuffled its aid budget and promised \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.5bn) to help countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, as well as near neighbours in eastern Europe. The bloc\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cUnless the virus is defeated everywhere, it will not be defeated anywhere.\u201d\nWork is due to restart at some of the German car factories owned by the Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler in less than a fortnight. The firm said its German staff would work shorter hours until 30 April, affecting \u201cthe majority of production \u2026 as well as administration\u201d.\nThe Italian government said the pandemic had rendered its seaports unsafe for \u201cthe landing of people rescued from boats flying a foreign flag\u201d in a move that appeared designed to block rescue efforts for people struggling to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe measure \u2013 the first of its kind in Italian history \u2013 came as departures from Libya increased with the arrival of good weather.",

Right now they are not financially viable. Therefore, your delivery system is about to collapse.\u201d\nA survey of 175 GPs conducted by specialist health publication The Medical Republic found about half had lost more than 30% of their revenue. Roughly one-third reported losses of less than 30%.\nHart said those numbers accorded with the experience of the alliance\u2019s members, one of whom had reported a revenue loss as high as 75%, an issue the alliance says is compounded by new rules requiring GPs to bulk-bill 50-80% of their telehealth consultations.\nThe changes undermined the viability of GP-owned clinics, which traditionally had low liquidity.\n\u201cMost practices run with maybe two to four weeks of cash and we\u2019re three weeks into this,\u201d Hart said. \u201cSo we think that within six weeks we could see some of them closing their doors.\u201d\nRichard Nguyen, a general practitioner in Sydney\u2019s Sutherland shire, said he\u2019d seen patient numbers drop dramatically since lockdown laws came into place.\n\u201cBasically, when all of the isolation measures became more strict, my patient numbers dropped by more than 50%, and certainly in our GP groups people are seeing drops of up to 80%,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe flu shot has made that a little bit different in that people are coming in for that [but] I would imagine that once that dies down it will go back to being quiet. Obviously people are worried about going out so they are putting off the minor things they would usually come in for. But then all those routine things like skin cancer checks and mental health plans I think people are also putting off.\u201d\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is also hearing reports of \u201csignificant\u201d reductions in patient numbers, both those presenting to practices and those using phone services.\n\u201cThe general public should know that general practice is still very much open for business and patients should not neglect their health and wellbeing and usual medical care,\u201d the RACGP president, Dr Harry Nespolon, said.\nHunt appeared alongside the RACGP and the Australian Medical Association on Wednesday to urge all Australians to see their GPs and continue the normal management of their health.\n\u201cThat means \u2013 call the doctor. See the doctor if that\u2019s a face-to-face consultation that\u2019s required,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cBut don\u2019t ignore the doctor. For all of these health conditions, we want Australians to continue to focus on their ordinary health as well as the coronavirus management.\u201d\nHe said 2.5m telehealth consultations had already been conducted.\nThe federal government drastically overhauled telehealth arrangements late last month, expanding Medicare-subsidised telehealth services to create a system of \u201cuniversal telehealth\u201d, a move welcomed by the RACGP.\nIt also doubled the incentive for GPs to bulk-bill and introduced a new incentive payment to help GP clinics stay open as part of a $500m package.\nDr Maria Boulton, a Brisbane-based GP and AGPA director, said her clinic was now being forced to bulk-bill 80% of its patients due to the changes, something its business model is not set up to cope with.\nAt the same time, it has experienced a dramatic loss of patients. The practice was usually 110% booked out on any given day, but that was now at 70% and had dipped to 50% last week.\nTo break even, she and her business partner have stopped paying themselves an income, even with the government\u2019s various incentive payments factored in.\n\u201cFor us and for many, many practices like ours, it\u2019s going to hit us hardest, and I think it\u2019s going to be a shame to lose us,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\u201cWe\u2019re already stressed enough. We\u2019re putting our lives at risk, and this is not fair for us either.\u201d\nThe concerns about GP financial viability come as emergency doctors urge people to continue to seek treatment from primary healthcare practitioners where possible.\nThe Australian College for Emergency Medicine president, Dr John Bonning, said failing to seek treatment for mild to moderate health issues would later place a greater burden on hospitals \u201cat as time when it is unclear precisely when Covid-19 will peak\u201d.\n\u201cIn the ongoing response to the pandemic, it is important for people to know that our hospital emergency departments remain open to treat and care for severely unwell patients, and that staff are there to help,\u201d Bonning said. \u201cPrimary care is also still there for your routine and chronic healthcare needs.\u201d\nWhile the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency has begun mobilising thousands of retired doctors to help tackle the increasing load on the health system, Nguyen wonders why GPs aren\u2019t being asked to do more.\n\u201cI certainly think, not so much from a financial view but to make use of me and my skills, that it would make sense for GPs to be called on,\u201d he said.\nNguyen is now working one day a week at a Covid-19 clinic and says more GPs should be called on do that, if they are healthy and willing.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s better than using retired doctors and nurses who are the ones most vulnerable to this virus if they get sick.\u201d",

        "content": "City state reports 142 new infections as other countries eye ways out of lockdown amid economic fears\nFears have resurfaced about the ability of coronavirus to surge again after lockdowns are eased, as Singapore confirmed a sharp rise in new infections.\nOne of the worst-hit countries when the virus first spread from China in January, Singapore\u2019s strict surveillance and quarantine regime helped slow the outbreak, but recent rises in locally transmitted cases have raised fresh concerns. Singapore reported 142 new infections on Wednesday.\nForty of the new cases were linked to foreign worker dormitories. Tens of thousands of blue-collar foreign workers live in close quarters in the city state.\nCountries around the globe are grappling with the complex logistics of when and how to loosen lockdown restrictions to allow economies to recover while also avoiding a second major outbreak.\nDriving pressure to find an exit strategy is the catastrophic scale of damage to the global economy, with the World Trade Organization warning that growth is expected to plummet by up to a third in 2020 owing to the pandemic.\nThe European commission has advised EU member states to extend restrictions on non-essential travel until 15 May, but is preparing to issue a \u201croadmap\u201d on a coordinated the lifting of Europe\u2019s lockdown.\nAnnouncing the proposed extension of the travel ban, Margaritis Schinas, a commission vice-president, said: \u201cWhile we can see encouraging first results, prolonging the travel restriction is necessary to continue reducing the risks of the disease spreading further. We should not yet let the door open whilst we are securing our house.\u201d\nA Brussels plan for lifting the lockdown was revealed in a document leaked to the Guardian. Marked \u201cabsolutely confidential\u201d, the paper, which is expected be endorsed by the commission next week, says \u201cit is time to develop a well-coordinated EU exit strategy\u201d from the current measures. It says the easing should be done measure by measure on a month-by-month basis, while acknowledging that new infections could result.\n\u201cAny level of [gradual] relaxation of the confinement will unavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases,\u201d the paper says.\nEarlier on Wednesday, a Spanish government spokeswoman suggested that the county\u2019s tough quarantine measures could potentially start being reduced at the end of the month, before being corrected by colleagues who insisted the country remained in a \u201cdifficult phase\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Madrid\u2019s regional government said more than 4,200 people in care homes in and around the capital had died from coronavirus or while showing associated symptoms since 8 March. There are growing doubts over the way authorities in Spain are recording deaths, and fears that the country\u2019s true death toll may be far higher than has been recognised.\nThe US reported 1,858 deaths, a global daily record. Although there is no evidence that the country has yet reached a peak of infections, the vice-president, Mike Pence, said the public health agency was considering an announcement on easing restrictions.\nUnder the proposed guidance, people exposed to someone infected would be allowed back to work if they had no symptoms, tested their temperature twice a day and wore a face mask, according to a person familiar with the proposal under consideration.\nNew York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the state had recorded its biggest single-day death toll for a second consecutive day. There were 779 deaths on Tuesday, he said, putting the state\u2019s total death toll at 6,268. \u201cThe bad news isn\u2019t just bad, the bad news is terrible,\u201d Cuomo said.\nSwitzerland on Wednesday extended its anti-coronavirus restrictions for another week, to 26 April, but said a gradual loosening of the measures \u2013 which include border controls, school closures and bans on gatherings \u2013 would begin this month.\nIn other developments on Wednesday:\nSenior officials at the World Health Organization pushed back at calls by Donald Trump to withhold funding from the organisation, and calls by Trump\u2019s supporters for the resignation of its head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nTokyo recorded 144 infections, its biggest daily jump since the start of the pandemic, on the first day of a state of emergency aimed at containing Japan\u2019s outbreak.\nBritain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, the first major world leader confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, was said to be improving after spending a second night in intensive care.\nEthiopia, Africa\u2019s second most populous nation, and Liberia declared states of emergency to help curb the spread of the virus, a day after confirmed cases on the continent rose above 10,000.\nThe rise in cases in Singapore, previously hailed as one of a number of Asian countries whose lockdowns were successful in bringing their initial outbreaks under control, has underlined how easily the virus can return.\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan ended its 76-day lockdown on Wednesday morning, allowing residents to travel in and out of the city without special authorisation that had been given through a mandatory smartphone app. International health experts will be watching the situation in Wuhan for signs of new infections there, amid anxiety over Chinese transparency about its cases.\nAs different countries attempt to apply different lockdown measures, Turkey announced that it would monitor the mobile phones of citizens diagnosed with coronavirus to ensure that they do not break quarantine.\nThe presidency\u2019s communications directorate said those caught breaking the rules would be asked to return home and could be penalised, adding that Turkish law allowed for processing of personal data without consent for \u201cexceptional aims\u201d.",

        "content": "After 100 days of rapid change we now see we can do without celebrities but not shelf-stackers\n\u201cThere are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\u201d\nSo said Vladimir Ilyich Lenin of the ferment of revolution, but he could just as easily have been talking about the 100 days that have passed since the moment coronavirus officially became a global phenomenon, the day China reported the new contagion to the World Health Organization.\nThe world has been transformed in that time, perhaps nowhere more so than Britain.\nA hundred days ago, on 31 December, the UK prime minister delivered a video message full of hope and promise.\nThe coming year would, he said, be a \u201cfantastic\u201d one, the start of \u201can exhilarating decade of growth, prosperity and opportunity\u201d. In 2020, he enthused, Britain would brim with \u201cconfidence\u201d.\nThe early weeks suggested the PM might be right on one count at least. After three and a half years of rancour over Brexit, some of the poison began to drain out of the issue. Of course, it wasn\u2019t \u201cdone\u201d, as Johnson promised it would be, but it seemed as if we might dwell on lesser worries.\nWe saw in 2020 debating Megxit, a country with no greater angst on its mind than whether the Sussexes should carry on royalling.\nOn 31 January, the UK formally left the European Union. This new coronavirus was low down on the bulletins, safely tagged as foreign news.\nEven by early March, it had not quite bared its teeth. People knew the official advice but weren\u2019t sure quite how seriously they were meant to take it. Those politicians involved in public health messaging might attempt an awkward elbow bump at the start of a meeting, only to end it with a handshake or even a bear hug.\nJohnson himself, at a press conference on 3 March, cheerfully boasted that he was still shaking hands with people he met \u2013 including, he said, people infected with coronavirus.\nAnd yet, after a couple of those weeks in which decades happen, on 23 March Johnson was delivering a TV address to the nation, announcing a lockdown in what might have been a hackneyed scene from dystopian fiction. The pubs were closed, along with the football grounds and the cinemas and the theatres and the schools. Places that normally throb with noise were suddenly quiet and have remained so.\nYou can jog through Leicester Square, London, a place normally teeming with tourists, and hear nothing more than the flapping of a distant flag.\nTwo weeks on from that original edict and now the death toll is in the thousands with the prime minister himself in intensive care, a development that shook people who did not expect to be shaken. Decades, in weeks.\nThis is a story of change so rapid, we can barely absorb it.\nPeople focus on the questions that are human scale and therefore digestible \u2013 how long is the queue outside the supermarket? Do I need to wash vegetables if they\u2019re wrapped in plastic? Can I walk in a park if everyone else is walking in the same park? \u2013 perhaps because the larger questions are too big to take in, including the largest of all: is this plague going to kill someone I love? Will it kill me?\nThis is the greatest UK public health crisis in a century. It threatens a death toll in five figures. It dwarfs any such menace since the Spanish flu afflicted a nation already staggering from the losses of the first world war. Perhaps it will come to seem like an act of God that none of us could have done anything about, a plague on all our houses that could not be averted.\nOr maybe a future public inquiry will examine the fact that doctors and nurses were denied basic protective equipment, that care workers were forced to use bin liners for aprons and Marigolds for gloves, along with the paucity of ventilators and, above all, Britain\u2019s apparent inability to follow the WHO\u2019s instruction to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d, and conclude that the UK response to Covid-19 ranks as one of the severest failures of public administration in the country\u2019s long history.\nThat makes this a political crisis.\n\u201cThey were very slow. They didn\u2019t understand the scale of this,\u201d says one senior figure, who has witnessed the government\u2019s response close up. He says those at the top were \u201cblase\u201d, that emergency Cobra meetings were nothing like the efficient coordination exercises that have followed terror attacks, but \u201cchaotic\u201d, lacking \u201cdecisiveness\u201d.\nAs for the PM, \u201cI was surprised at how not in control Johnson appeared to be.\u201d There was a lack of comparative data on how other countries were responding, a lack of thinking strategically or several moves ahead. Put simply, he says, the government was \u201cwinging it\u201d.\nThe cabinet has looked callow in this period, lacking the seasoned faces of cabinets past. Dominic Raab, Rishi Sunak, Matt Hancock: they don\u2019t have that many years on the clock.\nEvery time a Michael Heseltine or Gordon Brown comes on the radio, social media brims with nostalgia for the heavyweights of yore.\nIt\u2019s one reason why the weekend just gone seemed to calm nerves. On Saturday, Labour elected a new leader who looked competent and capable. That brought one sigh of relief. Sunday brought another, as the country heard from its longest-serving public figure, its head of state.\nThe Queen\u2019s ability to reassure rests on her status as monarch, of course, but also on her extraordinary longevity at the centre of our national life. As she reminded viewers of her TV address that night \u2013 a vanishingly rare event in itself \u2013 she has been communicating with Britons at moments of distress for an astonishing 80 years.\nShe recalled broadcasting to child evacuees in 1940, thereby summoning up the mystic power of the event which serves as the foundation story of modern Britain \u2013 the moment when we stood alone against an evil menace, and prevailed. Her promise that \u201cwe will meet again\u201d, at once a glance back to the wartime past and a glimpse of a more hopeful future, will be remembered as one of the most significant \u2013 because necessary \u2013 acts of her 68-year reign.\nHad the weekend ended that way, a calm might have settled on the land. As one observer noticed, the Queen\u2019s message, along with Starmer\u2019s election, suggested the scaffolding of the British state was being hoisted back into place.\nBut the calm lasted less than an hour, the nerves jangling once more with the news that the PM had been taken to hospital \u2013 proof that even the most protected individual in the country, a Falstaffian figure of hale and hearty vigour, was not beyond the claw of this dreaded virus.\nEven so, despite the fear and the loneliness and the claustrophobia and the economic hardship of lockdown, few would say the country has sunk into despair.\nPrivately, our lives have been pared down to their barest essentials: no sport, no live entertainment, no nights out \u2013 just work, for those who still have it, family and remote contact with friends.\nThe work has changed \u2013 all laptops, pyjamas and Zoom for those who once toiled in offices \u2013 while family life has changed too, becoming much more concentrated and intense.\nFor some, that has been an unexpected joy; for others, it has been suffocating and even dangerous.\nBut our public life has also been stripped to its essentials. We\u2019ve come to see what\u2019s indispensable and what is not.\nIt turns out that we can function without celebrities or star athletes, but we really cannot function without nurses, doctors, care workers, delivery drivers, the stackers of supermarket shelves or, perhaps unexpectedly, good neighbours.\nIf you didn\u2019t value those people before \u2013 some of those belatedly recognised as key workers are among the lowest paid \u2013 you surely value them now. In a new tradition, we emerge from our homes and start clapping every Thursday night at 8pm to make sure they know.\nAlmost everything the prime minister predicted a hundred days ago has failed to come true: 2020 will not be a year of growth or prosperity, but the very opposite. And yet, on one thing he was right. Somehow, we have left the widest rift of recent years behind.\nLeave or remain now feels like an ancient divide, made suddenly irrelevant when the only distinction that matters is alive or dead.",

        "content": "Labour peer Andrew Adonis urges retailer to repay \u00a3585m government support package\nTesco has defended its decision to pay a \u00a3635m dividend while accepting a similar-sized tax break from the government\u2019s emergency coronavirus support package.\nThe Labour peer Andrew Adonis tweeted that it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d for Tesco to accept the business rates holiday worth \u00a3585m and said the retailer should \u201cpay it back\u201d if it could afford to pay a big dividend to shareholders.\nHowever, Tesco\u2019s chairman, John Allan, told the Guardian that rewarding shareholders was the \u201cright thing\u201d to do after they backed it through the five-year recovery from an accounting scandal.\nThe company\u2019s final dividend payment is worth \u00a3635m \u2013 making the total payout to shareholders about \u00a3900m in the year to 29 February \u2013 and came after a year in which it banked a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.3bn.\n\u201cI firmly believe that we have done the right thing,\u201d said Allan. \u201cThe right thing to do in these circumstances was to honour the pledge made to shareholders, particularly given that we have already made considerable efforts to look after our staff.\u201d\nTesco has 50,000 employees off sick on full pay, while hourly paid workers in its stores and distribution centres will receive a 10% bonus for time worked in April and May.\nTesco was not accepting any other government support, such as deferring VAT, and would not \u201cdip into\u201d any of the government loan schemes available, Allan said.\nIt also had not \u201ctaken a penny\u201d from the the taxpayer-backed wage support scheme despite having so many employees off sick, he said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for business rates relief, but it is being granted.\u201d\nIt flagged other expenses, such as the plastic shields installed at checkouts in thousands of its stores to protect staff, as well as large quantities of other safety gear, including gloves and hand sanitiser. Taken together, its UK running costs could increase by \u00a3650m to \u00a3925m, the group said.\nWithout the prospect of the tax break, Allan said it might not have been able to adopt the measures it had to safeguard employees and customers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done anything that has compromised our commitment to any of our other stakeholders \u2013 our employees and our customers \u2013 but also our shareholders who fund the business. We think they all deserve fair treatment,\u201d he said.\nThe pandemic has brought mixed blessings for food retailers. Tesco said sales jumped 30% in the first few weeks of the coronavirus outbreak as shoppers stockpiled before the lockdown. But it now faced extra running costs after it was forced to hire 45,000 new staff to keep its stores and distribution centres running.\nThe UK\u2019s biggest supermarket group said the full financial impact of the crisis on its finances this year was \u201cimpossible to predict\u201d, with the need to employ extra staff for the duration of the crisis increasing its wage bill by\u00a3415m to \u00a3580m, depending on the length of the government-imposed lockdown.\n\u201cThe 45,000 extra colleagues that we have recruited is transferring a huge amounts of money to the general public and off the public purse,\u201d Allan said.\nDave Lewis, the chief executive, said the retailer had to adapt quickly as the extraordinary increase in demand put pressure on stores and the whole food supply chain.\n\u201cUnderstandably, people were worried and we saw panic buying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw a sales uplift of around 30% as people began to stockpile, which then began to tail off as the UK moved into a lockdown.\u201d\nTesco said affluent shoppers had bought the most \u2013 10% of its customers accounted for almost a third of the extra sales, with stores in London experiencing the biggest sales increase.\nIn the busiest week, the retailer sold double the usual amount of baked beans and chopped tomatoes \u2013 6m tins and 3.3m respectively. Toilet roll sales were up 75%, while sales of liquid soap quadrupled.\nBritons made almost 80m extra grocery shopping trips in March, spending almost \u00a32bn more on food and drink than in 2019 and setting an industry record for monthly grocery sales. However, while sales of groceries rocketed, Tesco said demand in other parts of its business had collapsed, with clothing and fuel sales down by 70%.\nClive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco was facing huge extra costs associated with carrying out a \u201cpublic service\u201d. \u201cI think they have gone out of their way to ensure people have been fed. It could have hunkered down and run the business for shareholders,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Maurice Robinson makes plea after 39 Vietnamese migrants found dead in refrigerated truck\nA lorry driver from Northern Ireland has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese migrants who were found dead in a refrigerated trailer last year.\nMaurice Robinson, 25, was arrested shortly after the bodies of eight females and 31 males were found in a trailer attached to his Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, on 23 October. They included 10 teenagers, the youngest of whom were two boys aged 15.\nThe driver, from Craigavon in Northern Ireland, appeared at the Old Bailey via video link alongside four other men charged as part of an investigation by Essex police.\nHaving previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property, on Wednesday he also admitted 39 counts of manslaughter on or before 24 October last year.\nHe denied a further charge of transferring criminal property.\nProsecutors have asked for three weeks to decide on whether to proceed with a trial against Robinson on the outstanding charge, but other defendants face a trial at the Old Bailey lasting up to eight weeks from 5 October.\nThe people found dead inside the container, who were formally identified last November, are believed to have suffocated and overheated. Travelling in a lorry that had been nicknamed The Polar Express, Robinson had picked up the container after it had been brought to Purfleet in Essex from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. A short time later, ambulance and police made the grim discovery of the 39 bodies in the back at the estate in Grays.\nAmong four other co-defendants who appeared on Wednesday was a British Romanian man, Gheorghe Nica, 43, from Langdon Hills, Essex, who denied 39 counts of manslaughter.\nHe also denied one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019.\nA Romanian national, Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 27, from Tilbury, Essex, denied a charge of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.\nChristopher Kennedy, 23, from Darkley, Co Armagh, Northern Ireland, has previously denied conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.\nValentin Calota, 37, from Birmingham, was not asked to enter a plea to the charge of conspiring to assist unlawful immigration.\nThe prosecutor, William Emlyn Jones QC, said a human trafficking conspiracy charge was being dropped in relation to Kennedy and Robinson.\nThe hearing was conducted virtually with most lawyers and court reporters attending via Skype.\nAn Irish lorry driver wanted for his alleged role has meanwhile continued to fight his extradition from Dublin. Eamonn Harrison, who is wanted in Britain on charges of human trafficking and immigration offences, as well as 39 counts of manslaughter, had been granted permission by a judge in Dublin to appeal against his extradition.\nThe 23-year-old, from Mayobridge in County Down, Northern Ireland, is alleged to have driven a refrigerated container to the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium, and later signed the shipping notice for it.\nPatrick Corrigan, Amnesty International\u2019s Northern Ireland programme director, said: \u201cThis was a heartbreaking and horrific incident. Sadly, there will always be those willing to take advantage of people who feel forced to make dangerous journeys, because current immigration policies and practices deny them safe and legal options to reach the UK.\u201d",

        "content": "Doublespeak on Germany testing and a swipe at the EU show a chancellor learning from a master\nA week or so ago, Rishi Sunak appeared to be the cabinet outlier. The chancellor, who looked half the age of most of his colleagues, was the one most capable of delivering a press conference that connected with the country. Someone who can look people in the eye and accept responsibility for his actions. A rare quality in many politicians.\nNow, though, I\u2019ve begun to wonder if Sunak\u2019s impressive appearances at the daily Downing Street press conferences are less of a coincidence than they first appeared. Most of his older colleagues grew up on films and comics that still glorified or celebrated the second world war \u2013 beating the beastly Hun \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise perhaps that they are stuck in the mindset of the coronavirus as a battle to be won. An enemy to be beaten.\nThe chancellor comes with none of that baggage. He wasn\u2019t even alive when the first Star Wars film came out and was just two when ET was released. His childhood battles have been largely lived through light sabres and phasers. His cultural references belong to a different generation to those brought up on sticking it to Jerry. In short, he can speak 21st century human.\nIt\u2019s also fair to say Rishi has had to grow up fast. In his six months or so as chancellor, Sajid Javid didn\u2019t get to deliver a single budget. In just under two months, Sunak is now on to his fourth. The first was the Brexit budget, that was largely a work of complete fantasy designed purely to reassure many in the Conservative party that everything was going to be just fine once we left the EU. Then came the first coronavirus budget for those on PAYE. Then the second for the self-employed. Now we have a third for the charity sector. Don\u2019t rule out more in the coming weeks for those groups he comes to realise he\u2019s still forgotten about.\nNot that Sunak could pretend he was doing more than a modest bail-out. The charity sector has been hit by \u00a34bn losses and many staff lay offs, and all the chancellor had to offer was a relatively modest \u00a3750m package for those in the front line of fighting the coronavirus. But at least he was straightforward about what he was doing. No pretence that he could save every charity or every job. He even talked about the new spirit of people depending upon one another. Of kindness and decency. Words that would have had the near invisible Priti Patel and the all too visible Iain Duncan Smith choking on their early evening drinks.\nDespite insisting that it had moved at lightning pace from the start, the reality is the government spent the first two months doing next to nothing and has been playing a desperate game of catch up ever since. No amount of showing the same slide at every press briefing about how fewer people were using public transport was going to change that. Sunak\u2019s three coronavirus budgets have been sticking plasters at best. Very expensive ones.\nThe first misstep came when Sunak and the two health advisers tried to pretend that Prof Chris Whitty hadn\u2019t said that testing had been key to Germany\u2019s much lower mortality rate. He had. I and millions of others had heard him say just that. So trying to imply the Germans had cheated a bit by testing so many people and that the UK\u2019s death rate might be just as low if we had done as much testing just felt shabby. All of a sudden, straight-talking Rishi didn\u2019t appear quite so straight-talking. And he was also happy to let another minister break the news that the lockdown was not going to end any time soon. He was just there for the fun stuff.\nOr maybe not quite. Sunak\u2019s most terrifying utterance came almost as an afterthought. Asked whether, given that many economists have forecast that the coronavirus could hit GDP by more than 5% and send the UK into recession, it might not be a good moment to hit the pause button on the government\u2019s commitment to ending transition at the end of the year, Sunak went into swivel-eyed Europhobe. The EU were an untrustworthy bunch of bastards and getting shot of them \u2013 even if it cost a million more jobs \u2013 was a price more than worth paying.\nNothing would stop us leaving on December 31st. Not mass starvation. Not mass unemployment. Nothing. It was his commitment to the British people to make them as poor as was necessary. Maybe, Mr Nice Guy had been reading some of Boris\u2019s old War Picture Library comics after all.",

Activists say 20,000 illegal prospectors are currently laying waste to their preserve while Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has vowed to allow commercial mining in such areas.\nThe Amaz\u00f4nia Real website said Yanomami leaders suspected wildcat gold miners were responsible for bringing coronavirus into their 26,000-strong community.",

The cuts were \u201cvoluntary\u201d, a statement said \u2013 in contrast to those at Barcelona, Alav\u00e9s and Atl\u00e9tico, which used the government\u2019s ERTE scheme to unilaterally impose temporary reductions.\nAn agreement was announced on Wednesday evening, followingdiscussions with the players. The cuts will range between 10% and 20% for the year, with a statement saying the aim was to avoid more radical measures that \u201cwould affect other employees\u201d as well seeking to palliate the effects of the stoppage. La Liga played its last game on 8 March while Spain has been under a state of alarm for three weeks and will continue to be in lockdown until 26 April at the earliest.\nOn Tuesday the league president, Javier Tebas, outlined three working plans for return of domestic competition, all dependent on the health authorities. The earliest, most optimistic plan proposes the sport returning at the end of May. Tebas also said that in total Spanish football could stand to lose \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m) if the league season is not completed and \u20ac300m (\u00a3265m) in the event they complete the season behind closed doors.\nMadrid\u2019s announcement came the day after the Germany international Toni Kroos had suggested pay cuts were not the most effective measure. \u201cWaiving salary is like an empty donation or to the club,\u201d he told the German radio station SWR. \u201cIt should be something for everyone to consider [and] I think it\u2019s better to get the full salary and then do the right thing with it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary here; what I do with the money I get is a different issue. We must all help where help is needed, and there are many places where it is needed now.\n\u201cIt also depends how long everything is stopped.

But more recent entries are for entire planes, which suggests that it was the cabin crew who are infected.\nFor example, new data posted on the NSW Health website shows that a flight to Darwin from Sydney on 1 April and Darwin/Sydney flight operated on 2 April, a Sydney/Darwin flight on 3 April and a Darwin/Sydney flight on 4 April had a Covid-positive person on board. The notification is for all rows, which strongly suggests it was a cabin crew member who was infected.\nAnother flight between Sydney and Maroochydore and back again on 26 March has also been notified for all rows.\nThe Guardian has also learned that four crew members have tested positive following a flight from Dallas to Sydney, QF8, which landed on 27 March. The crew are understood to have socialised in Dallas.\nQantas has not confirmed the infections of the Dallas crew but the flight is now listed on the NSW Health site and all passengers are being notified.\nComment has been sought from Qantas.\nAnother cluster among crew who operated a rescue flight from Lima on 29 March has been confirmed by Qantas.\nQantas\u2019s chief medical officer, Ian Hosegood, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s exemption for air crew from mandatory self-isolation is critical to allow repatriations flights to happen and help stranded Australians get home safely.\n\u201cWe have introduced enhanced measures to further protect our crew while they are overseas. Pilots and cabin crew will be required to self-isolate in their hotel rooms and we are putting in place other measures in-flight,\u201d he said.\nQantas said the staff on the Lima flight were believed to have got it in Santiago.\nThe 14-day isolation rule applies to all international passengers. The government is now insisting that they be housed in hotels for their period of quarantine. But a number of states have also introduced quarantine rules for their residents returning from other states.\nYet cabin crew remain exempt, despite growing cases of them getting Covid-19 while overseas. As of last Friday, Qantas said that 50 of its employees had contracted coronavirus.\nThe TWU NSW branch secretary, Richard Olsen, said Qantas had failed to protect its workforce.\n\u201cWorkers at Sydney airport and at airports around the country are scared and they are not getting the support from Qantas.\n\u201cWith confirmation of yet another worker infected, people right across the airline will be worried about going home to their families and spreading the infection to them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe believe that Qantas is in breach of workplace health and safety laws and has not been putting in place systems to minimise the risk.\u201d\nThe union said one crew member had been sent an email on 6 April asking whether they recalled interacting with a passenger in a particular seat on a flight three weeks earlier \u2013 on 19 March, the day the Ruby Princess passengers disembarked.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Qantas said earlier in the week: \u201cThere\u2019s been no confirmed cases of transmission of the coronavirus to employees or customers on board our aircraft, or any aircraft globally for that matter. Whilst this transmission is possible, current evidence suggests it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\nQantas has said that as community transmission increases across the globe it will adapt its protocols on board and for operating crew to protect staff and customers.\nThe airline said it had introduced enhanced measures to further protect crew while they are overseas.\n\u201cIn most of these cases, the employees have contracted the coronavirus while overseas, including staff who were on holidays,\u201d Hosegood said last week.",

        "content": "Lack of equipment, dysfunctional government and conflicting messages are impeding country\u2019s efforts against virus\nDoctors in Pakistan have warned of \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions on the frontlines of the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, describing the pandemic as untreatable in one region and accusing police of brutally suppressing protests over working conditions.\nOne doctor who took part in a sit-in on Monday to protest against a lack of personal protective equipment said he had been \u201cbeaten and humiliated\u201d by police.\n\u201cIn the beginning, I thought, \u2018How could police use violence against the frontline fighters of Covid-19 when some days ago the same officers had saluted us for leading during the pandemic?\u2019\u201d said Amanullah, speaking from the police station where he was being held in Quetta, in the Balochistan region. \u201cBut we were wrong. Sticks and butts of AK-47 rifles rained down on us. We were dragged through the street and thrown into trucks.\u201d He and about 60 other doctors were held in police detention overnight and only released at midnight on Tuesday.\nIn the hospital where Amanullah works in the emergency ward, 16 doctors, including the head of the cardio department, have already been diagnosed with Covid-19. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that how many patients they spread the disease to,\u201d he added.\nMany of the patients who he and other emergency ward doctors had treated for non-coronavirus issues have since tested positive for the virus.\nHowever, doctors in the state-run hospital still have not been provided with PPE and in facilities that have not been designated as Covid-19 hospitals there are no isolation wards for doctors who have been infected.\nAcross the whole of Balochistan, which has become the focus of Pakistan\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, there are just 19 ventilators. The country has reported 4,000 cases of coronavirus, but testing rates are low and doctors believe the real figure is much higher.\n\u201cThere is a lot of psychological distress and trauma, as we have no idea how many patients we have infected or will be infecting,\u201d said Amanullah. \u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to march and demand PPE; not for ourselves, but to save the lives of many.\u201d\nYounas Elahi, a doctor working in a hospital in Quetta, said that for colleagues in the region who had not been given the necessary equipment, treating coronavirus patients was akin to suicide.\n\u201cDoctors are killing themselves in hospitals by treating patients without PPE,\u201d said Elahi. \u201cThey have no safe equipment. On the other hand, the government is unleashing violence against doctors.\u201d\nWithout proper safety equipment, doctors have had no choice but to refuse to treat coronavirus patients, he said, describing the situation as \u201cinsane\u201d. \u201cWe are so vulnerable and it makes me cry when I see patients begging for help when doctors can\u2019t even touch them. The health facilities here are deplorable \u2026 I think this pandemic is untreatable in Balochistan.\u201d\nIn one of the largest hospitals designated to deal with coronavirus, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, the capital, there are only 50 or so functioning ventilators. And two-thirds of Pakistan\u2019s population live in rural communities with no access to hospitals equipped to deal with coronavirus patients, or sometimes to any medical facilities at all.\nDr Zafar Mirza, special assistant on health to the prime minister, Imran Khan, said the issue was not an equipment shortage, but \u201cirrational use of PPEs\u201d. \u201cThe federal government has supplied at least three times the requested quantities, but due to irrational use and leakages they did not reach the right people,\u201d he said.\nSince 2010, healthcare in Pakistan has been devolved to provincial governments, where there has been rampant mismanagement and underfunding, leading to wildly varying standards across the country.\nThe dysfunction in Pakistan\u2019s coronavirus response also appears to go to the very top, played out in a public dispute between the federal government, provincial governments and the military over the decision whether or not to implement a full lockdown.\nOn 23 March, Khan declared that he would not implement a national lockdown because of the impact on Pakistan\u2019s poorest. But just hours later, Murad Ali Shah, chief minister of Sindh province, announced a full 15-day lockdown in his state \u201cto save the people of Sindh from this epidemic\u201d. The military, who wield enormous amounts of power and influence in Pakistan, then stepped in and undermined Khan by adding their support for a full lockdown.\nOn Tuesday, the military took the unusual step of providing emergency supplies of medical equipment to hospitals in Quetta, a job that would usually fall within the remit of provincial and central government.\nThe apparent inconsistencies were defended by Mirza, who said that \u201ccentral and provincial governments are almost on the same page. We are a federation and there can always be differences of approach.\u201d\nKhan has also been criticised for underplaying the impact of the virus, which doctors say is resulting in incidents such as last Friday\u2019s, when hundreds of thousands of people across Pakistan defied restrictions to attend prayers.\nA doctor in Islamabad described Khan\u2019s recent public remarks that coronavirus has a low mortality rate and was not dangerous to young or healthy people as \u201cillogical and unsafe\u201d.\n\u201cIt is to scary to keep repeating this mantra to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cImran Khan is not taking it seriously: that\u2019s why the public and his supporters are not taking it seriously too.\u201d",

No public polling has been released since the outbreak of Covid-19.\nAfter mounting pressure Ardern also announced that all arrivals into New Zealand would be forced into mandatory quarantine at 14 Auckland hotels for a minimum of 14 days.\nArdern said New Zealand\u2019s borders were its greatest asset in the fight against corona but also its weak point, with the majority of the country\u2019s 1200 cases still having links to overseas travel.\nThursday marked two weeks since the country entered strict lockdown measures, and the prime minister thanked New Zealanders for their efforts, and restated there would be no early end to the shutdown.\n\u201cIn the face of the greatest threat to human health we have seen in over a century, Kiwis have quietly and collectively implemented a nationwide wall of defence,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are breaking the chain of transmission. And you did it for each other.\u201d\nThe government will make a decision on whether to end or ease out of the lockdown on 20 April, two days before its scheduled end date.\nArdern was clear that whatever form the lockdown easing takes, Kiwis would only be moving from a level four to a level three, and many restrictions to freedom and movement would still apply.",

It only applies to sole traders, full- and part-time employees, and casuals who have been with the company for 12 months or more.\nIt\u2019s estimated this limitation will mean an estimated 1.1 million casuals alone will miss out on the payment.\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, just 47% of businesses in the arts and recreation sector reported they were still operating at the end of March but the extent of the short-term contract work in theatre, television, film, live shows and the wider arts industry means many of the 50,000 artists and 600,000 workers in the sector will potentially miss out on jobkeeper.\nThe second season of the Australian TV series Bloom, starring Bryan Brown, Phoebe Tonkin and Jacki Weaver will land on Stan this week. One of the show\u2019s camera operators, Marty Smith, won\u2019t have any income for the length of the pandemic and is ineligible for both the jobkeeper and the jobseeker payments.\nSmith, who has been working in the industry for 25 years on shows including Janet King, Preacher, Offspring and House Husbands, tells Guardian Australia all his work is generally in short-term contracts through production companies, meaning he hasn\u2019t been with any one employer for 12 months or more.\nThe majority of his work is not paid through his Australian business number, meaning he can\u2019t claim as a sole trader either.\n\u201cFundamentally, I\u2019ve lost 100% of my business and there\u2019s nobody there that is prepared to acknowledge that what I run is a small business,\u201d he says.\nSmith says he will still have expenses including insurance and the upkeep of his equipment in the time he has no work.\nHe has three children, with two doing in year 12 this year. He is not eligible for the jobseeker payment because his wife earns too much.\nThe actor Catherine V\u0103n-Davies had the last few weeks of her Sydney Theatre Company production come to an abrupt end, and then work worth tens of thousands of dollars out to November cancelled.\nJobseeker isn\u2019t a fit-for-purpose payment for the arts sector, she says, and there needs to be more funding broadly because the industry won\u2019t just pick up where it left off when the pandemic ends.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working on contract work it\u2019s not just like things resume once once work picks up again \u2013 you\u2019re starting from scratch,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI knew a few people who were getting their first big break on a major film productions but those those credits don\u2019t carry through.\u201d\nThe productions coming up were cancelled, not postponed, she says.\nAn actor and national performers committee member of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Jessica Tovey, tells Guardian Australia: \u201cI think there\u2019s an assumption that performers will be sole traders, and certainly there are probably a few people in our industry who do trade with their ABN, but the majority actually don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe sporadic work and varying employers mean the arts sector in particular \u201cdoesn\u2019t tick any of the boxes\u201d.\n\u201cIt sends a message that the work that we do and the contribution we make is lesser than other working Australians and that just doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d\nSmith says now more than ever, with people turning to TV to keep themselves entertained at home, Australians should realise that none of the people making these shows have work.\n\u201cThe biggest issue is, right now, turn on the television and any movie, or television show you\u2019re watching, there\u2019s not one cast or crew member that is working, across the world,\u201d he says.\nAustralia\u2019s arts minister, Paul Fletcher, has said his department had conducted preliminary modelling showing that \u201ctotal support to the sector could be in the billions depending on how many organisations are eligible and choose to take it up and how many eligible employees they have\u201d.\nGuardian Australia asked Fletcher\u2019s office for the modelling but his office did not provide it.\nOn Thursday the minister announced $27m in additional funding for regional and remote artists, Indigenous artists and Support Act \u2013 a fund and helpline set up to support musicians and other performing artists at this time. The Arts Council has also announced a $5m resilience fund for people who have lost work.\nIt is not just those in the arts sector who have infrequent work and multiple employers.\nFiona Cox, a comedian who does freelance advertising work between gigs, had her Sydney comedy festival show cancelled. Usually when there isn\u2019t comedy work, Cox says, she can normally seek casual advertising work, getting a job within a week.\nThat\u2019s not the case now: \u201cI\u2019ve reached out to everyone I know. I\u2019ve done a couple of jobs in the last month, and I\u2019ve only had about eight hours work, whereas I normally probably would have worked a whole month.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can see that I can claim jobkeeper simply because in the last 12 months I\u2019ve been paid by, I would say, about eight different employers.\u201d\nGuardian Australia has also heard from a number of employees of council-run services including pools and libraries which are not included in the scheme, because the federal government has argued it is the responsibility of the states to support local government services.\nAnd Matthew Pettit was working 25 hours between three jobs in Sydney \u2013 two in events retail and one in administration at a barristers chambers \u2013 in between his studies of information systems at the University of New South Wales. The job he has been with the longest was just a few weeks shy of 12 months.\nHe believes he is also ineligible for jobseeker because he is too young to apply for it, and can\u2019t get youth allowance because, despite living far from home, his parents earn too much and he hasn\u2019t worked enough hours to meet the requirements.\n\u201cIt seems as though I\u2019ve fallen through every single crack in every single system that has been put in place to assist people like me,\u201d he says.",

The focus is on those trying to make normal life out of an extraordinary situation.\u201d\nIt is a delicate balance in Spain, where the virus has killed more than 14,500 people and plunged its 47 million residents into one of the most restrictive lockdowns in Europe. For more than three weeks, social gatherings, leisurely walks and outdoor jogs have been banned in Spain, with residents ordered to remain in their homes except for essential trips.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying help people confront this situation with humour,\u201d said Longoria, who produced the 2018 film Everybody Knows starring Javier Bardem and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to try and normalise it in some way.\u201d\nAs a nod to the dark reality of the crisis, the producer\u2019s fee from the project was donated to purchase protective gear for healthcare workers. The first episode of the series aired on Tuesday on Spanish broadcaster RTVE.\nFeaturing 15 well-known Spanish actors, including Carlos Bardem, the brother of Javier, the series launched the cast and crew on to a steep learning curve as they sought to make primetime television from the confines of the lockdown. \u201cThe beginning was a bit rough,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cWe have 10 different houses where actors are shooting themselves and being directed via Skype.\u201d\nThe footage is then passed along a chain of editors, sound technicians and other post-production specialists. \u201cNobody has left their house. It\u2019s quite amazing but it works.\u201d\nIn recent days, Longoria has received messages from production companies around the world, many of them interested in adapting the idea to their local reality. As for Spain, where the lockdown is due to be extended to 26 April, those behind the series have little idea of whether the show will continue beyond its first run of eight episodes.\n\u201cThe best-case scenario would be that the series is very short,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cSo this immediately becomes a part of history.\u201d",

        "content": "Experts say household isolation may lead to increase in abusive behaviour and violence\nA helpline for perpetrators of domestic abuse who are seeking help to change their behaviour has received 25% more calls as the Covid-19 lockdown continues, fresh figures show.\nThe Respect phone line, which provides confidential advice to perpetrators about violence and domestic abuse, had a 26.86% increase in calls in the week starting 30 March, compared with the week before. The Respect phone line website recorded an increase in hits of 125% in the same period.\nThe Men\u2019s Advice Line, for male victims of domestic abuse, which is also run by the charity Respect, had an increase in calls of 16.6% in the same week, while the advice line website registered an increase in traffic of 42%.\nThe figures come as Refuge, the UK\u2019s largest domestic abuse charity, reported a 120% increase in calls to its helpline, which provides advice and facilitates referrals to refuge accommodation, in 24 hours following a fresh round of publicity on Monday.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the recently-appointed shadow home secretary, has called on the government to provide an emergency financial package to organisations providing domestic abuse support services during the Covid-19.\nExperts in the field have warned that abusers and their partners having to self-isolate together at home may lead to an increase in abusive behaviour and violence due to the pressure cooker effect of being trapped indoors.\nThe Respect phone line offers advice to individuals who have been violent towards their partners or are fearful conditions of the lockdown will lead to them losing control of their behaviour. There was an initial dip in calls at the start of the lockdown but an increase recorded last week.\nSara Kirkpatrick, a former services, research and development manager at Respect, said: \u201cAt the moment, what we\u2019re doing, the Respect phone line and our members, we\u2019re looking at de-escalation and self-management techniques. Those ideas about helping someone maintain non-harmful, non-abusive behaviours.\u201d\nKirkpatrick, who left Respect at the end of last week to take up the role of chief executive of Welsh Women\u2019s Aid, added: \u201cWe\u2019re opening up to respond to a broader range of issues.\n\u201cUsually, there are some things we would move someone on to a different source of support \u2013 issues relating to mental health and relationship issues that under normal circumstances aren\u2019t actually perpetrating domestic abuse and are just people feeling stress and anxiety.\n\u201cWe will be offering support to those people because actually in difficult times we don\u2019t want situations to escalate. A lot of the resources we have available will be about helping people to de-escalate difficult situations and manage themselves in a crisis.\n\u201cCallers are more concerned about being indoors more and worried about not being able to control their own behaviour, and feeling quite hopeless and helpless as there are more limitations on the other services they can get to, which increases anxiety even more.\u201d\nKirkpatrick said the charity\u2019s member organisations that work with perpetrators are having to move to non face-to-face work.\nSome domestic violence perpetrator programmes are based on a model similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Men who have been abusive in variety of ways, physical and emotional, get together under supervision, discuss their experiences and use a variety of interactive exercises to help them understand the impact of their behaviour.\nAt the start of lockdown procedures being announced, Refuge undertook a huge technological operation and moved its helpline, usually located in a cyber secure office environment, to an entirely remote system.\nOn Monday, the charity revealed calls to the helpline had increased 25% in the previous week.\nFollowing significant media coverage of the statistics, calls and contacts logged on the following day \u2013 6 April \u2013 were up by 120% compared with the previous day.\nSandra Horley, the chief executive of Refuge, said: \u201cThis is an enormous increase which underscores what we already know \u2013 domestic abuse is a scourge on society and must be addressed.\u201d\nThe freephone, 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Helpline is 0808 2000 247\nThe Respect phone line 0808 8024040 is open Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm",

        "content": "The new ventilators will be exempt from the usual safety and performance laws in a bid to get them into hospitals urgently\nTwo thousand new ventilators will be built in Australia by the end of July, a significant boost to the capacity of hospitals to respond to Covid-19.\nThe federal government has also enacted new powers allowing the health minister to exempt ventilators from the usual safety and performance laws of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in a bid to urgently get equipment into hospitals.\nFederal and state authorities have been working frantically to increase stocks of ventilators during the coronavirus crisis.\nThe federal government wants to triple intensive care unit capacity but modelling suggests there are currently not enough invasive ventilators \u2013 used to aid breathing in seriously ill Covid-19 patients \u2013 to support such a surge.\nOn Thursday the federal industry minister, Karen Andrews, and Victorian jobs minister, Martin Pakula, announced that 2,000 new invasive ventilators would be produced by a consortium of local companies, led by Grey Innovation, a Victorian business.\nThe Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, an industry-led not-for-profit, helped broker the deal, which, within a matter of weeks, has transformed Grey Innovation and its consortium into one of only two Australian manufacturers of ventilators.\nIts managing director, Jens Goennemann, said the project had been turned around with remarkable speed.\n\u201cHave you seen something like that in manufacturing? It\u2019s awesome,\u201d he told the Guardian.\nGoennemann said it showed the value of having an advanced and versatile manufacturing sector in Australia.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t respond if you are just an assembler,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to respond by being a manufacturer. The whole value chain: R&D, design, logistics, distribution, and service after. That is the versatility, the resilience, of a good manufacturing sector.\u201d\nThe extra ventilators will represent an almost doubling of Australia\u2019s ventilator stocks. Surveys of ICUs combined with hospital data suggest Australia currently has about 2,300 invasive ventilators. Hospitals have an ability to surge to 4,258 intensive care beds (191% increase), but that could only be matched by a surge of 2,631 invasive ventilators (120% increase), leaving a potential shortfall.\nThe federal government\u2019s $31.3m agreement with the Grey Innovation consortium is supported by a $500,000 grant from the Victorian government.\nProduction will begin in June and be completed by the end of July, using an existing design \u2013 owned by a separate medical device manufacturer and certified abroad \u2013 to get the ventilators into hospitals sooner.\n\u201cThis deal demonstrates the power of bringing Aussie manufacturers and clinicians together and is also a reflection of the highly advanced manufacturing capability that exists in our country,\u201d Andrews said in a statement.\nThe announcement comes just a day after new powers were enacted giving ministerial power to exempt ventilators from the usual safety and performance requirements of the Therapeutic Goods Act.\nSuch exemptions can only be made by the minister \u201cso that the devices can be made available urgently in Australia in order to deal with an actual threat to public health caused by an emergency\u201d.\nThe new powers were registered on Wednesday and will cease on 31 January 2021.\nVentilators are key in responding to Covid-19. Shortages in places such as Italy and the United States have had disastrous impacts and, in some cases, have forced doctors to decide which patients in swamped ICUs will get access to the life-saving equipment.",

        "content": "US officials voice hope that isolation measures are working amid accusations of racism in fight between Taiwan and WHO\nGlobal cases of Covid-19 are approaching 1.5 million, as both the US and the UK recorded their deadliest day yet in the pandemic, and a fresh World Health Organization row erupted.\nDespite the grim US death toll for Tuesday \u2013 1,858 in total, including 806 in New York City \u2013 White House taskforce officials said on Wednesday night there were signs isolation measures were working and the death toll may not be as high as the 100,000 to 240,000 minimum feared.\nDr Deborah Birx, the US virus response coordinator, said: \u201cWe carefully looked at Italy and Spain and we are doing much better in many cases than several other countries and we\u2019re trying to understand that. We believe that our healthcare delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary.\u201d\nMore than 88,538 people have died worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tracker. The number of confirmed infections is approaching 1.5 million, although it is believed to be far higher due to under-reporting by some countries.\nOfficial UK figures showed 938 more people had died in hospitals, bringing the total to 7,097, although the true death toll is likely to be significantly higher.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s White House briefing, Trump also responded to reports that US intelligence officials had warned his office as far back as November that a coronavirus was spreading through China\u2019s Hubei region. According to US media outlet ABC News, a report from the military\u2019s National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) said it could be \u201ca cataclysmic event\u201d and would threaten US forces in Asia.\nTrump said: \u201cWhen I learned about the gravity of [the outbreak] was some time just prior to closing the country to China. So I don\u2019t know exactly, but I\u2019d like to see the information.\u201d\nTrump imposed restrictions on travellers from China on 2 February, and did not declare an emergency until March.\nMeanwhile, an escalating feud between Taiwan and the World Health Organization (WHO) saw key figures publicly trading accusations in recent days.\nWHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that he had been subjected to months of attacks, including racist ones against him and black communities, and accused Taiwan of condoning the \u201ccampaign\u201d.\n\u201cThis attack came from Taiwan,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cTaiwan, the foreign minister, they know the campaign and they don\u2019t disassociate themselves.\n\u201cThey even started criticising me in the middle of all those insults and slurs.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry demanded a clarification and apology for what it said was a \u201cgroundless\u201d accusation and an \u201cextremely irresponsible act of slander\u201d. It said the government in no way condoned or encouraged personal attacks on Tedros.\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s 23 million population also experiences serious discrimination from the global health system,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cWe can relate [to Tedros] and we condemn any form of discrimination and injustice.\u201d\nThe feud largely stems from Taiwan\u2019s continued exclusion from WHO membership and activities due to lobbying by the Chinese government, which claims Taiwan as its territory.\nTaiwan has had extraordinary success in preventing a major outbreak, and the island\u2019s government has repeatedly complained that it is left out of the global response coordination. Last month a video went viral of a senior WHO advisor appeared to hang up on a Hong Kong journalist who asked about Taiwan\u2019s response efforts and WHO membership.\nThe WHO and Tedros have been criticised for being too deferential to China during the pandemic outbreak, which sought to suppress information in the early weeks.\nChina reported a slight increase in new coronavirus cases for the second straight day, as the number of infections involving incoming overseas travellers hit a two-week high. The National Health Commission reported 63 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier. Of those, 61 were overseas arrivals, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to 81,865.\nState-run CCTV reported land border entry points between China and Russia were temporarily closed after dozens of Chinese citizens crossed back into China in recent days carrying the virus. The northernmost province of Heilongjiang reported 87 imported cases, including 84 from Russia.\nThe city of Suifenhe, home to 70,000 people, reportedly introduced Wuhan-style lockdown measures from Wednesday, including restrictions on how many people can leave their house to buy necessities.\nIn other developments:\nBoris Johnson has spent a third night in intensive care, but on Wednesday he was sitting up in bed and \u201cengaging positively\u201d with the clinical team, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said.\nDoctors in Pakistan have warned of \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions on the frontlines of the outbreak, describing the pandemic as untreatable in one region and accusing police of brutally suppressing protests over working conditions.\nOxfam warned the coronavirus could push half a billion people into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out poor countries affected by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nConcerns about a potential outbreak in Yemen, where no cases have been reported so far, are partly behind a decision to call a halt to the military action there that has left tens of thousands dead and spread hunger and disease, a Saudi-led coalition spokesman, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said.\nItaly recorded 542 new deaths, but the rate has slowed slightly. The number of infected people increased by 1,195, or 1.3%. There was also a record day-to-day increase \u2013 2,099 \u2013 in the number of people who have survived.\nThe World Trade Organization forecast a fall in global trade of up to a third. The suffering caused by the pandemic will be compounded by \u201cunavoidable declines in trade and output\u201d, the WTO\u2019s director general said.",

There have been more than 432,000 cases in the US and 14,800 deaths in the country. In the UK there are more than 61,400 cases and more than 7,100 deaths.\nMitigation efforts are working, White House officials have said, leading to cautious optimism the pandemic will not claim between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives. One model run by the University of Washington School of Medicine predicts the virus will kill 60,000 people in the US over the next four months. Virus response coo-ordinator Dr Deboarh Birx said: \u201cWhat has been so remarkable to those of us who have been in the science field for so long is how important behavioural change is and how amazing Americans are in adapting.\u201d At the same briefing, Donald Trump said he would like more information on reports US intelligence officials had warned his office as far back as November that a coronavirus was spreading through China\u2019s Hubei region.\nMore than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out poor countries affected by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oxfam has warned.\nChina reported 63 new cases on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 81,865. While infections have fallen from their peak in February after China locked down several cities and imposed strict travel restrictions, authorities have called for continued vigilance amid fears of a second wave of infections.\nAustralia recorded just 96 new cases on Wednesday. This is the first time in three weeks the country has seen the number of new daily cases fall below 100 and the health minister said it was a hopeful sign that measures that had been introduced were helping to flatten the curve. Australia has just over 6,000 cases and 51 deaths.\nAmerica\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile is nearly out of the N95 respirators, surgical masks, face, shields, gowns and other medical supplies desperately needed to protect front-line medical workers treating coronavirus patients. This came after the US suffered its highest daily death toll from coronavirus on Tuesday, with 1,858 people succumbing to the disease.\nThe UK prime minister remains in intensive care receiving treatment for Covid-19, but on Wednesday, the chancellor Rishi Sunak reported Johnson was sitting up in bed and \u201cengaging positively\u201d with the clinical team.\nConcerns about a potential outbreak in Yemen, where no cases have been reported so far, are partly behind a decision to call a halt to the military action there that has left tens of thousands died and spread hunger and disease, a Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki has said.",

Normally there\u2019s a peak in calls after school, but everyone is at home so there are loads of young people coming through all the time. There is also a lot more risk than we\u2019re used to \u2013 it\u2019s not just friendship issues, it\u2019s problems with much more complexity.\nKids are stuck at home with families where there\u2019s already problems. Some used to go for walks to get away from it and now they can\u2019t, or kids have had their counselling sessions cancelled or moved to phone calls. For those with really severe problems, like suicidal thoughts, hospitals are less safe because of coronavirus, so some parents are having to watch them 24 hours a day.\nWe\u2019ve had to close the service between midnight and 9am because of the lack of [staff] resources. Our management team have been great, they really want to keep the service going, but there are so many volunteers who can\u2019t come in because they\u2019re ill or high risk. I\u2019m part time, but I\u2019ve already done overtime, nights and weekends. I\u2019m doing three late shifts a week at the moment to cover shifts, when normally I do maximum one or two.\nWe get assaulted a lot, but there\u2019s a new wave of people threatening to cough on us or saying they\u2019ve got Covid-19 and using it as a way to threaten the officers.\nThe vast majority of people are following the guidance, but for some, having police officers tell them they can\u2019t do something makes them challenge it, because it\u2019s so different to how things normally are. We\u2019re stuck in the middle, because we haven\u2019t put these restrictions in place, we just have to enforce them.\nThere are quite a lot of staff in self-isolation, and all non-essential training has been cancelled, but at the moment staffing is relatively normal.\nIf we\u2019re going to an address where we know there\u2019s symptoms, or someone is self-isolating, then we wear personal protective equipment, but we have a shortage like everywhere else. In custody, we don\u2019t have the facilities to space people out any more than we would normally do. If they present symptoms, we can wear face masks whilst interviewing them, though.\nIn a way, I\u2019m quite glad I\u2019m still working, because I think I\u2019d be going stir crazy in the house. Normally, when we work on the weekend, a lot of our involvement is in people going out drinking, but if you drive through the city centre now, it\u2019s empty. It\u2019s like a parallel universe.\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of hours because of the reduction to the service, so my income has dropped significantly. Despite this, I\u2019m still expected to go out and drive buses with people coughing and sneezing.\nWhen I pick up my bus, I do all our usual checks, and then I sit in the driver\u2019s seat and go over every single part that I might touch with my antiviral wipes, then gel by hands, and then I can set off.\nFor many of my elderly passengers, taking the bus to go shopping is the only way they can get out. There\u2019s one old boy who says that the moment he sits in a chair at home, he won\u2019t get back out. Most of them aren\u2019t online either, so they can\u2019t order anything for delivery. I\u2019m worried about giving something to them.\nThe authorities don\u2019t want to run empty buses because it won\u2019t be profitable, so they have to limit the number. But that means people are waiting for ages and all pile on, which reduces the space they have. There\u2019s no social distancing there, but I can\u2019t go round and clean the bus every time I stop. It\u2019s quite frightening, really.\nMy partner has a heart condition, and I don\u2019t want to think about the possibility of giving it to him. I don\u2019t want to be the reason my husband dies. It\u2019s a horrible situation, but my husband can\u2019t work, so I\u2019m the only breadwinner. If I don\u2019t earn money, we don\u2019t have any.\nAt the moment, we\u2019re lucky enough that no one has symptoms. It\u2019s a strange atmosphere but it\u2019s still quite positive. There aren\u2019t many residents who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on; even those with dementia understand that things are different because of a global phenomenon. They\u2019re all going along with it really well, and if they start to feel lonely, we set up a private video chat with their family.\nWe\u2019re placing a lot of trust in the staff, like when they get home they\u2019re staying indoors, but they\u2019re worried too, and very dedicated. They take their temperatures in the morning when they arrive, sanitise their hands, and bring a change of clothes to work in.\nWe\u2019ve set up WhatsApp and Facebook groups to keep in touch with families while they can\u2019t visit. We take photos and videos throughout the day so they can see that our residents are still doing things.\nThis is something no one could ever have imagined, but we have dealt with diarrhoea and vomiting outbreaks and had to isolate residents. The biggest difference is the uncertainty. The government don\u2019t seem to have a clue, so we\u2019re just doing what we believe is the best way to do things.\nGetting food has been difficult for staff. We had a member of staff turned away from Tesco at the healthcare workers\u2019 hour \u2013 they were told they weren\u2019t a real nurse because they didn\u2019t work for the NHS. I made ID badges and laminated them for the staff, but again they said we couldn\u2019t go at the NHS time. Even when you can get in, the shelves are empty.\nI\u2019m still delivering junk mail and that seems mad at the moment when post office workers are going off sick \u2013 one piece of junk mail for pizza showed a picture of people in a park together. Online shopping has led to a huge swell in the number of packets we\u2019re delivering. It\u2019s like Christmas.\nSocial distancing means new rules \u2013 no more than one person to a post van. The other postie, who would normally be doing the walker\u2019s side of our route, is now expected to walk out to the drop-off point or catch a bus. The two-metre rule is almost impossible to enforce when we\u2019re working in the office, and people are very worried about that.\nOne of the extra key services I\u2019m providing is conversation. There\u2019s one older woman who lives by herself and wishes it could all be over for her birthday in a week\u2019s time. She\u2019s asked to me to swear I won\u2019t stop delivering to her, whether I get the virus or not.\nThe first huge panic took us by surprise \u2013 we had no restrictions in place. A lot of our customers are regular people who we\u2019ve known for years, but there were lots of new people who didn\u2019t know how things worked or where they were. They wouldn\u2019t use self-checkouts because of the germs, so there were long queues. There was a lot of anger directed towards us, and it was panic-stricken.\nWe\u2019re only letting in about 40 people at a time, and there are queues outside in the early mornings. The car parks are normally full with about 150 cars, but there are about 15 there now. During the initial lockdown, the car park was deserted, and a large rabbit came up to the staff door everyday. We never normally see wildlife, but it was so quiet that the rabbits were coming out to play.\nWhat\u2019s most strange is that people just don\u2019t talk in the store \u2013 they nod and smile and whisper.\nIt\u2019s worse than it is at Christmas. I would normally do about 10 or 12 drops each day, 14 at a push, but yesterday I did 20. I\u2019m still dropping off orders of \u00a3400. Sometimes people shop for multiple families because they can\u2019t get delivery slots.\nNowadays, we have no complaints about replacing items with alternatives, people understand, and that\u2019s very different to usual. Our policy was to carry shopping in if needed, but now we aren\u2019t allowed in anyone\u2019s house, we just leave them at the door in bags and step back. We won\u2019t collect the bags either, which has caused a massive explosion in plastic.\nIt\u2019s a very stressful time, and I\u2019m definitely concerned about bringing [the virus] back. We don\u2019t get gloves or face masks, just gel. None of the people packing the vans wear gloves, and we share vans which run from 6am to 11pm, so you don\u2019t know who\u2019s touched what.\nI was working on the night of the national NHS clap, and people came to their gates while I was driving down the road and cheered, saying, \u201cWell done, driver,\u201d and things like that. That was great.\nThis week has been really draining for me. I have been present at eight funerals and five of them were coronavirus-related. I\u2019ve been a gravedigger for five years, I work in one of the smaller London cemeteries; there\u2019s a nice community vibe here. Doing what I do, I\u2019ve been really aware of the seriousness of the outbreak, but I think it took the public longer to become aware of it.\nEven after the lockdown was announced, people were still playing football and frisbee in the cemetery. At one burial there were about 30 people standing closely together and they all hugged each other afterwards. I was thinking I could end up burying some of them.\nI do worry about what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s incredibly stressful. Workers here are concerned about catching something because the virus lives on surfaces. It can be on a coffin, or anywhere, you just don\u2019t know. We do have enough PPE at the moment, but it won\u2019t be easy for a family to see us in hazmat suits during a funeral.\nDeath is such a taboo subject, but we have to be more open as a society about talking about it, particularly now. We just don\u2019t know where we\u2019re heading. The atmosphere is very tense.\nCoronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

The refugees can\u2019t use the mitigation methods the rest of society are practising, like social distancing. Without these, the spread of the disease could be exponential and we estimate that half the population could be infected within four weeks.\u201d\nLast week, local authorities in Calais and Dunkirk began to move people from the informal camps into accommodation centres, but volunteer groups say the pace is too slow, with approximately 80 people transported by bus from the camps to the centres last week. NGOs say they believe the accommodation centres currently only have capacity for 400 people in total while there are thought to be about 1,500 people sleeping rough in informal camps in northern France.\nGrassroots aid groups also say that food supplies are running out and the French authorities have limited the supply of water to informal settlements.\nAccording to the aid groups, people are relying on daily food packs supplied by the government, which consist of a piece of bread and cheese. Under the strict quarantine measures in place, without proper paperwork migrants cannot enter the supermarkets to buy food for themselves.\nBefore the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in the camps last week, conditions were already deteriorating. Aid organisations have reported overcrowded tents, rat infestations and worsening health conditions among children and adults sleeping outside.\n\u201cRefugees living in northern France already have weakened immunity from chronic stress and the deplorable conditions they are forced to live in,\u201d said Sarah Story, co-founder and director of Refugee Info Bus. \u201cAll homeless refugees in northern France must be provided with safe, obligatory accommodation and food, not just for their safety, but for us all.\u201d",

        "content": "Ministers voice concern Easter weekend could see change in public behaviour\nDominic Raab is expected to signal that stringent lockdown measures must remain in place beyond next week, in the first key government decision to be taken while the prime minister remains in intensive care.\nThe death toll from coronavirus is continuing to rise daily, with 938 UK fatalities announced on Wednesday \u2013 close to the highest daily figures reported in Italy and Spain. Medical experts are not expecting the peak to come for more than week.\nWith the long Easter weekend looming, ministers are concerned that any suggestion of an imminent loosening of restrictions could result in an immediate change in the public\u2019s behaviour.\nThe Guardian has learned that at least five police chief constables want the government to consider toughening coronavirus lockdown restrictions amid concerns that a growing minority will flout the rules over the bank holiday. Options for more stringent curbs include preventing people driving long distances and legislation to enforce the government\u2019s order to limit exercise to once a day.\nGovernment sources suggested Raab, the foreign secretary deputising for Boris Johnson \u201cwhere necessary\u201d, would address the issue at Thursday\u2019s Downing Street press conference \u2013 and prepare the public for an extension of the measures put in place on 23 March.\nLegislation to implement the measures dictates that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, must also oversee a formal review of their impact by next Thursday \u2013 and another within three weeks after that.\nJohnson, 55, was set to spend a third night in intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London on Wednesday night. While his condition was said to be improving \u2013 with Johnson able to sit up and talk to medics \u2013 Raab is now chairing the powerful four-man Covid-19 committee, which has continued to drive the government\u2019s response to the crisis while the prime minister is in hospital.\nThe group, effectively an inner cabinet that meets daily, also includes the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, Hancock and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.\nOn Tuesday, Raab declined to say whether a review of the restrictions would take place as planned next week, in the absence of Johnson. But the foreign secretary is expected to address the issue directly on Thursday, after a Cobra meeting in the morning \u2013 the first since the measures were imposed.\nCurrent restrictions oblige the public to remain at home unless they are exercising, shopping for essentials or going to a job that cannot be carried out at home.\nPressure for clarity from the government intensified on Wednesday, as senior politicians from across the UK suggested the lockdown must remain in force.\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: \u201cI think when the prime minister announced the lockdown just over two and half weeks ago, he said he would review it in three weeks\u2019 time, which is this Monday. I think we\u2019re nowhere near lifting the lockdown.\n\u201cIn London we lost 224 lives [on Tuesday], so we\u2019re still, I\u2019m afraid, on a daily basis seeing too many people losing their lives. At the moment thankfully we\u2019ve got some spare capacity in intensive care units in London but we can\u2019t be complacent at all.\u201d\nIn Northern Ireland, the communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, suggested the lockdown should remain in place \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d.\nMark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told an online meeting of the Welsh assembly: \u201cWe will not throw away the gains we have made, and the lives we can save, by abandoning our efforts just as they begin to bear fruit.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThere is more work to do in reviewing the regulations. The precise nature of what will follow the current regime will be agreed over the coming days.\u201d\nNicola Sturgeon also said that Scotland is not expecting to see an end to the lockdown any time soon. It is understood that evidence to the Scottish government does not support the idea that the peak of cases or deaths is imminent north of the border, and the expectation in Holyrood is that rigorous physical distancing is likely to have to go on for 12-13 weeks.\nSunak made clear at Wednesday\u2019s press conference that the evidence is not yet available to enable politicians to lift the lockdown \u2013 and suggested formal confirmation of any extension may not come until next week. He said the Cobra meeting on Thursday would \u201ctalk about the approach to the review\u201d.\n\u201cWe committed that there would be a review in and around three weeks; that review will be based on the evidence and the data provided by Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies], which will only be available next week,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority right now is to stop the spread of this virus: to get the other side of the peak,\u201d he added.\nThat message was underlined by the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Angela McLean, who said the government would need evidence about whether the entire \u201csuite\u201d of lockdown measures is working, before any decision to lift them could be made.",

        "content": "The Australian Rugby League Commission has confirmed the NRL intends to get back on the playing field on 28 May but there is still no clarity on what the competition will look like once the 2020 season restarts.\nMeetings of the league\u2019s innovation committee and the ARLC were held on Thursday before the ARL commissioner, Wayne Pearce, confirmed the intention to get the league back under way in seven weeks\u2019 time.\nThe announcement came just hours after Channel Nine aimed a scathing broadside at the league, accusing it of \u201cmismanagement\u201d and squandering millions of dollars over a number of years.\nInitially, a 15-round regular season, 10 less than originally scheduled prior to the coronavirus-enforced shutdown, was being considered.\nHowever, hours after Nine\u2019s criticism, it emerged the league is looking at completing all 25 rounds, which would result in a November grand final.\n\u201cThe details on the competition structure we haven\u2019t got yet because the landscape is changing around government boundaries. That will feed into the complexity structure,\u201d said Pearce, who also heads up Project Apollo, the panel charged with finding a way of getting the season back up and running.\n\u201cToday what we landed on was a starting date. We haven\u2019t finalised what that [competition] looks like yet. Why we want to firm up a date is to give certainty to players and their schedules, clubs and thousands of people who are out of work through clubs and millions of fans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mark for everyone to work towards that\u2019s associated with the game.\u201d\nPearce suggested the proposal to split the league into conferences was off the table.\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaning towards a competition structure that looks more aligned with what we\u2019ve currently got. We\u2019re not going to the conference scenario at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve currently got support from the New South Wales government in terms of if we adhere to public health guidelines and make sure our players follow those guidelines we are able to train and play provided we have strict measures around testing the players and put other protocols in place to minimise the risk of infection within the playing group and community.\u201d\nEarlier, in a strongly worded statement, broadcasting rights co-holder Channel Nine criticised the NRL\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which forced the 2020 season to be put on hold after just two rounds and plunged the game into financial crisis.\nPearce said the NRL was still planning to work with Nine for the rest of the season and honour the $1.8bn deal signed with the broadcaster and Foxtel in 2015.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a key partner for us and we intend to fulfil our contractual obligations. We hope to maintain a working relationship that will work for both parties,\u201d he said.\nARLC chairman Peter V\u2019landys apologised to the network, who were understood to be furious with being left out of talks focused on restarting the season.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s been miscommunication and Channel Nine feel they haven\u2019t been part of the process, absolutely [I apologise],\u201d V\u2019landys told The Nine Network. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the cost structure that\u2019s in place for the game at the moment is unsustainable, so that [criticism] is accurate.\u201d\nA November finish for the NRL would mean a clash with the men\u2019s T20 World Cup, whose broadcast rights are also owned by the Nine Network. Up to four cricket matches would coincide with possible NRL finals fixtures.\nIn an explosive statement released on Thursday morning, Nine accused the NRL of financial mismanagement and claimed they had broken their broadcast deal.\n\u201cAt Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by Covid-19,\u201d the statement read. \u201cBut this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years.\u201d\nThe NRL is in the third of a five-year broadcast deal, most of which is with Nine and Fox Sports, worth a reported $1.8bn. The deal with pay television broadcaster Fox Sports is believed to be worth $1bn, while free-to-air broadcaster, Nine, is worth an estimated $625m.\nHowever just last week, Nine announced it would save $130m if the remainder of the NRL season was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nFree-to-air networks are also believed to be suffering from a 20% reduction in advertising revenue during the pandemic.\n\u201cNine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on to support the clubs, the players and supporters,\u201d the statement continued.\n\u201cIn the past the NRL have had problems and we\u2019ve bailed them out many times, including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed.\n\u201cIt would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters.\n\u201cWe now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk through a long-term plan.\u201d",

        "content": "Dan Tehan says the schools must resume face-to-face teaching for children whose parents want it or he will remove funding\nThe federal education minister, Dan Tehan, has ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two.\nIn a letter, sent to the Independent Schools Council of Australia and peak bodies in each state and territory on Thursday, Tehan stated he will use Australian Education Act powers to impose a new condition on independent schools, in effect requiring them to make classroom learning available or risk losing federal funding.\nIndependent Schools Victoria chief executive, Michelle Green, said the demand put its schools in an \u201cimpossible situation \u2026 caught between conflicting advice from state and federal authorities\u201d.\nIt comes as the national cabinet meets on Thursday, a further opportunity for the Morrison government to push for schools to be reopened as early as term two, which begins on Tuesday in some states.\nFederal, state and territory leaders discussed how to develop a consistent national approach to which students should attend schools after the Easter holidays although no decisions were made.\nTehan\u2019s order represents a shift away from online learning at home to classroom attendance, a move likely to spark tension with Victoria, which favoured early closure of schools to contain Covid-19.\nDespite rising community concern the Morrison government opposed school closures all through March on the basis of medical advice, and even used the threat of withdrawing funding from independent and Catholic schools in a bid to force them to remain open.\nClosures were eventually triggered by Victoria\u2019s decision to bring forward school holidays, and the use of pupil-free days in other states to prepare for online learning. In-person attendance at New South Wales state schools dwindled to as low as 5%.\nIn the letter, seen by Guardian Australia, Tehan said he was aware \u201ca small number of independent schools have chosen to stand down all physical classroom delivery and move to alternative, or online classroom delivery\u201d.\n\u201cWhile I appreciate that a number of jurisdictions are moving towards this form of service delivery, I am asking schools to retain a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who may not have a choice of keeping children at home,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese might be the children of essential front line workers such as paramedics, nurses, doctors and police officers who, in the absence of a classroom option, are forced to make the decision to stop working in our essential services.\u201d\nTehan added that students should \u201cnot be refused physical classroom access based on their parent\u2019s employment\u201d.\nTehan noted his power in the act to impose conditions on schools\u2019 funding whether he believes them to be in the public interest.\n\u201cTherefore I am advising you that I will be varying the approval of all independent approved authorities to include a condition from the commencement of term two, requiring schools to provide a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who choose to access it,\u201d he said.\nDespite the order, Tehan also recognised the need for schools to follow \u201cthe advice of the health or education authorities of the commonwealth or the state or territory in which the school is located, including any directions they may issue in regard to school shut downs\u201d.\nThe condition provides an exception for schools following local health or education authorities\u2019 direction if the authority \u201chas acted genuinely and in good faith in discharge of its duties of care to students, employees and others\u201d.\nGreen noted the Victorian chief health officer had advised all schools to move to remote learning, and that \u201call children who can learn at home must learn from home \u2013 with exceptions only in extremely limited circumstances\u201d.\nGreen said Tehan\u2019s warning about funding \u201cleft teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students, confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress\u201d.\n\u201cI have alerted the federal minister to the practical implications of his announcement and pressed him for urgent clarification.\u201d\nOn Thursday the Northern Territory government announced that school attendance will be compulsory from day one of term two, 20 April.\nThe New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said her government was in talks with education experts about how to educate children and would use the Easter break to \u201cconsider our options about what term two for schools will look like\u201d.\n\u201cBut again it will be based on health advice and in consultation with all of our stakeholders, including of course principals and teachers and parent groups as well,\u201d she said.\nState by state guide:\nTerm two dates: 14 April\u201326 June\nThe first day of term two is a student-free day. Students are still expected to start from Wednesday 15 April.\nPosition on schools: Most students will be educated from home when term two starts to ensure physical distancing helps slow the spread of coronavirus. Free internet access and laptop will be provided for students who need them.\nOnsite learning will only be available for children whose parents can\u2019t work from home and vulnerable students without access to a suitable learning environment.\nTerm two dates: 27 April\u20133 July\nPosition on schools: State schools have remained open but in-person attendance fell to 5% in the first week of April. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said to expect a further announcement about term two after the Easter break.\nTerm two dates: 20 April\u201326 June\nPosition on schools: Schools remained open for children of essential service workers, with pupil-free todays used to plan for online education. Announcement on term two expected on Tuesday.\nTerm two dates: 28 April\u20133 July\nPosition on schools: Teachers are preparing to continue delivering learning from home for their students, but parents are advised that \u201cif you have to send your children to school, we will continue to provide a safe environment for them and support their learning\u201d.\nTerm 2 dates: 28 April\u20133 July\nPosition on schools: ACT public schools will move to remote learning in term two. Most public school students will undertake their learning from home.\nFor parents and carers who cannot keep their children at home, due to work or additional needs, the ACT government will provide supervision at a reduced number of public school sites.\nTerm two dates: 27 April\u20133 July\nPosition on schools: In South Australia, the advice of the chief public health officer is that schools, preschools and early childhood services should remain open. Parents can choose to keep their children at home.\nTerm 2 dates: 28 April\u20133 July\nPosition on schools: From 26 March, families were encouraged to keep children at home, if they could access the online or other resources for their education to continue.\nTerm two dates: Begins 20 April.\nPosition on schools: Unless a school contacts parents directly with alternative arrangements, children are to physically attend school. Exceptions can be made for parents who have informed the school their child will be learning from home.",

        "content": "Striking a perfect balance between friction and flow, could this battle royale hit be the perfect shooter game?\nThat\u2019s it. I have now played Apex Legends for over 500 hours. The online multiplayer shooter, developed by Californian studio Respawn Entertainment and released in February 2019, has been my obsession all year, seeing off a variety of pretenders from Doom Eternal to Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\nTo the casual observer, there\u2019s nothing remarkable about it. Set in a science-fiction universe tied to Respawn\u2019s successful Titanfall series, it is another title in the battle royale genre alongside the Goliath that is Fortnite, as well as PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds and Call of Duty: Warzone. You land in a hi-tech future landscape with two team-mates and then you scramble about, finding weapons, while 19 other teams try to kill you and everyone else. The last team left alive is the winner.\nBut the thing is, Respawn is one of the greatest designers of fast-paced shooter games in the industry. Formed in 2010 by the creative directors behind Call of Duty, Jason West and Vince Zampella, the studio was set up with most of the technical and design staff behind the legendary Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare \u2013 and this experience shows in Apex Legends.\nOne vital element of game design that\u2019s explored perfectly is the interplay between flow and friction. Indeed, much of the time Apex Legends feels frictionless. When you move through the environment you do so freely; if you like, you can hit a button to slide, giving you a short speed boost on level ground but also allowing you to sledge extremely quickly down hills. It\u2019s quick, satisfying, and if you\u2019re sliding toward an object, you can hit the jump button to break out of the animation, gracefully avoiding a collision. The two Apex Legends maps we\u2019ve seen so far are designed to encourage and facilitate this form of traversal, with lots of slopes and valleys to explore.\nBuildings and rockfaces also keep the player moving. Whenever you approach a tall object, there is almost always a handy grip point \u2013 say, a rocky outcrop or a window ledge \u2013 a few metres higher than your character. When you jump at a vertical surface, you scramble up a little, adding extra height and putting that grip point just within reach. This scramble animation makes you feel as though you worked for it, providing a sense of achievement, even though raised platforms are almost always accessible. The game is working with you.\n\u201cIn instances where the player is not entirely sure if they can get somewhere but decide to try anyway, 90% of the time they are going to succeed,\u201d says game designer Dan Pearce, director at Four Circle, and fellow Respawn fan. \u201cEverything in Apex is balanced like this, the same way that bullets in Halo curve slightly to hit their target, or Mario has about half a second where he can still jump after running off the edge of a surface.\u201d\nAnother aspect Dan and I both like is the decision to go with three-player squads, rather than the four-person teams favoured by Fortnite or Call of Duty. It means no one can be carried \u2013 everyone has to work together and be a functional part of any strategy. \u201cThree players also means it\u2019s really easy to set up a balanced rock/paper/scissors-style team, where someone\u2019s focused on traversal, someone\u2019s focused on aggression, someone\u2019s focused on defence,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cThree players is also a small enough group that, if you were really in the zone, you could conceivably take out a whole squad single-handed.\u201d\nBut the masterstroke in terms of cooperative play is the game\u2019s ping system, which allows players to highlight areas of the map, useful items and enemy locations to their team-mates without talking. This, together with a conversation wheel offering a range of tactical phrases, means that it\u2019s possible to play as a squad with strangers without having to use your voice, which is intimidating and opens you to the possibility of abuse \u2013 or unwanted noise. \u201cIt is a genuine blessing for games culture,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cI might never again have to awkwardly describe an enemy\u2019s location over the sound of a stranger\u2019s barking dog while I\u2019m being riddled with bullets.\u201d\nHaving spent a lot of time wandering the two Apex Legends maps \u2013 King\u2019s Canyon and World\u2019s Edge \u2013 what I\u2019ve noticed is how functional the architecture and topography are; how they work together to provide fun little playgrounds, choke points and risk centres. The icy slides down to the Epicenter, the slim, lava-surrounded walkways of the Dome, the wide, densely overlooked streets of Capitol City. In a game with such extravagance in terms of weapon design and character special abilities, you need each area of the environment to provide strict and specific roles. Respawn\u2019s approach to staging is more theatrical than cinematic.\n\u201cThere\u2019s incredibly little that is extraneous in the designs,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cAlmost nothing is there just because it looks cool. Every Respawn game so far has felt to me like it could be played with blocky prototype graphics and still be just as involving, because every element justifies its inclusion mechanically. This kind of puzzle-box design, where everything clicks together in such a deliberate way, is harder to come across in games with larger scopes. Respawn isn\u2019t the only developer doing this \u2013 Remedy\u2019s Control felt similar to me, but it is rare in the big-budget, triple-A space.\u201d\nBut what I really love about Apex Legends is the simple, unimpeded pleasure of moving through the world. Lots of game designers are very interested in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of flow, a highly focused mental state in which actions become almost automatic. Assisting flow is one of the most underappreciated elements of design \u2013 it might be found in the way a game illuminates certain areas in the world to show where the player should go (Dead Space does this brilliantly), or the use of rumble feedback to indicate the edges of a road in a racing game. But what Apex Legends does is reduce friction in a way that makes the player feel skilful.\n\u201cI think this is why Apex has found so much success, even among players who don\u2019t usually enjoy battle royale games,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for players to feel overwhelmed when they\u2019re being introduced to these games, but Respawn balances everything to make the player feel about 20% more competent and cognisant than they are.\u201d\nOf course, I have to deal with the realisation that the game I\u2019ve played the most this year is the one that\u2019s designed to flatter me. But, 500 hours in, I don\u2019t really care.",

        "content": "Digital microfinance has made it possible for the prosperous to help developing world entrepreneurs with capability but no capital\nWhen Typhoon Haiyan laid waste the central Philippines in 2013, Bernadeth Cabusog was one of the many people whose lives were turned upside down. Her smallholding was wrecked and with it, her family\u2019s main means of provision. \u201cIt was the hardest time of our lives,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAll our vegetables were destroyed. We really needed some help.\u201d\nCabusog took the advice of a neighbour in her village in rural Cebu province and approached Lamac, a local agricultural co-operative. Lamac lent her around $450 to replant her crops of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes, allowing her to defer half of its repayment until she was back on her feet again. \u201cI was just so thankful that they were there to help me. I felt like God had a purpose for me after all,\u201d she says.\nSeven years later, Cabusog has just repaid her fifth loan of $1,900, which went towards fertiliser and other farm equipment, to Lamac. She sells her produce through the co-operative and employs two people. Some of the money will help fund the wages of more workers she plans to hire this year.\nWhile her loan was administered by Lamac, the funds came from Lendwithcare, one of several nonprofit microfinance sites where small investors can help entrepreneurs in developing countries by crowdfunding loans.\nMillions of people in developing countries depend on microloans to raise the funds to grow a business or just stay afloat in hard times. And thanks to digital platforms, smartphones and free-moving global capital, growing numbers of people in the rich world are using their money to lift others out of poverty.\nIn the decade or so they have been around, nonprofit microlenders have become big business. Kiva, the Silicon Valley-based market leader, has around $158m (\u00a3120m) invested by 639,000 lenders to more than 400,000 borrowers, according to its 2018 figures.\nMore modestly but no less impressively, Lendwithcare has lent \u00a327m in total to 127,000 borrowers. Its recent funding targets include a baker in Ecuador looking to replace a mixer, an embroiderer in Pakistan seeking to stock up on cloth, and a taxi rider in Rwanda hoping to purchase a new moped \u2013 the kind of small individual ventures that can make a big difference in poor communities.\nCritically with Kiva and Lendwithcare investors cannot make a profit \u2013 so once funding targets are met, the sites can forward on the microloan interest-free. When (and occasionally if) the loan is paid back, lenders are free to withdraw their initial investment \u2013 but most end up returning it to a new project.\nMicrofinance was conceived as a solution to world poverty by offering people in developing countries reliable access to loans and other financial products. But, 15 years since the idea caught hold, the question that perpetually dogs the sector is whether it actually works.\nBy some measures, extreme poverty appears to be falling. According to the most recent UN estimates, in 2015 10% of the world\u2019s population lived at or below the World Bank\u2019s extreme poverty line of $1.90 a day \u2013 down from 16% in 2010 and 36% in 1990. But how much of this trend can be attributed to the effects of microfinance? The microfinance sector has grown into a financial behemoth, with overall loans in 2018 estimated by the World Bank at $112bn to 120 million borrowers.\nBut Dr Philip Mader, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies who has looked at the sector extensively, says that, while microfinance has created more financial products in developing countries and encouraged generosity from the rich world, there is no clear evidence that microloans do, on average, lift people out of poverty.\n\u201cThere are always going to be exceptional individuals for whom a loan was a single breakthrough factor, but most people just aren\u2019t natural entrepreneurs,\u201d says Mader. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to get by, and at the end of next year, they\u2019re going to be where they were before. Some people are going to be worse off as well. Loans are risky. That\u2019s important to consider.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a point acknowledged by Ajaz Ahmed Khan, the senior microfinance adviser at Care International, Lendwithcare\u2019s umbrella organisation. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this sort of world for 30 years, but I\u2019ve never been convinced that any one thing is a panacea,\u201d he says. \u201cPoverty is far too complicated for one simple intervention to remedy everything.\u201d\nKiva is the slickest of the microfunding websites, offering a mind-bogglingly glossy catalogue of projects sorted into different categories, countries and attributes, all illustrated with backstories and pictures. It\u2019s clear that this sense of connection between lender and borrower is a big part of the urge to invest.\nBut the reality is often a lot messier \u2013 something that may not initially be obvious to the lender. In fact, like Cabusog and Lendwithcare, borrowers and crowdfunding sites connect via local partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) who do the essential work of assessing creditworthiness and administering loans. To pay for that, most MFIs charge interest to borrowers, often at wildly varying rates.\nFurthermore, many lenders have been surprised to find the money being crowdfunded on Lendwithcare or Kiva is often already in the borrower\u2019s pocket, lent by a local MFI long before the loan target has been met. There are good practical reasons for this, explains Kathy Guis, Kiva\u2019s director of partner investments. \u201cOften borrowers have urgent financial needs, for example, to purchase perishable goods for resale,\u201d she says. \u201cSo for entrepreneurs to wait two or three months for Kiva to send that money to the [MFI] partner just wouldn\u2019t actually be useful.\u201d\nStill, the reality is that in many cases a lender\u2019s individual investment is simply going towards a partner MFI\u2019s general portfolio, rather than directly to the loanee. Both Kiva and Lendwithcare do spell this out in the small print on their sites, Kiva in particular having been accused of not being clear enough about this in the past. It\u2019s just not quite as straightforward as you might first think.\n \nEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on \nconfrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?\nThis\n series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope,\n as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that \nmight and innovations whose time might have come.\nReaders can recommend other projects, people and progress that we \nshould report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com\nIn the end, though, does this really matter? Goldie Chow, Kiva\u2019s director of impact, says that a sense of connection is key to the urge to lend. \u201cKiva is a platform to democratise impact investing,\u201d Chow says. \u201cWhen you come on the website, it looks very simple, it looks very clean and very easy. But the fact of the matter is that to manage the $150m of loans that we do every year, we have to have really onerous systems and levers and monitoring processes in place.\u201d\nWhile the work carried out by local MFIs is generally necessary and cost-consuming, the malpractice of some operators has also cast a shadow over the industry. A recent Guardian investigation into a microfinance programme run in Sierra Leone by Brac, the world\u2019s largest NGO, found its staff were failing to fully explain loans to borrowers, or ensuring they could afford the payments.\nSeparately, a report last year by Licadho, one of Cambodia\u2019s leading human rights organisations, highlighted numerous cases of MFIs preying on borrowers. It detailed widespread reckless lending practices from local credit officers in offering loans to clients who were clearly unable to repay them, and who were then pressured to sell land to clear debt. It also revealed that at least a million Cambodian borrowers had been forced to offer their land or homes as security to MFIs.\nKiva and Lendwithcare both say they take stringent measures to avoid exposure to such bad practice. Khan says that Lendwithcare\u2019s MFI partners tend to be NGOs and co-operatives and its due diligence visits typically last seven to 10 days, including full policy and procedure reviews. \u201cSometimes, despite all the research and country visits, we decide not to proceed,\u201d he says, highlighting recent visits to Tanzania, Guatemala and Egypt as examples.\nOn its website, Kiva says it will not partner with organisations that charge unreasonable interest rates, and that it requires field partners to fully disclose their rates. \u201cKiva only partners with organisations and microfinance institutions that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved,\u201d it says.\nIf rogue MFIs are often perceived as the problem, would it be possible to do without them? Around 2006, Julia Kurnia had that very thought while working for a small NGO in Senegal, when she saw first-hand how expensive microloans could be for borrowers.\n\u201cWe had started a microfinance bank and hired a loan officer,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe would have to travel to the villages and collect money. That was very expensive relative to the small size of loans. But even though we tried to be as frugal as we could \u2013 I was there as a volunteer \u2013 we could never get the operating cost below about a third of the value of the loans.\u201d\nThe result was that Kurnia founded Zidisha, a peer-to-peer lending service that cuts out the middleman altogether by utilising cheap mobile phone money transfer services to connect borrower to lender directly. Borrowers pay a 5% fee to Zidisha to cover its operating costs, but that\u2019s it. Since it was founded in 2009, it has lent around $16.7m to more than 380,000 members.\nZidisha uses algorithms to assess potential borrowers for default risk and for possible fraud: \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem we have to solve as an internet service that doesn\u2019t have people on the ground,\u201d says Kurnia. She admits the absence of an MFI to mediate could result in a higher risk of default, though she says Zidisha offers a guarantee to lenders of up to $1,000.\nThe traditional microlenders think that harnessing big data will be the key to lowering the cost of borrowing in the developing world. Kiva is using blockchain technology in Sierra Leone to create an online ID database so that loan applicants outside the formal banking system can prove their credit history, and it hopes to extend the system to other countries if successful.\n\u201cFrom the outside looking in, many people assume there\u2019s minimal economic activity in the unbanked world,\u201d says Kiva\u2019s chief strategy officer, Matthew Davie. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s a very active financial sector. The problem is all the activity in that sector never gives you credit when you move on to formal financial services.\u201d\nStill, the question remains: does microfinance really achieve the objective of lifting people out of poverty? As with the differing models of loan disbursement, the answer is complicated. \u201cBroadly speaking, I\u2019d agree that it\u2019s hard to prove,\u201d says Khan. He points out that Lendwithcare tries to supplement its loans with a range of other financial services including savings and training, so that the impact is not just focused on loans.\nOver the past five years, Lendwithcare has tried to measure the impact of its work in collaboration with the University of Portsmouth. It has found that in Pakistan, for example, household income for the low-income families it supports has risen by 30.7% since 2015. The results look encouraging \u2013 but even here, Khan says they should be treated with caution as Akhuwat, its MFI partner in Pakistan, charges no interest on its loans in accordance with Islamic practice. \u201cThe results in Zimbabwe, where the economic situation is difficult, were very mixed,\u201d he admits.\nIn the end, philanthropic investing in this form is only one in a range of options open to people wanting to help alleviate poverty \u2013 and that includes just giving money to needy individuals or to good causes.\n\u201cThere is no one thing that will help everyone living in poverty find a way out,\u201d says Kiva\u2019s Guis. \u201cCash transfers are right for some people, loans are right for others. Where I find the argument for Kiva\u2019s approach strongest is that we\u2019re tapping into money that is not earmarked for charitable giving.\u201d\nAs Mader points out, people need to consider what they want to achieve. \u201cIf people want to give directly to someone, there\u2019s a website called givedirectly.org. If they want to make sure that somebody is working hard to have a chance at poverty reduction and development, but only after having repaid interest to an intermediary lender, then yes, use Kiva.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fault anyone for giving a loan. But I\u2019m fascinated by how well Kiva and others have managed to sell the idea that the best way to do this is by funding individual entrepreneurs via loans, rather than working for broader community-based change.\u201d\nIn the Philippines, Bernadeth Cabusog is already planning for her next loan. She hopes to use it to concrete a track on her land, and to buy a motorcycle which would considerably reduce the time she spends travelling to and from the credit office in town.\n\u201cEvery day I see the difference,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore the loans, everything was so hard. Now, we have a comfortable life.\u201d\n Graham Snowdon is deputy editor of Guardian Weekly\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

        "content": "Continuing our series in which writers revisit childhood movie passions, a freshly oiled Arnold Schwarzenegger battles a camel and James Earl Jones in a wig in a surprisingly violent and fleshy fantasy\nThe pirated VHS copy of Conan the Barbarian that I cherished when I was 12 was cruddy and discoloured even before I wore it out with twice-daily viewings. The image, tinted jaundice-yellow in some places and seasickness-green in others, was striped with thorny lines of static that made you feel as though you were watching the movie through barbed wire. I knew it wasn\u2019t supposed to look like that because I\u2019d already seen it on the big screen a year earlier. One afternoon in September 1982, I had persuaded my father to take me after school to the ABC cinema in South Woodford, east London. I gave the movie the hard sell: it had Arnold Schwarzenegger, the goofy muscleman we\u2019d liked in Cactus Jack, as well as lots of whopping great swords and a baddie who could turn into a snake! I showed Dad the glossy stills printed in Starburst magazine, and waved my copy of the novelisation in his face. In fact, there was only one detail I kept hidden from him: the AA certificate, which prohibited anyone under the age of 14 from seeing the film.\nI wasn\u2019t fazed. I wore my burgundy leather jacket that day and stocked up on Juicy Fruit in preparation for some emphatic gum-chewing. Those factors alone would surely be enough to add three years to my age. The danger as I saw it was not that I would be refused entry but that I might very well be mistaken for James Dean.\nThat wasn\u2019t quite how it panned out. The woman at the ticket desk gave me the once over.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not 14,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Dad replied. \u201cSo what?\u201d\nShe broke the bad news while Dad took a step back from the counter. He sighed heavily, huffing and puffing and saying \u201cDear-oh-law\u201d and \u201cWe drove all this way\u201d and \u201cOh blimey\u201d, which I knew was serious because in our family we didn\u2019t say \u201cblimey.\u201d We said \u201cblimus.\u201d It was a Carry On Cleo joke.\nMy father is an East End geezer straight out of central casting: shaved head, rough edges, bags of front. The sort of firework you don\u2019t want going off indoors. But I had seen him angry plenty of times and this wasn\u2019t the real deal: it was surprise and inconvenience worked up artificially into a performance. Possibly he had in mind a lesson learned from Mel Brooks\u2019s Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety, one of his favourite films. There\u2019s a scene where Brooks and Madeline Kahn, finding themselves on the run from the police, try to sneak through customs disguised as an elderly kvetching couple. \u201cIf you\u2019re loud and annoying,\u201d Brooks tells Kahn, \u201cpsychologically people don\u2019t notice you.\u201d And he\u2019s right. The demonstrative drunk on public transport is usually guaranteed a wealth of personal space and the pick of the best seats.\nThat must be why Dad caused enough of a fuss for the cashier to decide that it might just be easier to let us in.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cBut sit yourselves at the back, alright?\u201d\nAs we crept into the dark, the short film before the main feature was just finishing \u2013 it was a documentary about the medicinal uses of snake venom \u2013 and Conan the Barbarian was up next. Basil Poledouris\u2019s thunderous, stirring score boomed out of the crummy speakers in Screen Two and for the next couple of hours I was in a disbelieving trance. What do I remember of the film itself? Watching it again now, I can only say: pretty much everything. I can hum every note of that score. And the violence is branded on my memory, from the casually brutal killing of young Conan\u2019s mother at the start of the movie \u2013 her severed head drops past the camera in a blur while the boy is still holding her hand \u2013 to the sight of Schwarzenegger punching a camel. (You will search in vain for a \u201cno animals were harmed during the making of this film\u201d disclaimer in the end credits.)\nWhat I hadn\u2019t minded at the time was John Milius\u2019s laborious direction, or the plodding, meat-and-potatoes script that is credited to him and Oliver Stone. But then in many ways this is the archetypal adolescent-boy movie, from the epigram taken from Nietzsche to the lip-smacking shots of phallic symbols (swords, snakes, arrows). Their only rival for closeups is Schwarzenegger himself, who looks adorable despite the baby-oiled, bowling-ball biceps; I\u2019m amazed to find that the schoolboy crush I had on him is revived today as I watch. There\u2019s a giddy innocence in his eyes here that would calcify within the decade into a businessman\u2019s shrewdness. He appears to be actively enjoying himself, which would be a difficult claim to make about Jingle All the Way.\nThe majestically feline, feminine aura of James Earl Jones, as the villain Thulsa Doom, is as intoxicating as ever. And how bizarre that during the climax he appoints himself Conan\u2019s parent (\u201cFor who now is your father if not me?\u201d) a mere two years after that same rumbling voice had made a not dissimilar announcement to Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back.\nIt had slipped my mind that the late Max von Sydow pops up as King Osric, exuding gravitas despite looking, in his fur-trimmed crown and robe, like a skid-row Santa. But I hadn\u2019t forgotten all the flesh on display. So much naked flesh! I\u2019d never seen anything like it. There\u2019s even a full-blown orgy scene where, rather quaintly, the organisers have supplied an enormous cauldron of steaming pea soup. Has anyone ever fancied a bowl of soup after an evening of group sex? I can\u2019t answer that. Nor can I explain how I survived the embarrassment of watching that orgy scene at the age of 11 with my dad sitting beside me. Blimus, indeed.",

On New Year\u2019s Eve more than half a total day\u2019s calls come in just a six-hour period in the evening, at a rate of about 9,000 per hour.\nBT said it has increased staff numbers to make sure all 999 calls are being answered quickly, and that call numbers have stabilised.\nThe UK on Wednesday recorded the most daily deaths to date \u2013 938, close to the peaks seen in Italy and Spain \u2013 with the peak expected to be more than a week away.\nAllera said BT had been working with the Silicon Valley giants to take down conspiracy group pages and sites circulating false claims about 5G.\n\u201cIt is completely unfounded, there is not a shred of evidence linking 5G or any mobile technology to any illness,\u201d he said. \u2018We have worked hard with Facebook and Google and YouTube to take down these sites that are putting out these messages that are not true.\u201d\nEarlier this week rival Vodafone revealed the volume of calls to the NHS 111 helpline had surged by 400% since coronavirus became a national health crisis.\nVodafone, which provides the lines and handles the call traffic for the NHS 111 call centre, said it had doubled capacity to handle 2,400 calls simultaneously.",

        "content": "No one would claim they\u2019d rather have the Ravens player on their team over Tom Brady. But there\u2019s an argument he\u2019s better at his position than anyone else\nWhen it came time for the NFL to name its all-decade team for the 2010s, it was no surprise that the Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker was an unanimous choice. There\u2019s an argument that of all the players selected for the team, the best of the lot was Tucker.\nWe should perhaps clarify that statement. No one would argue that they\u2019d rather have Tucker on their team than other unanimous picks such as Tom Brady, Aaron Donald and JJ Watt. But was Tucker a better kicker in the 2010s than Brady was a quarterback or Aaron Donald a defensive lineman? It\u2019s certainly not hyperbole to suggest he is the greatest of all-time at his position. After all Tucker is the most accurate kicker in the history of the NFL, one of eight NFL records he owns (and that\u2019s before we get to his opera singing career). And it\u2019s not just that Tucker makes kicks, he makes them when they matter. That may well be why only Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Peyton Manning have earned more Player of the Month awards. Even Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who has coached two elite kickers in Stephen Gostkowski and Adam Vinatieri, has gone on record to call Tucker the best player at his position.\nTom Brady, Peyton Manning & Aaron Rodgers are the only #NFL players to earn more Player of the Month Awards than @jtuck9. #RavensFlock pic.twitter.com/x84fzzRR8e\nYet, there\u2019s that caveat: \u201cat his position.\u201d There\u2019s an element of damning with faint praise here. No matter how skilled he is at his craft, Tucker will always be \u201conly\u201d a kicker. Kickers are a vital part of any NFL team yet there are many who refuse to count them as \u201creal football players\u201d.\nPart of the problem lies within the sport itself. Like an elite relief pitcher in baseball, kickers are only brought in when the situation calls for them. While offensive and defensive players play together as a unit, a kicker comes into a game with all eyes on him. After seeing 11 players on each side go after each other, the action stops so that a lone individual can attempt to kick a ball through the uprights. Football briefly mutates into a radically different \u2013 and much less physical \u2013 game.\nThat\u2019s the other thing too. While they are vulnerable during kickoffs, kickers mostly have the luxury of avoiding the violence that defines the sport. The life of a kicker in comparison to, say, that of a running back or a linebacker is a relatively tranquil one: the pressure they face tends to be more of the internal variety.\nBecause of this, it\u2019s easier to overlook just how talented kickers such as Tucker are. Few of us watching an NFL game can genuinely picture ourselves trying to tackle a professional football player or attempting to throw a perfect spiral to a receiver while gigantic defenders attempt to take us down. We can, however, easily imagine ourselves kicking a football. In comparison, it feels like a rather cushy job.\nThis, of course, is ridiculously wrongheaded. Like all professional athletes, NFL kickers are a different breed than the vast majority of us. It\u2019s not just about leg strength, although that alone would disqualify the majority of us from getting anywhere near an NFL game. There\u2019s also a huge amount of skill, strategy and relentless practice.\nAll of this is without getting into the mental side of the equation. While his teammates have the luxury of being part of a unit, the kicker has nowhere to hide. When it\u2019s their time to get in the game, every single eye will be on them. Beyond that, with the exception of extremely long field goals (ones outside of 50-yard range) a kicker\u2019s job is basically to be perfect, as most field goal attempts are taken for granted, points just waiting to be scored. The kicker either does what he\u2019s supposed to do or screws up, there is no moment of triumph. When a kicker\u2019s name is trending on Twitter there\u2019s a 90% chance that it is extremely bad news for the player in question.\nThen there is the end of game pressure. Other than the quarterback, no other player on the roster is more likely to have a game fall on their shoulders during the closing moments. There is barely a Sunday that goes by without one game where the outcome comes down to a late field goal. NFL games \u2013 heck, entire seasons \u2013 regularly come down to a single kick. When a kicker misses in a key spot, there\u2019s usually nobody else to blame and their previous successes count for nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of career the kicker has had to that point, it only takes a handful of misses for a team to move on to another candidate. Job security is rough for everybody in the NFL, where there are few guaranteed contracts, but kickers are probably the most disposable commodity of all.\nThis, appropriately enough, takes us back to Tucker who might just be the exception that proves the rule, a rare kicker who has made himself indispensable. The Ravens have recognized this. In 2016 they put the franchise tag on him, the kind of move that teams normally reserve for star quarterbacks, before signing him to a $16m extension. They signed him to an additional $20m four-year extension last year, not bad for a player who went undrafted out of college. It will probably be worth it: while having a great kicker won\u2019t necessarily win you games, not having one will probably lose you some.\nAs of right now, there are only two players who are in the Hall of Fame who were exclusively kickers during their careers: Jan Stenerud and Morten Andersen, with Vinatieri likely to join their ranks. Given where he is now, Tucker is in a prime position to not just join them but to solidify his position as the best kicker of all time. Hopefully, this distinction will force people to mention his name when discussing all-time great players. Even if he is \u201conly\u201d a kicker.",

        "content": "A summary of the major developments in the coronavirus outbreak across Australia\nGood evening and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Michael McGowan bringing you the main stories on Thursday 9 April.\nThe federal government\u2019s $130bn wage subsidy package provides a $1,500-a-fortnight payment to employers who have suffered a significant downturn in turnover.\nBut the jobkeeper payment is limited to sole traders, full- and part-time employees, and casuals who have been with the company for 12 months or more. That means an estimated 1.1 million Australians will miss out on the payment, many of them in the entertainment and arts industries.\nThe government\u2019s expert panel on disease control has recommended against the use of a controversial anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, for treating coronavirus, directly contradicting the federal health department, which has told doctors they can prescribe it for patients.\nThe Department of Health insists that as well as being used in clinical trials, the drug, which has also been touted by US president Donald Trump, may be given \u201cin a controlled environment in the treatment of severely ill patients in hospital\u201d.\nBut the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 the peak body that manages health emergencies \u2013 said experimental use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 prevention and treatment was not recommended, and should be prescribed only as part of a clinical trial.\nAs the health minister, Greg Hunt, urges Australians to continue seeing their GPs, smaller doctor-owned general practices are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses from Covid-19.\nClinics across the country are reporting a major drop in patient numbers due to the pandemic, either because of Covid-19 fears or problems transitioning to telehealth services.\nThe federal education minister, Dan Tehan, on Thursday ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two.\nIn a letter sent to the Independent Schools Council of Australia and peak bodies in each state and territory on Thursday, Tehan said he will use Australian Education Act powers to impose a new condition on independent schools, in effect requiring them to make classroom learning available or risk losing federal funding.\nPeople who spit on New South Wales health workers, police or other public health officials during the Covid-19 pandemic could be slapped with a $5,000 on-the-spot fine.\nThe NSW police minister, David Elliott, said on Thursday that people who intentionally spit or cough on police officers during the pandemic could also face prosecution and up to six months in prison.\n  \u201cLike most people, I find the recent actions of a handful of individuals utterly foul and obnoxious, but worryingly, the behaviour is potentially life-threatening.\u201d\nElliott said the fines had been introduced in response to the \u201cabhorrent\u201d acts of some individuals in recent weeks.\nThe NRL intends to get back on the playing field on 28 May but there is still no clarity on what the competition will look like once the 2020 season restarts.\nMeetings of the league\u2019s innovation committee and the ARL Commission were held on Thursday before ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce confirmed the intention to get the league back underway in seven weeks\u2019 time.\nThe announcement came just hours after Channel Nine aimed a scathing broadside at the league, accusing it of \u201cmismanagement\u201d and squandering millions of dollars over a number of years.\nCarnival season in western Germany, Mardi Gras in New Orleans and backpacker parties in Bondi.\nAll of the countries hit by the Covid-19 pandemic have reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company \u2013 holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass \u2013 which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic.\nA hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d, it has become clearer that the dynamics behind the virus\u2019s rapid expansion across the globe has relied heavily on the \u201ccluster effects\u201d of those gatherings.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions\nCoronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics\nAustralia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines\nFree childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?\nAm I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

        "content": "One year after coming forward about systemic abuse in Canadian soccer, former Irish international Ciara McCormack continues to fight for accountability\nOne year after going public about abuse, manipulation, and inappropriate behavior by a Canada national team coach, former player Ciara McCormack\u2019s fire is still burning even if the country\u2019s governing body continues to ignore the issue.\nA blog post by McCormack 12 months ago shined a light on how Canada Soccer \u2013 the governing body of the sport in the country \u2013 and Major League Soccer club Vancouver Whitecaps had failed to adequately address decade-long allegations by 14 high-level players of abuse by an elite coach working for both their organizations.\nAlthough the coach left Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps by \u201cmutual consent\u201d after a flawed internal enquiry at the time, he was still allowed to continue working with female youth players in Canada.\nFollowing poor publicity and protests by fans at the club\u2019s apparent inaction, the Whitecaps released a report to the public in December last year that effectively absolved the club of any wrongdoing in how it had addressed the allegations of abuse.\n\u201cAt the end of the day no one was held accountable for anything and a national team coach who was fired for sexually harassing players went right back into the community to coach for another 10 years,\u201d McCormack told the Guardian. \u201cYou can do the most atrocious things and not be held accountable.\u201d\nMcCormack, a Canadian-born former Ireland international, had an extensive professional career in Canada, Denmark, Norway, the United States and Australia, and played for the Vancouver Whitecaps Women until the team folded in 2012.\nAs reported by the Guardian, McCormack and 13 former Under-20 Canada internationals detailed events that took place in 2008 while Bob Birarda was coach of both the U-20 national team and Vancouver Whitecaps Women side.\nTheir allegations ranged from rubbing a player\u2019s thigh in a car, sending sexually suggestive text messages to players, demanding one-on-one meetings with players he had cut from his team in his hotel room, and telling a player during a half-time talk how he thought her body looked in a wet white team jersey.\nThe Guardian\u2019s report prompted more players and team administrators to speak out about their experience. Eden Hingwing, who played under Birarda for both the Canada women\u2019s Under-20 international team and the Vancouver Whitecaps in 2008 said: \u201cI watched what was a very professional environment created by the previous coach change into something extremely toxic and confusing.\u201d\nBirarda left Canada Soccer and Vancouver Whitecaps in late 2008 by \u201cmutual consent\u201d but was still able to coach female youth soccer teams in British Columbia without any sanctions. No criminal charges have been laid against him.\n\u201cThe most valuable thing to come out of this whole experience is that it created a case study for how the system is set up to not hold anyone accountable,\u201d McCormack said.\nMcCormack said that a December 2019 third-party review into the 2008 events commissioned by the Whitecaps left many questions unresolved. The review by Canadian organization Sports Law and Strategy Group cleared the Whitecaps of a \u201ccover-up\u201d and even though Vancouver Whitecaps is one of the largest and well-known soccer clubs in North America it only had \u201cauthority to prevent [Birarda] from coaching with the Whitecaps organization\u201d. The report said any further sanctions on Birarda lay at the feet of Canada Soccer.\nConcacaf president Victor Montagliani \u2013 president of Canada Soccer from 2012 to 2017 and vice president at the time of the 2008 allegations with specific responsibility for national teams \u2013 told the Guardian last year that national organizations do not deal with coach registrations and responsibility for Birarda lay with regional governing bodies or local clubs.\n\u201cThere can be all the evidence in the world right in front of everybody and [coaches like Birarda] are not forced to answer to anybody,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cPeople quit the national team because they couldn\u2019t cope with the sexualized environment that [Birarda] created. No one has been able to explain why [Birarda] was able to go unchecked even when his new club\u2019s executive director worked in the Whitecaps office in 2008. Canada Soccer has never met with us. No has been forced to answer to any of this.\u201d\n\u201cI feel good that everybody knows what happened and that this big nasty secret is out and that the spotlight has been shone on people who were operating in what they thought were dark corners,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cBut this is a case study for how unbelievably corrupt it all is. It is not about athlete health and wellbeing. It is all just words with no substance behind it.\u201d\nMcCormack said the experience of the Whitecaps and Canada U-20 team echoed that of Megan Brown, a potential Olympic-level runner who has alleged her decades-older coach at a prestigious running program at the University of Guelph groomed her for a sexual relationship. Her former coach, Dave Scott-Thomas, was suddenly fired from the university in January more than 10 years after Brown first told her story.\nSpeaking to Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, Brown said: \u201cThis is how abuse of power works \u2026 the victim has too much to lose in speaking the truth. The victim is the one who suffers, who is ostracized, who is labelled, who is forced to rebuild their life, while the person in power continues to reap the benefits of their power.\u201d\nAdds McCormack: \u201cYou can swap Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps for the University of Guelph and it is the same thing. These stories will continue. Until something significant changes, I am grateful for the experience to know that the whole system and these people don\u2019t care. To feel silenced and squished down and made to feel so little. \u2026 I wanted to see if the report would make a difference but of course it didn\u2019t.\u201d\nNow coaching youth soccer in Los Angeles, McCormack said that, while the Whitecaps and Canada Soccer offered no support for the 2008 players, she was overwhelmed by the response from Vancouver\u2019s wider soccer community to their experiences.\nWhitecaps fans staged protests during MLS home games last year at their club\u2019s perceived inaction on the issue. Fans coordinated stadium walk outs mid-match joined by visiting supporters of Portland Timbers and Los Angeles FC in a show of solidarity.\n\u201cThe gift this gave us was being heard and that helped healing,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThe community in Vancouver showed that they do care, it valued us and they were willing to take a stand. They realized people did wrong. I hated Vancouver. It was so full of bad memories but the walkouts changed things for me. It meant that I got my city back. I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d\nCanada Soccer did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",

        "content": "Southern hemisphere neighbours have developed different strategies but both are working \u2013 for now\nMore than 35,000km (21,750 miles) of coastline was always going to be Australia\u2019s strongest advantage in keeping coronavirus at bay, but even so, the speed with which it was used was breathtaking.\nWithout warning on Thursday 19 March, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced: \u201cAustralia is closing its borders to all-non citizens\u201d. The ban was effective from 9pm the next day.\nThat left visitors and visa holders stranded mid-journey, or turned around at the border and packed back on to planes, and left hundreds of thousands of Australians scrambling to get home, many of whom remain stuck in countries similarly locked down or without flights home.\nAustralia and neighbouring New Zealand, almost unique among anglophone countries, have so far been successful in largely suppressing the spread of Covid-19 within their countries, and in particular, keeping deaths low.\nAustralia, with a population of 25 million, has had just over 6,000 infections, and 50 deaths. New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, which closed its borders the day before Australia, has had 1,200 infections and so far only one death from Covid-19.\nBoth countries have enacted strict physical distancing regimes, enforced by police. Planes have been grounded, workers have been told to stay home, schools have been closed in some places, and entire industries put into hibernation.\nAcross most of both countries, it is unlawful to be outside without the \u201creasonable excuse\u201d of essential shopping, medical care, exercise, or compassionate grounds. In both countries, the majority of confirmed cases have originated overseas. Community transmission remains, by international comparison, low\u2013 less than 10% of all confirmed cases.\nAnd in both countries, the early decision, and the capability, to enforce a total lockdown of borders has proven crucial, buying valuable time to prepare, and allowing both nations to flatten the trajectory of their Covid-19 infection curves.\n\u201cWe have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas, whether it be initially in China in Wuhan, or in New York in the United States, or Italy, or Spain, or even the United Kingdom,\u201d Morrison said this week. \u201cBut we must hold the course. We must lock in these gains.\u201d\nAustralia has inherent advantages. If a country were to be designed to withstand a viral pandemic such as Covid-19, it would look very much like Australia: geographically distant, a large island nation with borders than can be locked down, inhabited by a comparatively small population that lives, in the main, in low-density cities.\nAustralia is wealthy, too, with a highly developed public health system, and a government sufficiently solvent to be able to turn on the tap of public monies to get its population through the months of lockdown. Legislation for $130bn (\u00a365bn) in wage subsidies for those who have lost jobs because of the pandemic was passed by parliament this week, on top of $84bn in economic stimulus promised earlier.\nAustralia also has had the advantage of watching the Covid-19 pandemic unfold in other countries. The delay has given it time to prepare its public health system \u2013 additional beds and staff have been readied for the coming peak\u2013 as well as its public. Internal restrictions have also been put in place. Australia\u2019s states have closed their borders to each other for the first time since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.\nThere have been significant and severe missteps, the most egregious being the decision in March to allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock at Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, allowing more than 2,700 passengers to disembark without testing, despite there being people with Covid-19 infections onboard.\nThat ship is now responsible for more than 660 infections \u2013 10% of Australia\u2019s total \u2013 and at least 15 deaths. The New South Wales (NSW) and federal governments have since spent weeks blaming each other and the cruise ship company for the debacle: the decision is now the subject of a criminal investigation by police.\nAnother misstep was at Sydney airport. Just as physical distancing laws were being imposed across the country, social media videos showed border force officials corralling arriving passengers from all over the world to wait in cramped halls and tight queues.\nApart from the impact of these failures on infection rates, they have damaged public confidence in the government\u2019s measures. Just as the country, state by state, was being put into lockdown, governments were undermining their own messages to self-isolate to save lives.\nThere has been, too, overreaction. In NSW, a man was fined by police for sitting on a park bench and eating a kebab. In Victoria, a learner driver practising with her mother was given a $1,600 fine, later rescinded after a backlash.\nBut Australians have, by and large, tolerated the imposition of lockdowns.\nAfter thousands gathered at Bondi Beach on a warm autumnal Friday evening in March, it was summarily shut down and put under police guard. With occasional defiance, it has remained eerily deserted since.\nTen days after New Zealand\u2019s centre-left government closed its borders to foreign nationals it introduced some of the toughest lockdown measures in the world. No one had yet died and cases had just passed 100.\n\u201cStay home, save lives,\u201d the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, urged her citizens, ordering them to remain in their homes for a month. \u201cThe situation here is moving at pace, and so must we. The trajectory is very clear, act now or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere.\u201d\nArdern said the worst-case scenario was \u201csimply intolerable\u201d \u2013 up to 80,000 dead, modelling predicted \u2013 representing the greatest loss of life in New Zealand\u2019s history. \u201cI will not take that chance,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cWe\u2019re going hard and we\u2019re going early.\u201d\nThe nation was given two days to prepare, panic buying was widespread. But when the moment came \u2013 effective house arrest for the majority of the population \u2013 there was absolute quiet on the streets.\nDespite their reputation for having an independent streak and a benign disdain for authority, New Zealanders have been overwhelmingly compliant with the restrictive measures, with a total of 367 breaches recorded by police. Eager surfers and mountain bikers have caused the most persistent headaches, according to the police commissioner.\nNew Zealand is one of the few countries worldwide to pursue an \u201celimination\u201d strategy, and the plan has the backing of the scientific community, many of whom want the country to stay in a version of lockdown until a vaccine can be deployed.\nDavid Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said: \u201cWe could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks \u2026 we still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly.\u201d\nFellow Otago epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker is one of the key architects behind New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus defence plan. He says an elimination strategy is well suited to an island state, where borders can be swiftly and effectively closed.\nWriting in the New Zealand Medical Journal, Baker said the strategy would save lives, but at huge social and economic cost, particularly \u201cfor those with the fewest resources\u201d. \u201cNew Zealand society has made a large \u2018upfront\u2019 sacrifice in pursuing an elimination strategy,\u201d he said.\nFor the first 12 days of lockdown, the numbers of cases rose steadily, as predicted by health officials. But cases have been steadily declining, and the prime minister has said she is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the strategy is working.\nOn Wednesday, New Zealand recorded its lowest number of new cases in a fortnight, one day after testing a record number of people. More people are now recovering from the disease than being infected by it, an \u201cencouraging milestone\u201d, the country\u2019s director general of health said.\nAttention and anticipation is turning to a gradual exit from lockdown in late April. Ardern has said it is likely some regions of the country will remain in total lockdown, while regions with few or no cases will ease into more freedoms.

At that time, just as the coronavirus started its rapid spread in China and beyond, Disney+ had 28.6 million subscribers.\nDisney\u2019s numbers are flattered through a number of offers with telecoms companies where it is given free to subscribers for a year. In India, for example, it gained 8 million subscribers overnight by being bundled with its existing Hotstar streaming service. Nonetheless, streaming services are booming, with global usage estimated to be up by 20%.\nWhile coronavirus has brought much of the economy grinding to halt, the already crowded streaming market is seeing a flurry of launches. Earlier this week the mobile-first streaming service Quibi, created by Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, pressed ahead with its international launch.\nThe service, backed by $1.8bn in funding with investors including ITV and the billionaire Walton family, has signed up stars including Steven Spielberg, Idris Elba and Jennifer Lopez to make shows of not more than 10 minutes an episode, and films broken into \u201cquick bite\u201d segments.\nRoku, a free streaming service that has proved hugely popular in the US, debuted the Roku Channel in the UK earlier this week. The service, in which Sky holds a stake, offers British fare including Skins, Homes under the Hammer and films such as Les Mis\u00e9rables.\nLater this month another US import, Acorn TV, which competes with BritBox in the US, will arrive in the UK.\nAcorn, which targets Anglophiles in the US, has shows including Foyle\u2019s War, Keeping the Faith and Agatha Christie\u2019s And Then There Were None. At \u00a34.99, it is \u00a31 a month cheaper than BritBox.",

On a three-month rolling basis, the economy grew by 0.1% between December and February.\nThe services sector, which encompasses industries from banking to restaurants, posted 0% growth in the month. The manufacturing industry, hit hard by Brexit uncertainty during much of 2019, bounced back to grow by 0.5% in February, but the construction industry recorded a dive in activity of 1.7% related to bad weather across the country.\nSamuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the stagnation of GDP in the first two months of 2020 showed that talk of a post-election Boris bounce \u201cwas just hot air\u201d.\n\u201cFebruary\u2019s data are largely free of any Covid-19 impact, with only travel agents and warehouse operators noting a material hit to demand or supply,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAdmittedly, the small month-to-month drop in GDP was driven largely by a hefty 1.7% decline in construction output, which can be attributed to exceptionally high rainfall, an unprecedented three times its seasonal norm. Nonetheless, sluggishness was broad-based, with services output flat and industrial production merely rising by 0.1%.\u201d\nRob Kent-Smith from the Office for National Statistics said another measure of the weak state of the economy was a sharp decline in imports from the EU.\n\u201cThe underlying trade balance moved into surplus in the latest three months, the first seen since comparable records began over 20 years ago. This surplus was caused by a large fall in goods imported from EU countries,\u201d he said.\nThe general secretary of trade union body the TUC, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cEven before the coronavirus crisis hit, our economy needed a change of direction.\n\u201cWhile the priority now is to contain the spread of the virus, today\u2019s figures highlight the need for a robust recovery strategy. We must tackle longstanding economic inequalities, not reinforce them.\u201d",

They had peaked a couple of years earlier, when Denman defied a crushing burden to win his second Hennessy and Kauto Star pulled an astonishing 36 lengths clear of the King George field.\nEach year, they would take each other on in the Gold Cup and their anticipated battle was constantly debated during the months of buildup. But the head-to-head struggle we all hoped to see just didn\u2019t happen.\nKauto Star couldn\u2019t lay a glove on the other horse after an interrupted preparation in 2008 and their tussle was as one-sided in the other direction the next year, after Denman\u2019s heart problems. In the 2010 race, Kauto Star fell at the fourth-last and Denman was bested by the upstart Imperial Commander. \u201cOh well,\u201d we all sighed. \u201cThe end of an era...\u201d\n By the time Cheltenham rolled around again both horses were 11, which is clearly too old for a modern Gold Cup against super-fit rivals. There hadn\u2019t been a winner of that age since the race was broadcast in black and white.\nStill, it was great to have them back in the lineup for the fourth year in a row, which by itself was a tribute to the skills of their Somerset-based trainer, Paul Nicholls. They had both been through a lot by that stage but their enthusiasm for the game never waned. They coped with life in their different ways, the chipper and gregarious Kauto taking an interest in whatever was happening around him, while the misanthropic Denman turned his powerful backside toward any visitors.\nAnyone could see they were still coping at halfway in the Gold Cup, lobbing along on the heels of the leaders, seemingly unstressed by the race\u2019s relentless pace. Behind them, talented animals were working hard to stay in touch, like Carruthers, who would win the Hennessy later that year, and Neptune Collonges, destined to end his career with Grand National victory.\nAs they turned away from the stands to begin the final circuit, Ruby Walsh let Kauto Star stride into the lead and the crowd cheered its approval. With his pricked ears and evident willingness, the old horse seemed ageless, gliding along the back straight while the pursuing group got smaller and smaller.\nAnd then, as they raced back downhill, it happened. Denman, paceless but resolute, had plodded his way into contention and now moved alongside his stablemate as Imperial Commander, who had misjudged the fourth-last, dropped out. Here it was, at long last, when we had given up hope: Denman and Kauto Star, shoulder to shoulder at the turn for home.\nThey looked so like themselves in those 30 seconds they shared the Gold Cup lead, Kauto Star coasting, doing it all on raw ability while the Stakhanovite Denman kept up an extraordinary work rate to stay alongside. It was a delicious moment, four years in the making.\nBut 11 really is too old to win a Gold Cup and Long Run proved it by sweeping past them on the approach to the final fence. This was as it should be, since he was the exciting young talent of the moment, barely half their age. It felt absolutely right the veterans had one last, thrilling spin around the stage and then, in departing, had lent some of their lustre to the sport\u2019s new hero. That\u2019s how the world looked at the time, anyway.\nIn fact, Long Run became disappointing, for reasons that were hard to pin down, and the amazingly durable Kauto Star achieved a couple of big-race wins at his expense the next winter.\nLike so many other classy steeplechasers, Long Run really had only one year at the absolute top of his game but he was unbeatable that day and no Gold Cup winner ever had a better supporting cast.",

        "content": "Farms forced to shut down operations as search continues for source of Covid-19 amid uncertainty over new industry rules\nJust a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province.\nIt was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says.\nBut the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China\u2019s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai\u2019s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over.\nChina put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak.\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t been told what to do, except that we can\u2019t sell or release or even cull them until further notice, so we\u2019re still keeping them, and that\u2019s been costing us about 300 yuan [\u00a334] per day for the past three months,\u201d Yongcai, 30, told the Guardian by phone.\n\u201cWe hope to transition to other types of business but until it\u2019s clear what to do with the rats, it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would need funding and the right facility for that.\u201d\nLike Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak.\nCertain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses.\nThe problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the Guardian could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats.\nYet, local governments, the state forestry and grassland administration and their provincial bureaus have encouraged and supported all sorts of wildlife farms. \u201cThe real number could be hundreds or even over a thousand kinds [of wild animal species] with no regulation,\u201d said Yin Shanchuan, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation who has long been involved in investigations with the group.\n\u201cSomehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,\u201d Yin said.\nRecently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the Guardian on 3 April.\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to invest a lot, you don\u2019t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.\u201d\nGao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China\u2019s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government.\nBut now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to \u00a323,000 per operation.\nGuanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. \u201cAfter the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,\u201d he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he\u2019ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful.\nYongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn\u2019t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he\u2019ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that\u2019s just for the impoverished household breeders,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cFor regular breeders, we\u2019re still on our own and awaiting a decision.\u201d\nWhat is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released.\nTheoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer.\nYet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China\u2019s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease.\n\u201cI am optimistic that bamboo rats won\u2019t be included in the livestock and poultry list,\u201d Aili Kang, Asia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told the Guardian. \u201cCurrently, the law does not use very biological or ecological definitions. Nor do they use a very pure [definitions] from a zoonotic disease kind of component.\u201d \n As for Yongcai, he understands that animals can carry viruses and disease, and while he previously sanitised his operation once a month, he is now required to do so each week for the rats that remain in limbo.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.\u201d",

Banks have also been told that they can\u2019t suspend cards during this period.\nIf you have a personal loan, credit card, store card, catalogue credit, guarantor loan (such as Amigo), logbook loan or home collected credit (also known as doorstep lending) you can ask for a freeze on repayments for three months.\nPayday loans are not yet covered by the rules and neither are cars bought on hire purchase or through a leasing deal. But the FCA said: \u201cWe are looking at these areas, and other specialist types of lending, and expect to announce specific proposals in due course.\u201d\nPeer-to-peer loans \u2013 such as those from Zopa and Ratesetter, do not come under the rules, although the FCA said it expects firms to help customers who are struggling. Business credit cards are also excluded from the rules.\nAs with mortgage payment holidays, these payment freezes are not free. Customers will still have to pay the accrued interest once the deferral period ends.\n OverdraftsAnyone with an arranged overdraft can ask for up to \u00a3500 of overdraft borrowing with no interest for three months. If your current arranged overdraft is below \u00a3500, you will not pay any interest on the amount of your current overdraft limit. If you don\u2019t have an overdraft, or your limit is smaller than \u00a3500, you can request a new overdraft or an increased limit, but this will be subject to normal checks on affordability.\n Credit recordsAnyone using these measures shouldn\u2019t have their credit record affected. The FCA said firms will be expected to \u201censure consumers using any of these temporary payment freeze measures will not have their credit file affected\u201d.\n When banks can refuseThe FCA has caveated its rules, saying there are situations where a lender can refuse a payment deferral. In its guidance, the FCA said: \u201cA firm should grant the customer a payment deferral for three months unless the firm determines (acting reasonably) that it is obviously not in the customer\u2019s interests to do so.\u201d\nThe FCA added that it \u201cwould obviously not be in customers\u2019 interests if it would give [them] a greater overall debt burden compared to other solutions\u201d. In these instances, the bank is expected to offer other ways to help the customer, such as reducing or waiving interest, or extending the term of the loan.\nPeople with very high interest credit cards (usually those on the lowest incomes) who are suffering problems repaying may receive extra help. \u201cFirms should review their prices to consider whether they are consistent with the obligation to treat customers fairly in the light of the exceptional circumstances arising out of coronavirus in order to ensure that they do not pose unjustifiable burdens on these customers who may be experiencing temporary payment difficulties,\u201d said the FCA.\n TimescalesCustomers who are struggling do not have to apply immediately \u2013 the FCA said they should be able to request a payment deferral at any point in the next three months.",

The fear that I might not be worthy. Here was this lauded institution, and there was me \u2013 a little farty. A little farty from light entertainment.\nThe odd thing is it\u2019s where I\u2019d always wanted to go. Had you asked me at the age of 18 where I wanted to go with my \u201cacting\u201d, I would have happily told you that I was heading for the RSC. At school, we did a Shakespeare production every year. I did them all. From playing an unnamed courtier in The Taming of the Shrew \u2013 I remember very vividly being accidentally dragged across the stage by two Alsatians dressed as hunting dogs, and snagging my tights on a nail \u2013 to playing Hamlet in my final year.\nIn fact, Hamlet saved me from being expelled. I\u2019d been caught doing the usual thing, drinking and smoking, and I believe this time the crime was compounded by \u201cthrowing up in the prefects\u2019 wastepaper bin\u201d. We were halfway through rehearsals, so my English teacher pleaded on my behalf (well, his behalf, too) and persuaded the headmaster to let me stay. Naturally I was a triumph \u2013 darling!\nI went on to study drama at Manchester University, still pretty sure that the RSC was where I was destined to be. Then came the thorny problem of equity cards and the closed-shop union. No job without a card, no card without a job. There was a rumour that doing \u201clunchtime theatre\u201d at a pub called The Band on the Wall might provide something called variety contracts, which somehow provided a back door into Equity. Rik Mayall and a couple of chums and I decided we\u2019d give this a go. But what to perform? We had no time to learn a new play every week. We\u2019d improvise! Easy. And ... well some of you can probably see where this is going \u2013 a different career happened. All thoughts of the RSC receded into the distance.\nJump forward 40 years and out of the blue the director Chris Luscombe asks if I\u2019d like to play Malvolio in Twelfth Night. You\u2019d have to ask him why. We did a post-show Q&A together once, and he mentioned wanting someone with \u201cfunny bones\u201d. Because the odd thing is that Malvolio isn\u2019t a particularly humorous part. He doesn\u2019t have many actual jokes. The joke, as it were, is on him. People laugh at him. He is basically the victim of a cruel practical joke. So you need someone with funny bones to be sympathetic to all the funny stuff going on around him. It\u2019s like being a conductor for laughs. Which is why he is quite often portrayed by people with a comic sensibility \u2013 Nigel Hawthorne, Richard Briers, Richard Wilson, Stephen Fry.\nI was eager to accept, but held back long enough to consider what I could possibly do that other people hadn\u2019t. What was the point in just copying? For 40 years I\u2019d basically been creating my own stuff, or doing new stuff written by someone else \u2013 why bother repeating what so many had already done?\nSo I read the text over and over. Malvolio\u2019s involvement is actually quite short \u2013 even though he\u2019s considered the main part, it\u2019s really more of an ensemble piece, so it didn\u2019t take long! He\u2019s really only on stage for less than half an hour. I looked at the performances mentioned above, and watched Alec Guinness\u2019s stab at it. And I met with Chris to talk it through. And the line I took was that no one seemed to have played that they were really in love with Olivia. A deep, life-long, unrequited, pure love, that he would be happy to leave unrequited but for this sudden opportunity provoked by the faked letter in her handwriting.\nThere\u2019s a line in the letter: \u201cRemember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered.\u201d Which can only mean that Malvolio had worn the yellow stockings before, perhaps when she was a child, in order to amuse her. He\u2019s been with the household for years.\nChris was also keen to get musical numbers into the show, one of them being Please One and So Please All \u2013 from a line of Malvolio\u2019s in which he quotes a popular song of the time. Chris unearthed the full lyrics, Nigel Hess set them to music, and we have Malvolio singing it to himself when he is at his happiest and most hopeful \u2013 a happy memory of the joyful man he might have been, the previous wearer of yellow stockings.\nWe\u2019re all on the spectrum that ranges from dour and depressing to ridiculous and joyous. And we don\u2019t stick to the same notch on the scale the whole time. Who knows why so many people seem to willingly become so unlovable? Malvolio\u2019s a sharp-tongued, po-faced joykiller, but he can\u2019t have started out that way. He runs the household with meticulous precision. And while he\u2019s unpleasant, he never does enough to provoke the wicked prank the rest of the household pulls on him, to be left imprisoned and losing his marbles.\nThankfully we no longer find someone being bullied as hysterical as people used to. I decided that if I could get the audience to laugh at him being bullied and then feel very guilty about it in the last scene, then I would have won ... comedy and pathos are brilliant bedfellows.

Sue, a civil servant, called an ambulance 10 days after he first became ill after his breathing became very rapid.\nShe was told he would have to go straight to intensive care and be put on a ventilator and that he was \u201cvery, very sick, and they weren\u2019t sure he was going to come through it\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cHe walked out of the house and I really thought a couple of days on oxygen and he would be back home with us.\u201d\nImmediately after he was admitted, she and the children managed to FaceTime him before he was placed on a ventilator. \u201cWe just told him how much we loved him,\u201d she said.\nHer husband promised their daughter he would be at her wedding and would see his son play rugby for Wales. He then texted that he was \u201cgoing to fight it, and it was not his time, and that he was coming home\u201d, she said. Then the text messages stopped and she knew he had been taken to ICU.\n\u201cThat day really was when everything changed for us. We have just existed since,\u201d she said.\nThough she was told his chances were 50/50 at first, he then \u201ctook a dive\u201d, with his kidneys failing. \u201cThey said there was almost zero chance he was going to survive,\u201d she said. He was \u201con the brink, and they couldn\u2019t do anything more for him\u201d.\nAfter begging to see him, she described the hospital as wonderful, with one nurse waiting behind after shift to be with them. She and the children were allowed 10 minutes and had to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE). \u201cEssentially, we were going in to say our goodbyes.\u201d\n\u201cIt was like he was just asleep, although he had so many tubes and wires in him. We just told him that we loved him. And it was heartbreaking to hear the children tell him they were going to make him proud.\u201d\n\u201cWe were really glad to have that time with him.\u201d\nShe said they had fully expected Monday to be his last day but then his blood pressure went up slightly. \u201cThey have obviously made it very clear that he is still extremely, desperately ill, and there was still almost zero chance of him pulling through.\n\u201cBut that was Monday, and we are on Wednesday, and he has been the same for the last two days. No improvement. But no further deterioration,\u201d she said.",

This represents a growth in unique browsers of 86.5% compared to February, and 161% compared to this time last year. Page views also grew by 91% compared to this time last year. These numbers position the Guardian as one of the fastest growing publishers in the US.\nWhile readership has increased across all coverage areas, Covid-19 coverage accounts for much of the record-setting growth. 66% of page views in the US were attributed to coronavirus content and the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus explainer is its most read article ever. Coverage on stimulus checks, the Administration\u2019s pandemic response, and the liveblog also drew substantial attention on March 30th, helping to make it the busiest traffic day ever for Guardian US.\nEvelyn Webster, CEO of Guardian US and Australia, said:\u201cA global news story demands a global perspective and with major newsrooms in the US, UK and Australia, as well as bureaus all around the world, the Guardian is uniquely positioned to deliver just that. The traffic surges we\u2019re seeing across the sector signal unprecedented demand for news, and our current reader numbers in the US make it clear that trusted, independent journalism resonates with an American audience.\nThe media sector has some challenges ahead but we\u2019re fortunate to have built a loyal and engaged audience, in large part because we\u2019ve never put up a paywall. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality journalism whether they can afford it or not, and this crisis proves just how important that mission is.\u201d\nJohn Mulholland, editor of Guardian US, said:\n\u201cThese extraordinary times are testing the entire news industry. As we tackle the biggest and most complex news story of a generation, journalists have a huge responsibility to keep people adequately informed. Our newsroom approach is to answer the hard questions, offer rigorous analysis, deliver expert opinion on all aspects of the crisis, and provide the facts that matter to Americans. Absolutely central to our coverage is elevating the voices of the most vulnerable communities and focusing on how Covid-19 has different impacts across race, gender and income. Our record traffic suggests our readers value this approach and we believe the strength of our journalism will give way to deeper relationships with them.\u201d\nThe record traffic for Guardian US is reflective of global traffic trends for the Guardian. With 2.17 billion page views worldwide, March saw the highest traffic ever in the Guardian\u2019s history. Guardian journalism attracted 366 million unique browsers worldwide, almost doubling the record set in February of 191 million.\nThe Guardian\u2019s comprehensive Covid-19 coverage includes a daily live blog, a data tracker, breaking news, explainers, expert analysis and much more. A new section, Life in the time of corona, provides advice and ideas for getting through the pandemic.\n\n------ ends------\n\nAbout Guardian News & Media\nGuardian US is renowned for its Pulitzer prize-winning investigation into widespread secret surveillance by the National Security Agency, and for other award-winning work including the Paradise Papers.

        "content": "French order opens abbey doors to allow what could be the largest recording project ever\nA monastery of Benedictine nuns living in seclusion in southern France has opened its doors to allow recordings of its Gregorian chants to be made available to the outside world.\nIn what is believed to be the largest recording project ever conducted, the US musician John Anderson followed the 45-strong order for three years. He installed microphones in the abbey church of Notre-Dame de Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 de Jouques near Aix-en-Provence in southern France and captured the nuns singing their eight daily \u201coffices\u201d. The result is thousands of chants, the entire Gregorian repertoire, about 7,000 hours long.\nThe Gregorian chant originated in the 8th century and spread throughout Europe. It accords to St Benedict\u2019s \u201crule\u201d, in which the day is divided into balanced divisions of manual and intellectual work, prayer and rest, starting at 5am with the chanting of matins, and concluding with compline at 8pm, followed by the \u201cgreat silence\u201d of night.\nThe Jouques nuns\u2019 lead a strict life of contemplation in which they recite the chants daily.\nThe abbey, which has its own congregation, is closed for Easter as a result of rules applied to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cBecause of the measures taken ... we can no longer admit worshippers to our abbey\u2019s church, and we are deeply sorry for it,\u201d the nuns said.\nThey have instead allowed the release of a week\u2019s worth of their chants https://www.neumz.com/ for the six days Christians refer to as holy week, preceding Easter Sunday, the highlight of the religious calendar, when the chants have a particular importance. The rest is to go live next month.\nThe chants are presented together with their simple scores, Latin texts and translations, allowing subscribers to sing together with the nuns.\nAnderson was inspired by the Gregorian chants after an aunt joined the convent and he visited her during his summer holidays from university.\n\u201cThe community is living in communion with nature and in quiet contemplation. Their life is regularised by the rhythm of prayer and work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe simple beauty of their singing\u201d had had a profound influence on him, he said, and \u201con the sensation of time, the amount of focus it was possible to achieve in such tranquillity\u201d.\nAfter negotiating with the nuns for a week, he and a sound technician suspended eight low-profile microphones in the church, which recorded into a small recorder that saved the music to SD cards.\nThe nuns pressed \u201crecord\u201d every time they entered the church and \u201cstop\u201d when they exited after each service. A 4G modem was installed at the monastery, enabling the nuns to upload the 24GB of contents to the technicians\u2019 Google Drive account every evening, from where the recordings were mixed and mastered.\nOrganised so as to be as minimally invasive to the nuns\u2019 lives, the recordings of clear unaccompanied voices are speckled with authentic sounds such as the creak of wooden benches, the occasional coughing or dropping of prayer books and bell chimes.\nAnderson, a founder of Odradek Records originally from Kansas but now living in Italy, said the launch of the project, which was eight years in the making and would raise money for the order\u2019s sister monastery in Benin, west Africa, had come at the right time, when many people were detached from their work and social contacts.\n\u201cIn these days of remote work and online social activity, we hope that listening to the chants of holy week can help bring people together, religious and non-, sharing in a sense of peace and enjoying their timeless beauty,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe sisters live this paradox already \u2013 in isolation but in continuous prayer for the rest of the world, and in community amongst themselves. These days we are maybe experiencing a similar sensation, to be physically isolated but sometimes even closer together emotionally.\u201d",

Nine grands prix have been called off because of coronavirus but the F1 sporting director, Ross Brawn, said every option is being considered and believes it may be possible to hold up to 19 races.\nThe Canadian Grand Prix became the latest race to be postponed on Tuesday. The following day the Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto, confirmed teams were willing to accede to radical changes to the racing format and to extending the season into next year if necessary. F1 faces a major financial shortfall if racing does not take place.\nThe first race set to take place is the French GP on 28 June. Brawn said F1 is making plans on the assumption of the easing of restrictions imposed across Europe.\n\u201cOur view is probably a European start will be favourable and that could even be a closed event,\u201d Brawn said in a vodcast on Sky Sports. \u201cWe could have a very enclosed environment where teams come in on charters, we channel them into the circuit, we make sure everyone is tested, cleared and that there is no risk to anyone.\n\u201cWe have a race with no spectators. That\u2019s not great but it\u2019s better than no racing at all. We have to remember there are millions of people who follow the sport sat at home. A lot of them are isolating and to be able to keep it alive and entertain people would be a huge bonus in this crisis. But we can\u2019t put anyone at risk.\u201d\nF1 had already assented to a closed-door meeting. The Bahrain GP was to be held without spectators in March. Brawn believes permanent circuits would be able to prepare for a race with a short lead time if they are not required to accommodate fans, provide marketing and organise tickets. The British Grand Prix set the end of this month as the latest point to begin preparing the circuit for the race scheduled for 19 July.\nBinotto acknowledged two-day meetings were already under discussion and Brawn revealed F1 is considering a punishing schedule to maximise the number of races.\n\u201cIf we were able to start at the beginning of July we could do a 19-race season, [It would be] tough, three races on, one weekend off, three races on, one weekend off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have looked at all the logistics.\u201d\nHe also recognised there was a finite period in which F1 could conclude a world championship. \u201cEight races is the minimum, [according to] the FIA statutes,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWe could achieve eight races by starting in October. So if you wanted a drop-dead point it would be October but there is always the possibility we could run into next year. That\u2019s being explored.\u201d",

Scientists say it may be down to genes or \u2018viral load\u2019\nIt remains one of the biggest puzzles of the Covid-19 pandemic. The disease generally causes serious problems only in older people or those with underlying health problems. But occasionally it strikes down young, apparently fit individuals, including medical staff exposed to patients with the virus.\nIn some cases, previously undiagnosed conditions are later revealed but in others no such explanations are available, leaving scientists struggling to find reasons for the behaviour of the coronavirus.\nSeveral theories have been proposed. Some researchers believe the amount of virus that infects an individual may have crucial outcomes. Get a huge dose and your outcome may be worse. Others argue that genetic susceptibility may be involved: in other words, that there are individuals whose genetic makeup leaves them more vulnerable to the virus as it spreads through their bodies.\nThis latter idea is favoured by virologist Michael Skinner at Imperial College London. \u201cIt is very possible that some of us could have a particular genetic makeup that makes it more likely that we will respond badly to an infection with this coronavirus,\u201d he said.\nAn example of such susceptibility is provided by the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores. In some people, a mutation that affects cell receptors known as TLR3, in their central nervous system, leaves them unable to deal with the worst impact of the virus: they contract a disease called herpes simplex encephalitis, which can lead to seizures and convulsions in children.\n\u201cIt could be that we are seeing a similar sort of susceptibility in some individuals who get Covid-19, and that leads them to suffer more acutely from serious side-effects,\u201d added Skinner.\nOthers, however, suggest that the amount of virus that a person is infected with could be a crucial factor in determining their outcome. Such individuals are said to be affected by a high viral load.\n\u201cA person with a high viral load has more virus particles than one with a low load,\u201d said virologist Alison Sinclair at Sussex University. \u201cWe do not yet know what impact viral load has on the symptoms of a person infected with Covid-19. Whether there is a link between a high viral load and worse outcomes is going to be important to find out.\u201d\nThis point was backed by Edward Parker at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cFor Covid-19, early reports from China suggest that the viral load is higher in patients with more severe disease, which is also the case for Sars and influenza.\n\u201cSo it is crucial for us to limit all possible exposures to Covid-19, and if we are feeling unwell we need to observe strict self-isolation measures to limit our chance of infecting others.\u201d\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

The news that top-flight clubs are to receive a share of merit payments before the end of the season indicates even the top sides are facing financial pressure.\nPrize money from the Premier League is broken down into tranches, including money based on final league position and the number of times each club appears on live TV. The league has brought forward some of that money, which would normally be paid in May.\nThe merit payments are to be based on the table as it stands. Facility fees will also be paid, based on a calculation as to likely TV appearances were the season to have continued.\nA similar advance, in solidarity payments, was agreed with the EFL last week after an extraordinary meeting of Premier League shareholders. It is understood the advance in merit payments is only a percentage of what clubs could otherwise expect to receive, given the possibility of compensation being owed to broadcast companies should the season be voided.\nThe Premier League has had discussions with its broadcast partners, Sky and BT Sport, over outcomes depending on how the season is resolved. In the meantime broadcasters are being granted greater access to players and managers to help fill the void left in schedules.\nNegotiations between top-flight clubs and their players over wage deferrals or reductions are continuing. The Premier League had hoped for a common agreement but discussions are now taking place on an individual club level with Southampton becoming the first to agree measures on Thursday after players accepted a 10% deferral of their pay.",

Last week it warned regulated radio and television stations to take extra care not to broadcast potentially damaging claims about the pandemic, with a promise to expedite investigations linked to coronavirus.\nLondon Live is controlled by Evgeny Lebedev and operates from the same offices as his newspaper titles Evening Standard and Independent.\nLondon Live defended the decision to broadcast the interview with Icke, which was edited down from an even longer online interview conducted last month by the unrelated YouTube channel London Real.\nThey said those complaining were confusing the material they broadcast with a separate interview Icke conducted with London Real this week, which was banned from YouTube for spreading potentially damaging claims about 5G mobile networks.\nA spokesperson for London Live said: \u201cWe note that several commentators on social media have complained about our decision, however, we also note those complaints are about another interview with David Icke. We did not broadcast the interview which is the subject of the complaints on social media.\n\u201cCommentators are confusing the interview broadcast last night with an interview with David Icke which was removed from YouTube. The interview London Live did broadcast is still available on YouTube. We regret if we have given any rise to this confusion.\u201d\nIn a minute-long clip of the broadcast uploaded to London Live\u2019s Twitter account, Icke insinuates a connection between coronavirus research and the Israeli state, while also claiming any moves to require people to ultimately be vaccinated for coronavirus is \u201cfascism\u201d.\nThe broadcast was prefaced with a warning from the channel that the \u201cviews contained in this programme are those of individuals articulating them and are not necessarily those of London Live\u201d.\nLondon Live is one of the local television stations introduced by the former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt almost a decade ago but has struggled to reach large audiences. Despite this it enjoys a prominent position on programme listings, which can help attract casual viewers.\nThe culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the material consisted of \u201clunatic conspiracy theories and no sensible person would give them a moment\u2019s thought \u2026 Clearly that station is regulated by Ofcom and I would be expecting Ofcom to take appropriate action.\u201d\nIcke is a former Hereford United goalkeeper who has long been of the most prominent figures in global conspiracist circles. One concern of factcheckers is that debunking baseless theories can ultimately elevate them, with Icke\u2019s supporters holding up YouTube\u2019s deletion of videos as a sign that he is right.\nWhile Ofcom can issue sanctions to regulated broadcast radio and television stations, there is currently no substantive regulation of social media output. Online broadcasts can reach a vast audience but oversight of content relies on the whims of private companies.\nThe juxtaposition between regulation of online and broadcast media is stark.

        "content": "Department store\u2019s move axes 1,200 jobs in Ireland but buys time to save UK business\nDebenhams has fallen into administration, casting fresh doubt over the future of the struggling chain, which employs more than 20,000 people.\nLike other fashion retailers, Debenhams is facing financial turmoil as the coronavirus lockdown prevents Britons from shopping. However the indebted retailer had problems prior to the health crisis and on Thursday confirmed the appointment of restructuring firm FRP Advisory to handle a \u201clight touch\u201d administration of the 142-store chain.\nDebenhams said administrators would work alongside existing management to \u201cget the business into a position to re-open and trade as many stores as possible again when restrictions are lifted\u201d. However it also warned that FRP Advisory would be putting its Irish chain into liquidation which would mean the permanent closure of 11 stores that employ around 1,260 people.\nStefaan Vansteenkiste, chief executive of Debenhams, said: \u201cWe are desperately sorry not to be able to keep the Irish business operating but are faced with no alternative option in the current environment.\u201d\nThe Irish chain, which includes four branches in Dublin and two in Cork, employed 958 Debenhams staff as well as 300 others who worked for in-store concessions. The staff have already been stood down under the Irish government\u2019s wage support scheme.\nIt was anticipated that Debenhams\u2019 owners and lenders would make additional funding available to fund the administration period, Vansteenkiste said. \u201cIn these unprecedented circumstances the appointment of the administrators will protect our business, our employees and other important stakeholders, so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.\u201d\nThe retailer\u2019s stores are all closed anyway due to the government-mandated shutdown, although its website is still operating as normal. The majority of its UK workforce has also been furloughed.\nDebenhams, which is hobbled by a \u00a3600m debt pile, was listed on the stock exchange until last April, when its deteriorating finances resulted in an administration that wiped out shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors that includes the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree.\nLike other struggling chains, it has used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cut rents and close unprofitable stores including a group of 19 shops in January. Since the coronavirus lockdown it has written to landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday and written to the suppliers to inform them they would be getting their money a month later than expected as it seeks to conserve cash.\nSofie Willmott, a retail analyst at consultancy firm GlobalData, said Debenhams\u2019 second administration in 12 months was \u201cstringing out its demise and its long-term future remains bleak\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cWith significant further investment in the business now very unlikely, it is difficult to see what will attract shoppers back once its stores can reopen.\n\u201cThe department store chain was already in trouble before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the sharp shift in consumer shopping habits will only speed up inevitable changes in the UK market. Weaker retailers without a unique selling point will be weeded out, with many unable to survive the year.\u201d\nCork - Mahon Point\n Cork - Patrick Street\n Dublin - Blackrock\n Dublin \u2013 Blanchardstown\n Dublin - Henry Street\n Dublin - Tallaght\n Galway\n Limerick\n Newbridge\n Tralee\n Waterford",

        "content": "The singer and sometime actor has embarked on a new lockdown career as a movie pundit. And, so far, she\u2019s reading the public mood perfectly\nThe coronavirus crisis hasn\u2019t been kind to performers. On a practical scale, schedules have been wiped and income reduced to zero. But psychologically, it also means that the planet\u2019s biggest extroverts have been robbed of an outlet. They have all this pent-up desire for approval, and nowhere to put it.\nUntil now, this has largely manifested itself in slightly cringey iPhone videos uploaded to the internet. But now Britney Spears, that bold pioneer, has opened up a whole new avenue of quarantined expression. That\u2019s right, she has become a film reviewer.\nThe first fruits of Britney\u2019s side-hustle appeared last night, as she posted her review of the Robert Downey Jr film Dolittle on Instagram. It reads:\nThis movie is a must see !!! @RobertDowneyJr is so genuine you fall in love with him \u2026 the animal characters are hilarious and there seems to be a Special Tone throughout the whole movie which I find hard to find these days \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude18. So if you watch this movie and you\u2019re as enamored as I was with his jackets and clothing \u2026 don\u2019t get lost like I did \ud83d\ude02 just remember he\u2019s a man who can speak to animals and he\u2019s brilliant \ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udc33\ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc3b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83d\udc95 !!!!! Pss \u2026 how long has it been since you\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ve wanted to see \u2026 I can\u2019t even count how many movies I\u2019ve watched in this quarantine so far \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 !!!!!\u201d\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\nNow, it\u2019s easy to mock Spears for this. The capitalisation of \u201cSpecial Tone\u201d. The term \u201cI find hard to find\u201d. The implication that the plot was slightly too complex for her. The fact that she is posting a critical rave for a film that not only contains a climactic scene where Robert Downey Jr frantically pulls a bagpipe from a dragon\u2019s bum, but is currently on schedule to be the biggest commercial flop of the year.\nAfter all, Britney\u2019s assessment of the film is quite the outlier. Compare her Dolittle rave with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw review, which called the film \u201chorribly inert\u201d. Or Empire, which deemed it \u201clacklustre\u201d. Or Total Film, which described it as \u201clifeless and dead-eyed\u201d. Or NPR, who decided it was less a film and more \u201ca crime scene in need of forensic analysis\u201d. Perhaps Britney was expecting less of Dolittle. Perhaps she uses a different set of criteria to evaluate cinema. Perhaps she watched the wrong film by accident. We may never know.\nHowever, take a look at Rotten Tomatoes and you\u2019ll find that her view is much more closely aligned to the public than the critics. The professionals gave Dolittle a miserable 15%. The general public, on the other hand, awarded it a mighty 76%. And Britney\u2019s post \u2013 essentially \u201cnice animals, good clothes, bit confusing in places\u201d \u2013 reads exactly like a 76% review. In layman\u2019s terms, this means that Spears has her finger on the pulse of public opinion. She understands what we want, and she always has, because she is one of us.\nAnd, don\u2019t forget, Dolittle is a flop. Far fewer people went to see it than anticipated, so there\u2019s a real chance that Spears\u2019 praise will inspire hundreds of thousands to seek it out. It might even dig the film out of the mire a little. For a successful actor such as Spears (no, really; her 2002 film Crossroads made its budget back five times over, making it a much hotter commercial property than Dolittle) to reach down and help an underdog like this shows a lot of class.\nNow we just have to sit back and wait to see what she reviews next. Will she continue to buck the critical trend, by slagging off Uncut Gems or embracing Playmobil: The Movie? Will she maintain her dedication to focusing on underperforming releases, by reviewing UglyDolls or The Goldfinch? How on earth will she use emojis to convey the Special Tone of Colour Out of Space or The Hunt? Either way, she has to review more films. Her public demands it.",

        "content": "Draft policy released by agriculture ministry cites concern over animal welfare and prevention of disease transmission as factors behind move\nThe Chinese government has signalled an end to the human consumption of dogs, with the agriculture ministry today releasing a draft policy that would forbid canine meat.\nCiting the \u201cprogress of human civilisation\u201d as well as growing public concern over animal welfare and prevention of disease transmission from animals to humans, China\u2019s Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs singled out canines as forbidden in a draft \u201cwhite list\u201d of animals allowed to be raised for meat.\nThe ministry called dogs a \u201cspecial companion animal\u201d and one not internationally recognised as livestock.\nThe city of Shenzhen recently approved the first ever mainland China ban on consumption of dog and cat meat, a move that has given hope to animal welfare groups worldwide that other parts of the country could soon follow suit. The new draft policy has provided even more.\n\u201cThe signal is the first ever from a ministry that dogs are not food animals,\u201d Paul Littlefair, international head of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told the Guardian. \u201c[This] leaves the door open for local governments to follow Shenzhen\u2019s lead.\u201d\nWhile not officially a ban on the consumption of dog meat, the draft policy from the agriculture ministry could be a \u201cgame changer moment for animal welfare in China\u201d, Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International (HSI) told the Guardian.\n\u201cThat signals a major shift, recognising that most people in China don\u2019t eat dogs and cats and want an end to the theft of their companion animals for a meat trade that only a small percentage of the population indulge in,\u201d Higgins said.\n HSI estimates that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at around 4 million per year.\nMost of these are stolen animals and not raised in captive breeding facilities, Higgins said.\n\u201cNot only does it cause enormous animal suffering, but it is also almost entirely fuelled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera,\u201d she said.\nThe updated agriculture ministry list includes the addition of several wildlife species allowed to be farmed under animal husbandry laws if the policy is not altered following a public comment period that runs through May 8.\nWildlife such as deer, game birds, along with mink, two kinds of foxes, and other animals were included on a list of animals expected to be approved as farm-raised species once China\u2019s central government lifts a ban on the wildlife trade.\nThe temporary wildlife trade ban was imposed from late January in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, largely thought to have originated in the formal or illicit wildlife supply chain.\nBut campaigners hope the government will go still further. Peter Li, China Policy Specialist with HSI, told the Guardian: \u201cListing wild animals, including foxes and raccoon dogs, as \u2018special livestock\u2019 is concerning. Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn\u2019t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments, their welfare needs simply can\u2019t be met. In addition, there\u2019s clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19, which is why we\u2019re urging China and all governments to stop trading in wildlife.\u201d",

        "content": "From Iain Stirling\u2019s Fifa banter to Jayde Adams live from her lounge, comedians isolated by the lockdown are reaching audiences online\nFor Scottish comedian and Love Island narrator Iain Stirling, nothing compares to live standup comedy. \u201cTelling the audience something that you find bizarre or idiosyncratic about your life and psyche, and having a roomful of people going: Ha ha ha! We\u2019re like that as well!\u201d He laughs at the relief it brings. \u201cYou go, thank God!\u201d\nThe coronavirus lockdown means it could be months until standups are able to hear the roar of laughter in comedy clubs again. Meanwhile, many are making the most of online platforms. Stirling, whose UK tour dates have been postponed, is live-streaming to his fans on Twitch, which principally involves chatting about gaming while he plays Fifa. Many of us are only just discovering networks such as Zoom and Houseparty during confinement, but Stirling was an early adopter and uses Twitch when working away from home on Love Island.\n\u201cYou know in the American local news there\u2019s those articles about the guy from Arizona who has built a zombie apocalypse bunker and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What have you built that for?\u2019\u201d When the worst happens, he says, everyone wants their own bunker. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about comedy and Twitch.\u201d\nSome have subscribed to his channel for so long that \u201cyou get to know people and what they\u2019re up to\u201d. He ends sessions with a raid, which sends his viewers to another live channel. \u201cI\u2019ll find someone with fewer than 10 viewers and a decent size webcam. Then I chuck 500-odd people into their chat. Sometimes they\u2019re playing League of Legends with their mates and resent it.\u201d He laughs. \u201cGenerally, it\u2019s good.\u201d\nIt may not be the same as performing to a sold-out comedy crowd but Twitch \u201cscratches the itch\u201d when Stirling is missing standup. His partner, the presenter Laura Whitmore, \u201chas noticed I\u2019ve stopped doing material at her in the kitchen, which is good\u201d.\nFor some, online comedy offers escapism during confinement. Alexis Strum\u2019s new podcast, The Funny Women Survival Guide, is specifically designed to uplift. Strum introduces herself as a writer and performer, then adds newly discovered roles as home-schooler and hairdresser that will be relatable for many. With subjects in the first episode including being upstaged by your pet on conference calls, she describes her podcast as an attempt \u201cto cheer up the nation\u201d.\nTaskmaster\u2019s Alex Horne is challenging the nation with Home Tasking, a series of eccentric assignments \u2013 \u201cThrow a piece of paper into a bin spectacularly\u201d, \u201cMake the best dancing elephant\u201d \u2013 to keep families entertained. Participants share videos of their attempts and a modest prize is promised. (\u201cSomething nice,\u201d says Horne. \u201cNot a car.\u201d)\nStandup Philip Simon had gigs and a TV commercial cancelled because of the crisis, so to give himself \u2013 and others with kids \u2013 \u201ca little focus\u201d, he established School\u2019s Out Comedy Club. Simon invites children to submit jokes, which he says develops their creative writing skills, and he performs them to camera. Some children submit videos of themselves telling gags. The next episode is dedicated to the NHS so \u201cdoctor, doctor\u201d jokes are welcome.\nMe giving daily corona virus updates to my household pic.twitter.com/mqayn8wt53\nStandup Kae Kurd has a nice line in funny videos about stressed dads cutting their kids\u2019 hair and helping with homework. Kurd doesn\u2019t have children \u2013 he is in isolation with his brothers \u2013 but he has a lot of friends with kids and knows what they are going through. \u201cIt\u2019s funny seeing how parents are dealing with this. At first they\u2019re like, \u2018The structure is really important.\u2019 After a week, it\u2019s like, \u2018Can you just stay in your room and not accidentally stab yourself?\u2019\u201d\nKurd has been prolific at sharing homemade funnies but says standups in the UK haven\u2019t tended to focus on making material specially for online. \u201cWe\u2019re similar to New York comics in the sense that we can make a living off gigs. But if you look at comics from LA, they have to work on web series and podcasts, too.\u201d He is sharing videos on social media to build his audience, but it\u2019s also a coping mechanism. Plus, he doesn\u2019t want to be doing material about the lockdown when it\u2019s over and he goes on tour. \u201cI might as well get these ideas out while I can when we\u2019re all going through it. The last thing people will want to hear afterwards is, \u201cRemember corona?\u2019 I can already imagine the jokes: \u2018I was self-isolating, which is like The Hunger Games but with my cat \u2026\u2019 Get away from me, man. I don\u2019t want to hear any of that crap.\u201d\nCreating viral comedy is \u201ca distinctly different skill\u201d to standup, he says. If he has a good idea, \u201cI just try it and see how people receive it. You will know from the views and engagement levels what works better.\u201d It\u2019s an accelerated process of preparing new material to try at a gig \u2013 you can film instantly at home and get an immediate response online.\nViewers are visiting many comedians\u2019 homes during the lockdown. Jayde Adams is hosting a weekly half-hour \u201ccouch cabaret\u201d on Facebook Live from her living room (a treasure trove of fabulousness with a plush blue sofa). Her first show included singing sisters Flo & Joan harmonising through isolation, Rose Matafeo doing a Phantom of the Opera number with a pair of glove puppets, and Steve Bugeja\u2019s predictions for life after lockdown. (\u201cDogs will get excited when we leave for work, not when we get home.\u201d) Adams featured in a sketch imagining the unfortunate effects of Joe Wicks\u2019s stomping exercises for his neighbours. The show was watched by audiences around the world, from Adams\u2019 home town of Bristol to the US, where her Amazon Prime show, Serious Black Jumper, is a hit and led to a surge of interest on TikTok.\nAdams says she\u2019s fortunate because, unlike a lot of comedians on the circuit, she has television and radio work, too, and doesn\u2019t rely purely on live shows. She acknowledges that standup online can be very difficult to pull off without an audience in the room because you usually \u201cride their laughter like a surfer\u201d.\nHer cabaret gives a platform to comedians, musicians and dancers who may not otherwise have the technical knowhow to share work and successfully find audiences online. She decided to put together a variety bill for locked-in audiences because that\u2019s the entertainment she remembers watching at home with her family as a child \u2013 though you\u2019d imagine that those TV cabaret shows didn\u2019t feature, as hers does, a man named Pudding wearing a gimp suit. Pudding is Adams\u2019 boyfriend, comedian Rich Wilson. They are sharing their home with another comedian, Paul Sweeney, and film and edit the show themselves. The trio also have an online pub quiz and gin club.\nKiri Pritchard-McLean is compering Saturday night gigs on Zoom, with proceeds being split between performers and charity. The lineups combine established names and \u201cgems from the circuit\u201d, with tickets being sold for \u00a32 or \u00a310 if you want a \u201cfront row\u201d ticket, which allows you to share your screen and chat to her. She points out that it is a comedy bill curated by a comedian rather than a producer, so her bills will reflect a wider pool of talent from the comedy circuit than a TV producer\u2019s might.\nEven BBC regulars such as Have I Got News for You and The Mash Report are bringing together hosts and guests from their lounges and spare rooms. Aspiring comedy producer Andy Ash has been quick to develop his own format, which he describes as \u201ca social distancing panel show with isolated comedians\u201d. WhatsApp\u2019ening is hosted by Mark O\u2019Sullivan from Lee and Dean, and its panelists must separate fact from fiction. The game is played via a WhatsApp group chat and the loser forfeits control of their WhatsApp so the winner can send messages to whoever they like. Episode one featured Stevie Martin (sporting a stylish eyepatch due to an infection), Jacob Hawley, Nic Sampson and Lauren Pattison, who is in lockdown at her childhood home.\nSome of Ash\u2019s guests had Edinburgh fringe shows lined up and he recognises that the festival\u2019s cancellation is an \u201cimmeasurable blow\u201d for many comedians. He fears the climate threatens artistic aspirations \u201cparticularly if you come from a poorer background\u201d. He says that, as well as donating to funds for freelance creatives, it can also be productive to \u201cinvest in something creative and funny\u201d. Ash became involved in comedy production as a way of dealing with grief after his mother died in 2016. \u201cI decided I wanted to be a part of making people happy, bringing laughter to them,\u201d he says. During lockdown, \u201cnow more than ever we need something to laugh at, to be joyous about\u201d.\nThe nimble world of online comedy content, which can be swiftly created, widely shared and is vital as clubs remain closed, could introduce a new wave of comedians to audiences. Ash points to the boom in bedroom music production in the 90s and how it created a revolution. \u201cMaybe this could be a moment for comedy, too. I certainly hope so.\u201d",

In fact, one might say most of Europe does, with Portugal currently in a state of emergency due to the you-know-what. \u201cHouse arrest?! Please, the judiciary system of Portugal! No more!\u201d Pinto might have feigned as he was lead by guards \u2013 presumably not standing at a distance of two metres \u2013 away to the nearest Lisbon digs.\nThere are a couple of catches. Pinto does potentially face 30 years in jail if found guilty of 90 charges, having been extradited from Hungary in March 2019 for allegedly attempting to blackmail an investment fund. And Pinto\u2019s lawyers confirmed that the 31-year-old, whose website played a crucial part in providing evidence which led to Manchester City\u2019s Champions League ban, as well as numerous investigations into tax evasion and corruption in football, is \u201cbanned from using the internet.\u201d\nThat leaves poor Pinto condemned to read things like Big Papers and the back of cereal packets during his house arrest. But maybe there is some light at the end of the plushly-carpeted corridor. \u201cRui Pinto\u2019s defence welcomes this decision and trusts that further steps will be taken for the freedom of our client,\u201d parped his lawyers.

As a fellow West Ham fan, on a cold, wet and windy Wednesday night in December 1996, through torrential rain and horrendous traffic I eagerly drove up the M6 from Birmingham to watch Stockport v West Ham in a Milk Cup fourth-round replay. The Hammers took the lead through our talisman, Julian Dicks, and just a minute later our star striker, Iain Dowie, rose majestically to plant a powerful header into the corner of the net. Unfortunately it was our net, but a great finish nonetheless. West Ham imploded and Brett Angell fired in what was to prove to be Stockport\u2019s winner just a couple of minutes later.

The journey was otherwise trouble-free, until we got to within half a mile of Euston, where the train stopped and didn\u2019t move again for about two hours.

Pressures are being exacerbated by staff absences due to healthcare workers having contracted the virus or self-isolating because of a suspicion they may have it.\nThe respiratory assistants at Torbay and South Devon will be unpaid, according to the Health Service Journal, which first reported their recruitment. The Guardian understands they were undergoing training via Zoom on Thursday. They will not be making decisions about triage, intubation or withdrawal of medical treatment, the trust confirmed.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe have received many offers of voluntary help from veterinary staff who have valuable skills that can be used to support frontline staff who are dealing with respiratory problems.\u201d\nA job advert for bedside support workers at Hampshire trust, whose recruitment drive was first reported by Vet Times, says that successful applicants will be paid between \u00a317,000 and \u00a342,000, with vets, veterinary surgeons and dentists in a higher salary band than veterinary or dental nurses.\nA spokesperson for the trust said: \u201cFollowing a number of offers of help from skilled professionals working outside the NHS, such as vets and dentists, we have developed a bespoke role called a bedside support worker.\n\u201cThis is a role we have created in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which will support our brilliant staff in critical care and on medical wards, who are all working tirelessly to respond to this unprecedented challenge.\n\u201cPatient care remains our top priority, and only those who are assessed to have the appropriate transferable skills, education and training will temporarily join our team.\u201d\nVets have been contributing to the crisis effort in other ways. On Thursday, Willow Farm vets, a team that works across northern England, said it had donated 4,000 protective gowns, amid concerns about a shortage of personal protective equipment for hospital staff. It followed VetPartners, based in York, which said on Monday that it was donating masks, aprons, gloves and ventilators to the health service.\nDr Rachel Dean, director of clinical research and excellence in practice at VetPartners, said some ventilators used on animals were the same as those used on humans, particularly on children.\nThe Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons issued advice to its members on Wednesday about how they could best help during the Covid-19 pandemic, recommending that they consider assisting the livestock production, meat hygiene and food import/export industries before volunteering with the NHS.\nThe college\u2019s registrar, Eleanor Ferguson, said: \u201cIf local NHS trusts do choose to employ veterinary professionals to undertake roles that are not reserved by law to licensed doctors, nurses or other regulated professionals, they must be satisfied that the individual has the skills and competencies to do that role.\n\u201cHowever, any veterinary professionals employed in these roles should not misrepresent their position to patients and must be careful not to hold themselves out as a licensed medical doctor or nurse.\u201d",

The people who didn\u2019t bother turning up to work, you know, they will be the first people that we have to get rid of, unfortunately.\u201d\nWhile he repeatedly told workers to stay at home if they were unwell or displaying symptoms, Madden also said: \u201cIf we look at the 45% of people who are off sick [at the moment], maybe 5% of those have coronavirus. The other 40% of people just don\u2019t want to come.\u201d\nThe same messages were then repeated in Hindi for the benefit of workers who did not speak English. Bakkavor has since apologised and said that Madden is now on \u201cleave\u201d.\nThe company warned its investors last week that Covid-19 had \u201ccreated significant operational challenges\u201d for the group and that the pandemic \u201chas resulted in a reduction in orders across all of our categories [meals, salads, desserts, pizza and bread]\u201d.\nIt is also facing the task of improving its Covid-19 safety measures in all its 25 plants, with Madden admitting to Elveden workers in the video that \u201cwe can\u2019t social distance in [the factory]\u201d and urging them to use a multi-tube \u2013 a type of stretch fabric scarf worn around the neck during outdoor sports that can be pulled over the wearer\u2019s mouth and nose. Products made at Elveden include Tesco chips, Tesco lamb kofta, M&S \u201cdirty\u201d fries and a range of sauces.\nSome workers have told the Guardian and ITV News that they have felt under pressure to attend work at the Elveden site.\nA Bakkavor spokesman said: \u201cWe take this very seriously and are investigating the matter. We apologise to our Elveden staff for any miscommunication or worry caused. The manager in question has been given leave and prior to his return to work, he will undertake further training around his role and responsibilities and the high standards we expect of a Bakkavor manager.\n\u201cOur advice to all our staff is to stay at home if they are feeling unwell or believe they have symptoms or if they are self-isolating due to members of their household displaying symptoms \u2013 points that were communicated at the staff briefing you have footage from.\n\u201cWe are saddened and concerned to hear today that a few colleagues feel under pressure to come to work and we\u2019re putting protocols in place to speak to all staff at their next shift to make it absolutely clear that no colleague should come to work if they feel unwell, are self-isolating or if a family member is unwell.\u201d\nAndre Marques, a London organiser at the GMB union, which has members on the Elveden site, said: \u201cThis behaviour is absolutely shocking. It is beyond unacceptable to threaten workers with the sack just for trying to keep themselves and their families safe.\n\u201c[We are] calling for urgent action to protect the safety of workers at Bakkavor, including the immediate introduction of social distancing and proper protective equipment. A snood [multi-tube] is not proper protective equipment for a workplace.\u201d\nBakkavor said that multi-tubes were just one measure in a range of \u201cfurther controls\u201d to make its sites safer, including the introduction of visors. It said it previously had in place \u201cwide-ranging safety measures\u201d and had not made, or had plans to make, any redundancies.",

It will most likely be between Sunday and the start of the Carlsen Invitational on 18 April.\nThis pairing will hark back to the controversial Carlsen v Firouzja game in the World Blitz in Moscow in December. Firouzja is compared to the tactical legend Mikhail Tal, while Carlsen is perceived as the successor to Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov.\nThere has already been a recent astonishing low profile marathon series between the two, played on 2 April on Lichess and consisting of 194 one-minute bullet games, many of which have been captured in online videos.\nThe match was first to 100 wins. Counting the draws, Firouzja triumphed 103.5-90.5. Some blamed Carlsen\u2019s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja moved faster by finger touch. Others claimed that Carlsen had tired himself by playing 70 bullet games against fellow Norwegians immediately beforehand. The play was often of remarkably high quality on both sides for all moves in one minute with no increment, like this example analysed by GM Daniel King on Chessbase.\nThe Banter Blitz dream final promises to be exceptionally watchable since both players have been in devastating form in earlier rounds. Up to the semi-final, Firouzja had won all five of his best of 16 game matches by at least six points, while Carlsen produced a Fischer-style performance in his semi-final. The world champion defeated Sanan Sjugirov, a Russian who had beaten him twice over the board, by a perfect 9-0, playing some wonderful games en route, all of which can be watched on video with Carlsen\u2019s commentary.\nFirouzja had a much harder fight in Friday evening\u2019s second semi-final, but still defeated India\u2019s 26-year-old GM Srinath Narayanan, who had eliminated his five previous opponents, by a 9-6 margin, checkmating his opponent in the final game.\nOther major internet events have already begun or will soon be under way as experts and amateurs seize the opportunity for the serious competition which abruptly stopped over the board in mid-March due to Covid-19.\nBritain\u2019s national league, the 4NCL, was quickly into action as an online 4NCL attracted 172 four-player teams, far above expectations. The opening weekly round (of 10) was played on Tuesday on lichess.org, the user-friendly free site where you are paired with an opponent within a few seconds and which is recommended for newcomers to internet chess.\nOne unusual aspect of the online 4NCL is that Guildford,who have dominated the over-the-board version for the best part of a decade, are absent. In place of their elite GM squad there is a team of rising talents, Guildford Young Guns. There is also Guildford Gatekeepers, a quartet of low-rated amateurs.\nChessPlus Alpha, a new 4NCL name, and Ireland\u2019s Gonzaga, whose base is a Dublin college, are the two top seeds. ChessPlus Alpha have registered some well-known Swedish GMs, though they did not field any of them in defeating Watford 3-1. Gonzaga suffered a shock defeat, 1.5-2.5 to Surbiton, for whom Koby Kalavannan, aged 17, enhanced his growing reputation by scoring the individual upset of the night, beating France\u2019s GM S\u00e9bastien Maz\u00e9.\nWednesday 15 April sees the chess.com $10,000 Abu Dhabi Blitz, whose entry is headed by the US world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, and France\u2019s world No 5, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, leader of last month\u2019s aborted Candidates. This event is open to all titled players.\nThe online tournament boom hosted by popular websites has left the official global body Fide looking a touch flat footed,and without a challenger to Carlsen following the suspension of the Candidates last month at the halfway point. Fide does have a web presence, its online Arena where you can qualify for international titles up to AGM, but it still lacks the appeal of the leading commercial websites.\n3666 1...Rxe5! If now 2 Nxe5 Qg5! with the winning double threat Qxg2 mate and Nxh3+followed by Qxd2 winning the queen.

        "content": "Notes to global health leaders on 10 and 11 January highlighted possible infection routes\nThe World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection.\nTechnical guidance notes seen by the Guardian and briefings by top WHO officials warned of potential human-to-human transmission and made clear that there was a threat of catching the disease through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, based on the experience of earlier coronavirus outbreaks, such as Sars and Mers.\nIn recent days, Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a tweet from the group on 14 January saying there was no human-to-human transmission.\n\u201cIn many ways, they were wrong. They also minimised the threat very strongly,\u201d the US president said, before threatening to cut funding to the organisation.\nTrump supporters have been calling for the resignation of the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and for a congressional investigation of the body\u2019s performance.\nThe January WHO tweet reported \u201cpreliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d.\nBut in the same week top WHO officials were briefing health leaders around the world to keep looking out for signs of such transmission, and to take precautions as if it was already happening.\nThe WHO declared a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d on 30 January, a day before Trump banned non-American residents who had been to China from entering the US. Nearly a month after the WHO declaration, Trump tweeted: \u201cThe coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d, adding that the WHO had \u201cbeen working hard and very smart\u201d.\nTrump has pointed out that US funding of the WHO was more than 10 times China\u2019s contribution, citing figures of $450m (\u00a3360m) and $42m, a reference to annual combined assessed contributions (membership fees) and donations. However, the US is currently about $200m in arrears in its assessed contributions, and donations are tied to specific projects.\nSince the WHO launched a coronavirus emergency appeal, China has donated just over $20m, about the same as the UK, and the US has given less than $15m. Japan has donated $47.5m, Kuwait $40m and the European commission $33m.\nTedros has urged governments not to politicise the pandemic, warning on Wednesday: \u201cWe will have many body bags in front of us if we don\u2019t behave.\u201d\nThe WHO director general said: \u201cThe United States and China should come together and fight this dangerous enemy \u2026 It\u2019s like playing with fire. When there are cracks at national level and global level that\u2019s when the virus succeeds. For God\u2019s sake, we have lost more than 60,000 citizens of the world.\u201d\nThe technical guidance notes published by the WHO on the 10 and 11 of January were issued when suspected infections in China comprised a few dozen cases.\nThe notes lay out detailed clinical criteria for dealing with suspected cases as well as warning of the risk of ease of transmission both by airborne droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces, suggesting isolation procedures.\nAs well as being posted online, the guidance was sent to the organisation\u2019s regional emergency directors and country heads to be circulated to senior health officials.\nOne note, published on 11 January, advised clinicians and health officials to be alert to the emergence of clusters of cases as well as any \u201cevidence of amplified or sustained human-to-human transmission\u201d despite the Chinese, at that stage, not reporting sustained local transmission.\nWhile the document advised medical personnel to look out for suspected patients who might have travelled to China\u2019s Hubei province, or health workers who had contact with the then new virus, it also recommended that doctors look out for \u201cunusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment\u201d regardless of those factors.\nIt added caution even if another clinical explanation had been advanced that appeared to \u201cfully explain\u201d the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nA day earlier, another guidance note on collecting samples from patients showing symptoms of the disease listed stringent precautions to avoid the risk of human-to-human transmission, using the experience from the Mers coronavirus.\nThe documents add to a body of emerging evidence of the widespread early warnings about the coronavirus, many communicated by \u2013 and to \u2013 senior US officials, which were ignored by Trump.\nIn a briefing at WHO headquarters on 14 January, the same day as the tweet about the Chinese results, the organisation\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, told reporters that while there had so far been only limited human transmission between family members in China, the risk of wider human-to-human transmission should not be regarded as \u201csurprising\u201d given the similarity to earlier Sars and Mers outbreaks.\nAn investigation in the Washington Post last week discovered a warning from US officials at the beginning of January relating to the threat of coronavirus.\nOn 3 January Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), spoke with his Chinese counterpart, George Gao, and was alerted to the newly emerging disease, becoming concerned enough for the CDC to establish an incident management structure for the new coronavirus on 7 January and activating its emergency response structure two weeks later, on 21 January.\nDespite that move by the CDC, a day later Trump was insisting the situation was under control. \u201cIt\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: researchers found some areas outside the bounds of the Great Barrier Reef had 90% of their shallow water corals bleached this summer\nMore than half of the spectacular and remote coral reefs beyond the boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer, an underwater scientific expedition has found.\nSeveral reefs in the vast Coral Sea marine park known among divers for their arrays of corals, large fish and precipitous drop offs into the deep ocean suffered extreme bleaching.\nScientists from James Cook University\u2019s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies recorded the bleaching on the reefs that are more than 200km offshore during dives in February and March.\nSome reefs had 90% of their shallow water corals bleached \u2013 an extreme level likely to lead to deaths of many corals, said Prof Andrew Hoey, a co-ordinator of the expedition.\nHoey said: \u201cIt\u2019s becoming too familiar to jump in to the water and see large swatches of severely bleached corals. It\u2019s quite devastating.\u201d\nEven at 10 metres deep, some reefs saw half their corals bleached, with isolated bleaching seen as deep as 20 metres.\nHoey, a marine biologist at James Cook University, said the results were preliminary with further analysis to be carried out for the three-year monitoring project, which comes to a close in June.\nThe project is the most extensive reef survey of the Coral Sea Marine Park ever undertaken and is funded by the federal government agency Parks Australia.\nHoey said in 2020 they had visited \u201cthe majority of the reef complexes\u201d across the marine park that covers almost 1m sq km. A small number of reefs in the far north and far east were not visited this year.\nMore than half of the reefs visited had been severely bleached, including dive tourism spots like Osprey Reef north of Port Douglas, Bougainville Reef off Cooktown and Flinders Reef off Townsville.\nThe Coral Sea reefs are less well known than their neighbours to the west on the Great Barrier Reef, which experienced a third mass bleaching outbreak in five years this summer.\nThe Coral Sea reefs were surveyed between mid-February and mid-March. Hoey said water temperatures were above 30C. Usual temperatures were 27C and 28C.\nCorals bleach when they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Corals can recover if bleaching is only mild but if temperatures are very high for prolonged periods, corals can die.\nOn 18 March, the US government\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program produced analysis of heat stress over the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea showing \u201csignificant amounts of heat stress\u201d.\nTownsville-based Dr William Skirving, of Coral Reef Watch, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAll the Australia reefs outside of the GBR will have had significant amounts of bleaching and many would have had significant amounts of mortality.\u201d\nHoey said unlike reefs closer to shore in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the reefs in the Coral Sea were largely unaffected by pollution and fishing pressures.\n\u201cBut they are extremely susceptible to climate-induced stresses,\u201d he said.\nHoey said it was \u201chard to predict\u201d how many corals would die.\nThese more remote reefs, he said, relied on their own corals to spawn and regrow, unlike the more tightly packed reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.\nHe said: \u201cAny coral mortality will take a lot longer to recover from because there is hundreds of kilometres between these reefs and so there\u2019s unlikely to be a lot of connectivity between them.\u201d\n\u201cBecause of their isolation we have a lot to learn about these reefs, but we would still expect any fish and other organisms relying on the reefs to have been affected, particularly those relying on the corals for food and shelter.\u201d\nRichard Leck, WWF-Australia\u2019s head of oceans, said it was concerning that Coral Sea reefs had bleached because they were regarded as more resilient, as they benefitted from cool water upwelling and very clear water.\nHe said: \u201cThe fact they have bleached shows how extreme the underwater heatwave was in the Coral Sea. It shows how close we are to a tipping point with climate change and coral reefs.\n\u201cThe reefs in the Coral Sea are less well known, except amongst the high-end scuba diving community. They\u2019re a jewel in the crown for many divers around the world to come and visit.\u201d\nCraig Stephen, managing director of Mike Ball Dive Expeditions, has been visiting the Coral Sea reefs since 1995.\nHe said there were still many amazing places to visit on the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea and \u201cgiven time\u201d he said he thought the reefs would recover.\n\u201cThese [Coral Sea] reefs rise from the sheer depths in very clear water,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge soft corals and sea fans dominate the depths and sharks abound, giving the diver a real sense of being in the abyss.\n\u201cYou can hang off a wall that\u2019s 1,000 metres and there you feel pretty insignificant. People enjoy the vastness of it.\u201d\nThe 2020 bleaching was a \u201creset point for many of us\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe do need to step back and have a look at what we are doing to the planet.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t take a good look at ourselves and do something about our CO2 emissions then things will get out of our control. There is a chance to do something about this.\u201d",

        "content": "Top US official says \u2018there is absolutely no evidence\u2019 of claims of coronavirus overcount pushed by rightwing media\nAnthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, has warned that baseless \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are swirling around the coronavirus crisis following claims that America\u2019s official death toll from Covid-19 has been overstated.\nFauci, who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said he had seen unfounded conjecture attach itself to previous crises and dismissed the emerging idea, largely promoted by high-profile figures in rightwing media, that the US\u2019s Covid-19 death toll is being inflated by unrelated medical conditions.\n\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that that\u2019s the case at all,\u201d Fauci told NBC on Thursday. \u201cI think it falls under the category of something that\u2019s very unfortunate \u2013 these conspiracy theories that we hear about. Any time we have a crisis of any sort there is always this popping up of conspiracy theories.\u201d\nAccording to the official Centers for Disease Control (CDC) count, by the end of Wednesday there had been 12,754 deaths in the US due to the Covid-19 virus, from a total of 395,011 people who have been confirmed as infected.\nThe number of deaths has more than doubled over the past week, with New York continuing to be at the heart of the crisis after experiencing more infections than the whole of Spain, along with 4,000 deaths. On Tuesday, 779 people died from the coronavirus in New York state, a one-day record. New Jersey also set a one-day record, with 275 deaths, while Louisiana announced 70 further deaths on that day, matching its worst daily toll.\nPublic health experts have criticized a severe lack of planning by the Trump administration for the US becoming the global coronavirus hotspot, with a dearth of testing and equipment leading to hospitals being overwhelmed in places and states desperately scrambling to source ventilators, masks and gowns.\nBut several media figures who are sympathetic to the president have started to question the official death toll, claiming it is being distorted for political purposes, by including in the statistics people dying of other causes.\nFox News\u2019s Brit Hume, who has previously tweeted that New York\u2019s \u201cfatality numbers are inflated\u201d, appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s late-night show on Tuesday to claim that any person with the virus is being counted as a Covid-19 death \u201cregardless of what else may be wrong\u201d. Carlson responded by saying, \u201cThere may be reasons people seek an inaccurate death count,\u201d adding: \u201cWhen journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u201d\nThe rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh, who received the presidential medal of freedom from Trump, previously dismissed Covid-19 as similar to the \u201ccommon cold\u201d but changed tack recently to claim: \u201cIt\u2019s admittedly speculation, but \u2026 what if we are recording a bunch of deaths to coronavirus which really should not be chalked up to coronavirus?\u201d\nTrump regularly echoes theories espoused on Fox News and previously dismissed an official death toll of 3,000 people in Puerto Rico in the wake of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria. However, the president has yet to follow suit by questioning the Covid-19 figures, telling reporters that he thinks the states have been \u201cpretty accurate on the death count\u201d.\nAccording to Deborah Birx, the response coordinator on the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, a person who goes into hospital to be treated for Covid-19 and has a pre-existing condition that eventually causes them to die, this is counted as a Covid-19 death. This is slightly different from Hume\u2019s claim that someone dying for whatever reason is counted in the toll if they also have the coronavirus.\nAccording to the CDC, about 90% of people recently hospitalized with the coronavirus had at least one underlying medical condition. Black people and older people are disproportionately being hospitalized because of the virus, due to their increased rate of other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or respiratory problems.\nIt is in fact more likely that the coronavirus death toll is much higher than the official figures suggest, rather than it being inflated. The CDC has acknowledged its count is an \u201cunderestimation\u201d because it only tallies cases where Covid-19 has been confirmed in a laboratory test.\nEpidemiologists say a widespread lack of initial testing in the US means many people died without being counted, while even now some people who die at home or in nursing homes are not being tested for the virus.\nIn New York City, more than 200 people are dying at home each day during the pandemic, according to city officials, a very much higher rate than usual. Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s mayor, has estimated that about 100 to 200 people a day who die at home in the city are not being included in the official virus death count. But the federal government insists the overall figures are largely accurate.\n\u201cI think there is more of a chance of missing some that are really coronavirus deaths that are not being counted,\u201d Fauci told NBC. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that number is significant enough to really substantially modify the trends that we are seeing, at all.\u201d",

        "content": "Frank Gabrin, a New York physician, knew the stakes of his job \u2013 but circumstances around the pandemic unsettled him as he donned used protective gear\nAt around 5am on 19 March, a New York ER physician named Frank Gabrin texted a friend about his concerns over the lack of medical supplies at hospitals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s busy \u2013 everyone wants a Covid test that I do not have to give them,\u201d he wrote in the message to Eddy Soffer. \u201cSo they are angry and disappointed.\u201d\nWorse, though, was the limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 the masks and gloves that both prevent healthcare workers getting sick and spreading the virus to others. Gabrin said he had no choice but to don the same mask for several shifts, against Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines.\n\u201cDon\u2019t have any PPE that has not been used,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo N95 masks \u2013 my own goggles \u2013 my own face shield,\u201d he added, referring to the N95 respirators that are considered one of the best lines of defense.\nLess than two weeks later, Gabrin became the first ER doctor in the US known to have died as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians.\nHe is one of numerous medical workers across the US who have succumbed to the virus, from doctors and nurses to paramedics and hospital food service employees. The Guardian and Kaiser Health News are launching a new project, Lost on the Frontline, to track them and tell their stories.\nNew York City-area hospitals have been particularly hard-hit. More than one-third of all US cases have occurred in New York state. At a hospital in the borough of Queens, patients have reportedly died while waiting for a bed, and a temporary trailer morgue was set up outside. Physicians at another hospital system created a GoFundMe appeal because they had insufficient masks and gowns.\nGabrin knew the stakes of his job. \u201cInside the emergency, the angel of death is in the room,\u201d he wrote in his 2013 book Back from Burnout. \u201cThe pressure is intense, yet there is a calm, a peace, like being in the eye of the storm.\u201d\nHis own resilience was hard-won after several close brushes with mortality, and his marriage to a special man only seven months before the Covid-19 spike in New York. But circumstances around the coronavirus unsettled him. \u201cI have to admit,\u201d he posted on Facebook, \u201cI am having some anxiety.\u201d\nToothy and energetic, Gabrin, 60 was adored by colleagues at hospitals in Ohio, New York and elsewhere. He was loud. He always arrived at work bearing food to share. He was \u201ca ray of sunshine\u201d, said physician assistant Lois-Ann Welsh, and possessed the \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d that differentiated a great doctor from merely a good one.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hold any fancy titles and I am not the director of anything,\u201d Gabrin explained in his book. \u201cBut I can say that I have spent the last quarter of a century at the bedside of America\u2019s sick, injured, intoxicated, impaired and disenfranchised.\u201d\nBorn in Pennsylvania, Gabrin was a physician by calling, and his mother had photographs of him as a child tending to neighborhood dogs. His commitment to his profession was strengthened by his own illness. During his first year as an attending physician, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He survived, but it returned when he was 38. Both testicles were eventually removed \u2013 he called it \u201cthe mutilating surgery\u201d. Even so, he resolved to offer others the second chance that he himself received twice.\nThis, and an incident when a man tried to kill Gabrin at his ER, choking him so that he \u201cstarted turning purple in the face\u201d, helped lead to Gabrin\u2019s unique professional philosophy. He described it in his book, where he explained how medics can overcome burnout and feel greater compassion for their patients.\nA huge shift in his life came a few years ago, when at a nightclub he met Arnold Vargas, a Peruvian who had lived in the US for a decade.\n\u201cI saw [Gabrin] the happiest with \u00c1ngel,\u201d said Soffer, using Vargas\u2019s middle name, as Gabrin did. \u201cAll his fear dissipated and he became his true self.\u201d\n\u201cI think it gave me a second chance,\u201d said Vargas, now 28. \u201cHe showed me the light \u2013 how beautiful my life can be.\u201d He had been miserable, in a rut, yet Gabrin pushed him to train in massage therapy and to apply for US citizenship. There was an age difference, but to Vargas, who felt enriched by Gabrin and his experiences, it was irrelevant. \u201cI was always thinking, \u2018I just want to make you happy,\u2019 and he did the same for me.\u201d\nThey married in August 2019 at city hall in New York.\nWhen infections in New York surged in March, Gabrin posted a picture of ambulances crowding a hospital bay on Facebook. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Oh my God, this is the moment Armageddon happens,\u2019\u201d said Debra Vasalech Lyons, another old friend. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, it\u2019s still manageable, but it\u2019s not going to be this way forever.\u2019\u201d\nIn fact, St John\u2019s Episcopal in Queens, one of two hospitals where Gabrin worked at the time, was among local facilities \u201cdealing with challenges around PPE\u201d, said the New York city council member Donovan Richards. The hospital says it has always had enough equipment for staff.\nRichards linked difficult conditions there to historic discrimination and underresourcing in the largely African American and Hispanic district. \u201cWhen America gets a cold, black and brown communities get pneumonia,\u201d Richards said. \u201cBut in this instance, we are getting death sentences.\u201d\nThe other hospital at which Gabrin was employed, East Orange General in New Jersey, served a majority African American community, and also had a devoted staff that before the virus had struggled to maintain care standards.\nIn conversations with his husband and friends in mid- and late March, including in text messages shared with the Guardian, Gabrin said he had to reuse his PPE because he did not receive replacements. He told Lyons that he was attempting to wash an N95 mask to make it last several shifts, and that the only gloves available were too small for his hands and ripped.\nLyons mailed him gloves in the correct size from Florida, where she lives, and ordered four gallons of hand sanitizer for him. On Facebook, Gabrin wrote about concocting his own sanitizer from vodka and aloe vera plants.\nThe heads of the two emergency rooms where Gabrin worked both said they had sufficient supplies of protective equipment.\n\u201cI know for one thing he wasn\u2019t speaking about a lack of PPE at St John\u2019s,\u201d said Dr Teddy Lee, the ER chairman there.\n\u201cIf for a second I thought that was our problem at East Orange I would tell you otherwise,\u201d said the ER chairman, Dr Alvaro Alban.\nOn 25 March, when Gabrin arrived home, \u201che said, \u2018Baby, something bad happened tonight,\u2019\u201d Vargas recalled. A coronavirus patient with whom Gabrin formed a deep connection had passed away. Gabrin took a shower and cried, then he and Vargas offered a prayer for the person\u2019s soul.\nThe next morning, a Thursday, they both had symptoms, and self-quarantined. \u201cIt was me using the same mask for four days in a row that infected me,\u201d he texted Lyons. Through the weekend their cases seemed mild. Gabrin coughed and had joint aches, but didn\u2019t have significant respiratory issues. On Monday, though, Gabrin was in greater pain and spent the day in bed.\nAt about 10am on Tuesday, he woke Vargas and said, \u201cBaby, I can\u2019t breathe, help me.\u201d\nHe was gasping for air in great, hoarse breaths, but could not get enough oxygen. Vargas called Lyons and 911. But by the time paramedics arrived, Gabrin was on the edge of death, or had already gone. His face had turned purple.\nFrank \u201cpassed away in my arms\u201d, Vargas said. \u201cHe was looking into my eyes.\u201d\nVargas himself eventually recovered. On Tuesday, two weeks after Gabrin\u2019s death, the doctor will be buried at Maple Grove Cemetery in Queens.\nOwing to the need for physical distancing, Vargas was told, only 10 mourners will be allowed.\nThe headstone, Vargas expects, will bear a middle name that Gabrin adopted thanks to his decades-old interest in Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition. That name, Pinchas, now seems poignant.\nIt comes from a biblical figure who halted a plague.\nThe Guardian and Kaiser Health News are collecting the stories of medical workers killed by the pandemic.

        "content": "Industries like manufacturing could return to normal before entertainment companies, according to Whitehall sources\nMinisters are looking at ending the coronavirus lockdown with a \u201cgradual sector-by-sector approach\u201d that could see vital industries such as manufacturing get back to work before less critical ones like entertainment, according to Whitehall sources.\nTwo officials said one of the main options being explored for ending the lockdown was the idea of a phased return by industry, with civil servants in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy among those looking at how it could work.\nWith UK-wide deaths at almost 900 a day, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, confirmed on Thursday that measures to stem the spread of the disease would remain in place until there is evidence that the number of fatalities has reached its peak.\nRaab \u2013 who is deputising for the prime minister while he remains in hospital with Covid-19 \u2013 told the daily Downing Street press conference that it was too early to lift the restrictions on people\u2019s daily lives, without saying how long they would last for. \u201cWe are not done yet. We must keep going,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost three weeks and we\u2019re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we\u2019ve all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven\u2019t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it\u2019s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place. We must stick to the plan and we must continue to be guided by the science.\u201d\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/08-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid19lockdown.mp3\nDowning Street has repeatedly refused to set out the options for how the UK could end the lockdown, but insisted that the government was doing \u201cextensive work\u201d on the various possibilities.\nThe prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWork is underway on an exit strategy but the public wants us to be focused on stopping the spread of the disease while building up the NHS and saving lives \u2026 Whitehall is working extensively on this but the peak is not reached and the government needs to focus in its public messaging on staying at home to save lives.\u201d\nOfficials acknowledge it could be difficult to rank sectors according to their importance to the economy, how much social contact they involve and the strength of their protective measures to keep people apart.\nBut they said it was more possible than other ideas that have been floated in recent days, such as letting 20 to 30-year-olds go back to their normal lives before older people.\nOther ideas that have been raised by government scientists include \u201calternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures\u201d for most of the year or providing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to those who have had the disease, although that would only work with a functioning home antibody test.\nThe lockdown measures \u2013 which were announced on 23 March \u2013 were first scheduled to be reviewed after three weeks, on Easter Monday. The legislation drawn up to implement the lockdown must be reviewed at least once every 21 days, making 16 April the latest this can be done.\nRaab chaired a Cobra emergency committee on Thursday afternoon to discuss the lockdown with leaders of the devolved nations and the mayor of London. He said on Thursday evening that the government did not expect to say more about the possible easing of physical distancing measures until the end of next week.\nIt is understood that tightening the lockdown is under greater consideration at this point, although Priti Patel, the home secretary, told TalkRadio on Thursday that the government was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d considering any further physical distancing measures.\nOne official said some Tory ministers and advisers have been pushing for the lockdown to end sooner rather than later, but that the current thinking was that it would have to last for another six to eight weeks.\nBoris Johnson\u2019s hospital admission and spell in intensive care had undermined the case of those pushing for schools and workplaces to soon get back to normal, the source said.\nIndustry leaders were briefed at the end of last week on the government\u2019s ideas about a possible sector-by-sector approach when the lockdown ends, with manufacturing, logistics and food supply companies likely to be at the front of the queue if they are not still open already.\nOne person familiar with the government\u2019s thinking said that the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, was concerned about the idea, fearing compliance with the rules would collapse once the public could see workers from some sectors returning to a more normal life.\nThe government\u2019s scientific advisers remain particularly concerned about the risk of a second wave of infections if the rules are relaxed too soon, the source said \u2013 but Whitehall officials are conscious of the prime minister\u2019s desire to see them loosened as soon as possible.\nJohnson and his ministers have acknowledged that widespread testing will be part of the answer, but the scientific advisers have said the capacity to roll out mass testing for live cases across the population is unlikely.\nLabour is pushing for the government to publish an exit strategy even though the end of the lockdown is likely to be some way off, as the public would need to have confidence in the approach and time to get used to the idea.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the recently appointed shadow home secretary, said: \u201cWhile we acknowledge the difficulty in putting precise times on the strategy, one of the key reasons publication is necessary is to enable frontline emergency services to plan effectively.\n\u201cThis is especially important in areas such as policing, where clear plans will need to be in place to ensure a managed process. That is why I urge the home secretary to help get an exit strategy published, as it\u2019s a vital part of securing public confidence in the government\u2019s approach.\u201d",

When I joined in the 1950s, the civil service had maintained the wartime tradition of trust and cooperation between ministers and senior officials \u2013 and Armstrong\u2019s distinguished career eminently reflected that tradition in later times.\nA crisis (such as coronavirus) would be met by forming a committee of ministers (not joint minister-officials like Cobra), supported by a committee of senior officials to coordinate the work of relevant departments, which would then brief their ministers \u2013 all organised by the Cabinet Office, which would brief the prime minister. This matched the theory of \u201ccabinet government\u201d. Special advisers were few, mainly experts like the \u201cHungarian twins\u201d \u2013 economists Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor \u2013 and scientific adviser Solly Zuckerman.\nWhat a contrast with the picture that emerges of our current government \u2013 a head of the civil service without much experience of the workings of Whitehall, trying to coordinate the work of departments headed by permanent secretaries who were appointed to make huge cuts in the service and are now struggling to win the trust of small-state politicians surrounded by clamorous special advisers and instinctively suspicious of departmental advice.\nBut I am absolutely confident that the tradition is still there and that everyone is doing their very best in these challenging times.Sir Alan BaileyPermanent secretary, Department of Transport, 1986-91\n The letter above was amended on 10 April 2020 to restore the words \u201cthe picture that emerges of\u201d, which had been lost during the editing process.",

        "content": "Exclusive: Housing secretary made trip despite telling public to stay home except for essential journeys\nThe cabinet minister Robert Jenrick is facing questions after travelling to visit his parents at the weekend, despite repeatedly urging the public to stay at home during the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.\nThe Guardian has established that the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own.\nA witness has told the Guardian they saw Jenrick, 38, visiting the property at the weekend.\nA source close to the cabinet minister admitted that he had made the journey during lockdown conditions, but defended the trip by saying he dropped off food and medication, and did not enter the house. Jenrick later confirmed this in a tweet in which he said his parents were both self-isolating, because of age and his father\u2019s medical condition, and he had respected social distancing rules.\nGovernment instructions say: \u201cYou should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.\u201d The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.\nThe Guardian understands that the local community has been supporting Jenrick\u2019s parents by delivering groceries in recent weeks. This was not denied, though the source said Jenrick had collected and delivered medication for his parents, too.\nOn Thursday night it emerged that the minister had also travelled between London and his home in Herefordshire, which is not in his constituency of Newark in Nottinghamshire.\nIn an article for the Mail on Sunday just over two weeks ago, Jenrick argued that rather than relatives travelling, local communities should help out. \u201cWhile we create physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for our neighbour,\u201d he wrote.\nThe visit came after Jenrick appealed for people not to visit their family on Mother\u2019s Day. \u201cThe advice today is very clear, we need to stay at home for all bar the most essential activities, and by doing that we\u2019ll protect the NHS and help to save lives,\u201d he told Sky News on 22 March. \u201cI know it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and I know it\u2019s tough and it goes against everything that we want to do as a family but don\u2019t go and see your mum. Give her a phone call, Skype her, FaceTime her, tell her that you love her and that we\u2019re going to get through this together.\u201d\nJenrick was seen by a witness in his parents\u2019 front garden. His father and mother, who are 79 and 69, live in a detached house in a town in Shropshire. It is more than an hour\u2019s drive from the MP\u2019s home in Herefordshire, from where he has been doing TV interviews.\nWhile Jenrick\u2019s decision appears to contrast with his instructions to the public, it will be familiar to many facing the dilemma of whether to help elderly parents or stay away.\nScotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was forced to quit at the weekend after facing intense criticism for breaking her own rules by twice visiting her second home during the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe Friday before Jenrick went to see his parents, he tweeted: \u201cIf you are considering going out this weekend, please don\u2019t, unless it\u2019s for work (where you cannot work from home), health reasons, food shopping or exercise. We need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d\nIn a strongly worded comment piece for the Mail on Sunday on 22 March, Jenrick reinforced his message urging the country to stay at home on Mother\u2019s Day. He wrote: \u201cWe are facing a huge challenge on a scale not seen since the second world war. It\u2019s not just a national emergency, it\u2019s a global emergency \u2013 one which puts some of us at more risk than others. The choices that we must make over the coming days and weeks can save many lives.\n\u201cThat means families making big sacrifices \u2013 especially today, on Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s so important that we speak to our loved ones as much as we can \u2013 whether that\u2019s FaceTime or a phone call. But for now, we must practise social distancing in order to tackle the spread of the virus. We need to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. But while we create physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for our neighbours.\u201d\nIn the article, the minister highlighted that those who were self-isolating and did not have support from family, friends or neighbours would receive support from volunteers.\nOn Thursday, Dominic Raab signalled the government\u2019s continued advocacy of the stay-at-home policy, telling the public: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we\u2019ve all made.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are not done yet. We must keep going.\u201d\nResponding to the Guardian\u2019s story, Jenrick tweeted: \u201cFor clarity \u2013 my parents asked me to deliver some essentials \u2013 including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father\u2019s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.\u201d\nOn the subject of his travel between Herefordshire and London, Jenrick told the Daily Mail: \u201cMy house in Herefordshire is the place I, my wife and my young children consider to be our family home and my family were there before any restrictions on travel were announced.\n\u201cI have been working in London on ministerial duties, putting in place the system to shield the group most vulnerable to coronavirus and organising the response at a local level. Once I was able to work from home it was right that I went home to do so and be with my wife and also help care for my three young children. By staying at home, we protect the NHS and help save lives.\n\u201cI will be staying at my family home until government advice changes or if I am needed in person in Westminster before the parliamentary session resumes after the Easter recess.\u201d",

But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u00a0Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days.\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.\nIf you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\nAfter 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.\nIf you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.\nIf you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.\nStaying at home means you should:\nYou can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise \u2013 but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.\nIf you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u00a0NHS 111 coronavirus service\u00a0to find out what to do.\nSource:\u00a0NHS England\u00a0on 23 March 2020\nSome hospitals are responding to what bosses fear will be a shortage of the gowns lasting until at least the end of next week by trying to adapt boiler suits bought from DIY shops and ponchos usually worn at outdoor events as adequate replacements. Others are reclassifying certain areas of care as low-risk rather than high-risk in an attempt to conserve supplies.\nThe Royal Free is finding it impossible to ensure it has adequate supplies despite its ICU \u2013 one of the biggest and most admired in the NHS \u2013 playing a key role in the fight against Covid-19 and it being a regional centre for treating infectious diseases.\nThe two memos, both seen by the Guardian, contradict repeated assurances by ministers and NHS bosses that they are getting on top of the widespread shortages of PPE that have produced panic and fear among frontline staff. A lack of gowns, aprons, face masks and visors has been implicated in the growing number of NHS doctors, nurses and other staff dying after contracting Covid-19.\nDowning Street on Thursday sought to reassure alarmed staff that the NHS is improving the supply of PPE by disclosing that 33m items were delivered to hospitals, GP surgeries and other places of care alone on Wednesday. In all, 600m pieces of PPE have reached the NHS frontline over the last month, No 10 insisted.\nThe shortage of gowns in particular is worrying hospital bosses as they are a vital element of the full PPE which NHS staff are meant to wear when undertaking any aerosol-generating procedures, in which a patient may expel droplets from their mouth or nose.\nOne hospital chief executive said: \u201cThere simply aren\u2019t enough gowns in hospitals going into Easter weekend, despite there being thousands of patients in intensive care units and other areas of hospitals with Covid-19, and we are going to have to cover the guts of a week with no new gowns. This is a disaster in waiting for staff health.\n\u201cThis is a massive problem because the new guidance on PPE that Public Health England (PHE) brought out last week says that staff working in high-risk areas full of Covid patients need to covered below the elbow. That\u2019s a reversal of the \u2018bare below the elbow\u2019 policy that\u2019s been adopted across the NHS since MRSA emerged as a problem.\n\u201cAs chief executives we said to PHE: \u2018If you\u2019re going to use the guidance to require NHS staff to wear gowns more often then you had better ensure that there are always plenty of them available\u2019. They said they would. But here we are without enough gowns this weekend.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said that it was a national problem and that he had had \u201creports from a number of trusts that their supply of clinical gowns is getting tight\u201d. However, the memo sent to London bosses appears to undermine national NHS leaders\u2019 pledges to Hopson that \u201cthere are sufficient stocks of gowns already in the system \u2026 further deliveries of gowns [are] scheduled to arrive shortly\u201d.\nNHS England and ministers have insisted that shortages of PPE are due to \u201clocal distribution issues\u201d rather than inadequate supplies and that they have scaled up deliveries over the past three weeks, often using army trucks to help. However, NHS staff groups say that problems persist despite those efforts.\nThe Royal College of Nursing this week told the Commons health select committee that nurses \u201care facing impossible decisions between their own or their family\u2019s health and their sense of duty\u201d.\nThe Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK), a network of grassroots medics, said the lack of gowns was a potential \u201cdisaster\u201d.\n\u201cEmployers have a legal obligation to provide the correct level of protective equipment to their employees when they are engaged in hazardous work.\n\u201c[NHS staff] should always be wearing the correct PPE for any given situation. Not knowing when vital PPE stock will be available signals the need for the government to urgently get a grip of the situation to protect the frontline\u201d, said Dr Rinesh Parmar, DAUK\u2019s chair.\n\u201cNews of these reports represents nothing short of a disaster for the NHS and its employees. It corroborates what the DAUK has been hearing from frontline doctors for weeks and contradicts the line that this is a simple distribution issue.\u201d\nAn NHS supply chain spokeswoman said: \u201cWe recognise that some trusts have low stocks of gowns and we are working hard with NHS England and NHS Improvement and across government as part of a central team to ensure those with the greatest need are prioritised to receive deliveries.\u201d \n Noting that it was crucial all PPE meets safety standards, she said that 119,000 gowns had been delivered in recent days, with more expected soon.",

The ways and means facility \u2013 effectively, the government\u2019s account at the Bank \u2013 is \u201cpre-existing\u201d and \u201clong-established\u201d. It will be used now only on \u201ctemporary and short-term\u201d basis; \u201cany drawings will be repaid as soon as possible before the end of the year\u201d. We get the picture.\nAnd, yes \u2013 for the time being, at least \u2013 we should trust the assurances. Technically speaking, use of the ways and means facility counts as monetary financing of government because the gilts market is being bypassed, but this exercise is still a long way from being seriously unconventional.\nIt has been done relatively recently \u2013 a key point. The ways and means account, which stands at \u00a3400m during normal times, reached \u00a320bn at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The overdraft may exceed that level this time but, as long as the balance returns to \u00a3400m-ish by Christmas, it\u2019ll be a financial footnote.\nIndeed, one could applaud the Treasury for being smart. Its borrowing requirement has gone through the roof as the state picks up the wages of furloughed workers: \u00a345bn of gilts are due to be issued in April.\nSince the previous monthly record was \u00a328bn, the risk is that bond investors demand higher rates of interest to swallow large mouthfuls of government IOUs. So best to use the overdraft facility to allow time for digestion. The gilts still get issued in the end in the normal way.\nSo why the paranoia about any whiff of helicopter money or money-printing? That\u2019s easy to explain: temporary financial measures, adopted in the midst of crisis, have a habit of becoming permanent. In the banking crash, central bankers reached for quantitative easing, meaning the purchase of financial assets, and they\u2019re still using the technique.\nSince Covid-19 is likely to blow a bigger hole in the nation\u2019s finances than the banking mess did, almost anything seems possible now. In the budget, which was only a month ago, the UK borrowing requirement for this financial year was predicted to be 2.4% of GDP. Now 10%, or roughly \u00a3200bn, is the consensus forecast \u2013 and that assumes normal life returns by late summer.\nTo repeat, no Rubicons were crossed on Thursday. Firing up the ways and means overdraft is not proper monetary financing, as long as it is temporary. Markets took it calmly and sterling barely moved. But large cracks are appearing in the public finances. Truly unconventional policies may yet be deemed a necessary way to fill them.\nSir Stelios Haji-Ioannou wants easyJet to cancel outright its big order aircraft from Airbus. What the airline announced on Thursday was very different: a mere deferral of the delivery of 24 planes.\nCue more fury from Monaco as Haji-Ioannou denounced the boardroom \u201cscoundrels\u201d for being \u201cas clear as mud\u201d about what easyJet actually intends to pay Airbus and when. \u201cA deferral is the same as kicking the can down the road,\u201d he raged.\nIt\u2019s entertaining stuff, but one suspects Haji-Ioannou will struggle to ignite his attempted rebellion against the board. Why? Well, other shareholders probably still fancy easyJet\u2019s chances of bagging some market share when Europe returns to flying. A lot of smaller airlines simply aren\u2019t going to survive.\nThe market itself may be smaller, of course. The pace at which passengers will return is anybody\u2019s guess. But that is why can-kicking on plane deliveries is the correct strategy, easyJet might reasonably argue. The game is about maximising flexibility; further negotiations with Airbus may be possible.\nJohan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive, could do all shareholders a favour in next week\u2019s trading statement, however. EasyJet has taken a \u00a3600m Bank of England-backed loan but has yet to describe the rate at which it is burning cash while grounded. The figure is critical \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to hide it from investors.",

It means, among other things, that members of the House will be able to use video conferencing to dial in remotely to parliamentary proceedings.\nThe Lords authorities also plan to re-examine how much members receive in allowances given that they will not be expected to travel to attend the Palace of Westminster.\nSigned by Lord Speaker Fowler as well as the upper chamber\u2019s political leaders, the letter said they had agreed that oral statements and oral questions should be conducted online from 21 April. They said they plan to ensure that general debates and certain stages of legislation will also be held virtually at some point in the future.\nThe letter, signed by Fowler, Labour\u2019s leader of the opposition Baroness Smith, the leader of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 in the Lords Lord Newby and the Conservatives\u2019 leader of the house Baroness Evans, said that initially, participation in virtual proceeds would be limited, with a view to expansion in the future.\n\u201cThe leaders, convenor and Lord Speaker have agreed that as a priority oral questions and oral statements should be, as much as possible, held virtually. A number of committees have been doing some of their work remotely over this period and that will continue once the house returns.\n\u201cFor fully virtual sessions, there may need to be a limit on the number being held each day to ensure Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS) resources are available, but work on this continues.\n\u201cWe are also working towards a position in which other types of business \u2013 general debates, certain stages of legislation \u2013 can be undertaken virtually, but we are going to have to make progress on a step-by-step basis,\u201d the letter said.\nMindful that some of the chamber\u2019s older members may struggle with technology \u2013 their average age is 70, according to data from 2019 - the letter urges peers to acquaint themselves with Microsoft Teams so that they can participate.\n\u201cWe would strongly encourage all members to use the period before the house meets to familiarise themselves with the platform as this will be the means by which members can participate in any virtual proceedings,\u201d it said.\nThe body overseeing the House of Lords will also re-examine how much peers receive in allowances under the new system, according to the letter. At present, they can opt to receive an allowance of \u00a3313 per day, plus travel expenses and subsidised restaurant facilities.\n\u201cIn view of the fact we intend a significant amount of business to be able to take place virtually, after Easter the House of Lords commission will look at how the allowances system can be adapted to reflect this new, temporary way of working,\u201d it said.\nOne option could be for peers to be allowed to claim a half-rate, which is currently allowed for work away from Westminster.\nParliament closed early for Easter as members in the Palace of Westminster sought to abide by social distancing measures to slow the spread of Covid-19.\nJacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, announced last week that the government and parliament hoped that appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs also return. It followed demands for a virtual lower chamber from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties.",

        "content": "Study highlights importance of biodiversity as part of strategy to stop planet overheating \nScientists have shown to be true what JRR Tolkien only imagined in the Lord of the Rings: giant, slow-reproducing trees play an outsized role in the growth and health of old forests.\nIn the 1930s, the writer gave his towering trees the name Ents. Today, a paper in the journal Science says these \u201clong-lived pioneers\u201d contribute more than previously believed to carbon sequestration and biomass increase.\nThe authors said their study highlights the importance of forest protection and biodiversity as a strategy to ease global heating. They say it should also encourage global climate modellers to shift away from representing all the trees in a forest as essentially the same.\n\u201cThis analysis shows that that is not good enough for tropical forests and provides a way forward,\u201d said Caroline Farrior, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cWe show that the variation in tropical forest species\u2019 growth, survival and reproduction is important for predicting forest carbon storage.\u201d\nLong-lived pioneers \u2013 a term that has been around for decades \u2013 include species such as mahogany, Brazil nut trees and Ceiba pentandra, which are visible far above the rest of the canopy because they grow fast (at up to twice the speed of plants lower in the canopy) for hundreds of years.\nResearchers believe this is the result of a trade-off between stature and reproduction: they are able to put more energy into putting on biomass than into producing offspring.\nThe study is based on more than 30 years of data collected from old growth and secondary rainforest on Barro Colorado, an island in the middle of the Panama Canal.\nThe scientists grouped the 282 different species of tree into five categories determined by growth, reproduction and longevity. This showed the relative roles of \u201cfast\u201d species that grow and die quickly, \u201cslow\u201d species that grow slowly and reach an old age, \u201cinfertile giants\u201d that live long and reproduce over a long time, and \u201cfertile dwarfs\u201d and small shrubs and low treelets that grow slowly, die young, but produce a large number of offspring.\nBy simulating different combinations of these groups, the scientists were able to build a model that reproduced the dynamics of the recovery of nearby young forests.\nThis knowledge of how quickly trees grow, how long they live and how many offspring they produce could help in the restoration of tropical forests, which are currently being cut down at an alarming rate. It could also dispel a theory that such giant trees disappear once a forest reaches maturity.\n\u201cOur results show long-lived pioneers are not transient but an important feature in old forests. They represent about 40% of the biomass and there are no signs that this declines over time,\u201d said the paper\u2019s lead author, Nadja R\u00fcger of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research and the University of Leipzig. However, she cautioned that others forest showed different patterns.",

The league contacted its clubs after a board meeting on Thursday.\nA decision is expected to be made next week, with each club able to vote for or against the proposal to cancel the remaining fixtures this season. Play-offs remain a possibility. Despite several meetings in recent weeks, the board has been unable to find a resolution to the season. National League clubs have around eight matches of the regular season left but Barnet, for example, have 11 games remaining. Clubs in the National League North and National League South have between seven and 12 matches remaining.\nIt is unclear whether teams would vote on current ranking or points per game, with clubs baffled by the decision to be asked to vote without knowing the implications. One club official accused the league of panicking and being \u201camateurish\u201d in its approach. The league is understood to be keen to find a swift solution with many non-league players out of contract at the end of the month.\nClubs previously returned a questionnaire detailing the level of financial help required following the coronavirus outbreak and the responses suggested the 68 clubs are facing a shortfall of around \u00a317m. The letter on Thursday read: \u201cThe board has approved an ordinary resolution for clubs, that the playing season shall immediately end for all fixtures scheduled up to and including 25 April 2020.\n\u201cThe board recommends clubs vote for this resolution. If the ordinary resolution is passed and the remaining \u2018normal season\u2019 league matches of the season are cancelled, the league will then immediately proceed with a poll of North and South clubs to determine the outcomes of the season across those divisions. This will be followed by a vote to determine the outcomes of the season in the National Division. The appropriate options to determine the outcomes of the season are being diligently prepared, and will be approved by the board before they are sent to clubs in due course.\u201d\nThe Football Association has confirmed that the league season in several tiers of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game is to be declared null and void, despite the pleas of more than 60 clubs.\nCompetition in men\u2019s non-league football from tiers three to seven, women\u2019s football from tiers three to seven and all grassroots football have been struck from the record books. The decision was confirmed on Thursday by the FA council, with the continuation of play deemed impossible because of the coronavirus crisis.\n\u201cThe request to end the 2019-20 season was taken to the FA council by the representatives of the relevant committees having been fully supported by the FA board,\u201d an FA spokesman said. \u201cThe FA council\u2019s vote today was overwhelmingly in favour of ratifying the decision.\u201d\nFollowing the FA board\u2019s verdict on 26 March, 64 non-league clubs wrote to the FA condemning the \u201cneedless and inexplicable haste\u201d to stop the various competitions when other leagues \u2013 including the men\u2019s National League \u2013 had merely been suspended.\nThe FA always insisted the decision had been taken with full support of the leagues involved. In a lengthy statement setting out the reasons for annulment the FA\u2019s head of national league system, Laurence Jones, cited \u201csignificant operational challenges\u201d as being behind the decision.\n\u201cIn some leagues, clubs have as many as 16 matches left to play,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the basis that a club was able to play up to two matches per week, this would require at least eight weeks to play out those fixtures.\n\u201cThis is before consideration is given to time needed for players to become match fit and for play-off matches to take place prior to the beginning of the 2020-21 season. Notwithstanding the fact that it may not be possible at this level, practically or logistically, for clubs to play up to two matches per week.\u201d",

        "content": "The northern islands of the Pacific nation were hit by a category-5 cyclone on Monday, flattening buildings, cutting power and stripping trees\nThe once-lush forest cover of the island of Malo has been completely denuded. Nearly every tree lost major limbs. Many were snapped at the trunk. Even cyclone-adapted coconut trees were strewn about like matchsticks. Schools and homes were destroyed.\nOn Monday, the tiny Pacific island country of Vanuatu was rocked by Cyclone Harold, the second category-5 storm to hit the nation in five years. The cyclone, which formed off Solomon Islands and led to the deaths of 27 people who were swept off a ferry in rough seas, went on to flatten buildings and cause severe flooding in Fiji and Tonga. But it passed through the north of Vanuatu when it was at its strongest.\nA small, single-engine plane took off from Vanuatu\u2019s capital of Port Vila on Wednesday to survey the impact on the northern islands of the country. With communication lines down, news up until this point about the extent of the damage has been sparse, but as the plane flew over Malo, then Aore, and finally Santo, the largest island in Vanuatu, it was clear that the cyclone had cut a deadly path.\nSanto, the setting for the book that inspired the Rogers and Hammerstein classic musical South Pacific, was no longer recognisable. Once lush and verdant, it is now barren landscape, sun-burnt and severe.\nThe majority of Santo\u2019s 40,000 inhabitants inhabit the southern coastal stretch of the 100km-long island, which was impacted directly by the storm.\nFor Lord Mayor Patty Peter, the experience was overwhelming. In an emotional phone call to media in Port Vila Tuesday he said, \u201cWe urgently need water, food and shelter at the moment. Many have lost their homes. Schools are destroyed. Electricity is down. I\u2019m urgently calling for help. This is one of the worst experiences of my life.\u201d\nHe later confirmed that food and water were being distributed, but \u201cjust for today and tomorrow. That\u2019s all that we can do.\u201d\nThe town has shrugged off smaller cyclones countless times in the past. \u201cBut this one, like, it\u2019s a nightmare. It\u2019s a nightmare for all the people in the northern islands,\u201d said Peter.\nThe damage wrought by Cyclone Harold is sickeningly reminiscent of the impact of Cyclone Pam in 2015, which directly impacted half the national population and damaged 90% of buildings in the capital, Port Vila. Vanuatu\u2019s economy is only just recovering. With borders still closed under a state of emergency due to Covid-19, the nation faces immense challenges in rebuilding.\n  Residents in Luganville\u2019s riverside communities were among the worst hit. The Sarakata river rose six to eight metres, flattening homes and damaging many others.\nOne 60 year-old man said: \u201cI\u2019ve lived here 13 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it ... It\u2019s the first time in history we\u2019ve seen it come this high.\u201d\nThere are scenes of community spirit and resilience \u2013 children gleefully clambering through the wreckage, a grandmother with three small children busily limbing a fallen tree blocking the road outside their home \u2013 but there are immense challenges ahead.\nSanto\u2019s central power station was flooded, and kilometres of lines are down, including high tension lines to other southern communities. The municipal water service\u2019s pumps operate on electricity, so Luganville has done without running water since the storm.\nPeople will retrieve all the food they can from their ravaged gardens, but with no way to preserve it, and no prospect of a new crop in the next three months, they face an uncertain future.\nChristina Boelulvanua is a school teacher \u2013or was \u2013 until the Covid-19 crisis sent her home. Forced into exile in 2017 by a volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Ambae, she and her family were trying to build a new life in Luganville.\n\u201cI ran away from the volcano with my kids, thinking 2020 would be a safe place for my kids. And then comes Cyclone Harold.\u201d\nShe is unsure how she will be able to feed her family, given her garden has been destroyed.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re going to feed from what\u2019s available, but after that it means we have to buy from the shop,\u201d said Boelulvanua.\n\u201cMost people live on what\u2019s planted in the garden. Some people who have paid jobs, they can still survive. But others who depend on food crops\u2014I can\u2019t see how they will survive. In rural areas, we depend on food crops, cash crops, we sell to earn money. And now it\u2019s all gone.\u201d",

People aged 70 and older are at higher risk of getting very sick or dying from the coronavirus. And people 85 and over are even more vulnerable, global figures show.\nIn Spain, the army has reported finding dead and abandoned people in their beds after it was drafted in to help disinfect care centres. Care homes in the Madrid region alone have reported the deaths of 4,260 residents who were diagnosed with coronavirus or had associated symptoms since 8 March, the regional government said on Wednesday.\nIn France almost a third of all coronavirus deaths have been of residents in care homes. According to the latest figures released on Tuesday a total of 3,237 people have died in care homes. In Paris alone there were 172 deaths and over 2,300 homes have reported at least one case of Covid-19.\nAt one of the worst affected care homes in Mougins, near Cannes in the Alpes-Martimes, 31 people \u2013 one third of its total number of residents \u2013 have died since 20 March. A spokesperson for the home also revealed that 14 of the 50 staff had tested positive for Covid-19. The family of one resident who died is taking legal action against persons unknown for \u201cendangering a person\u2019s life\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, Le Monde published an op-ed from Monique Pelletier, a former minister for women, who criticised the \u201cincomprehensible and inhumane\u201d way residents in some retirement homes were being treated.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken hundreds of deaths of \u2018the old\u2019 in these establishments \u2026 from Covid-19 for people to finally show some interest in them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFirst of all we \u2018forgot\u2019 to publish the number of them who died daily, reserving that only for those who died in hospital for more than a week, then we learn more than 3,000 have died.\u201d\nShe said many residents had been shut away in their rooms for six weeks without seeing anyone else except hard-pressed staff after visits were banned.\nIn Italy an anomalously high number of recent deaths in the country\u2019s care homes has prompted calls for a parliamentary inquiry. According to figures from the Higher Health Institute (ISS), 3,859 people have died in care homes across the country operated by the RSA organisation since 1 February, of whom 133 had tested positive for coronavirus and 1,310 suffered symptoms connected with it.\nHowever, Giovanni Rezza, the ISS\u2019s chief epidemiologist, told reporters on Tuesday the figures are underestimates, given that few tests have been carried out on residents.\nThe majority of the care home deaths have been in Lombardy, the region worst affected by coronavirus and where prosecutors are investigating a care home in Milan where 27 people died of suspected coronavirus in the first week of April.\nRelatives of residents say that resolving the situation must take priority over prosecutions. As hospitals in Lombardy became quickly overwhelmed, little guidance was given on how to handle the virus in care homes, it has emerged.\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in pointing the finger \u2013 what I want to know is, what are we doing to solve this?\u201d said Giorgia Memo, whose mother, Fernanda, is in the Milan care home.\nMemo said that of 25 residents on the same floor as her mother, 18 or so had a fever. She said her mother is also now very weak.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her in over a month. Ten days ago they said tests would be done on everyone. But where are these tests? Do we have to wait until everyone dies before something is done?\u201d\nMemo added: \u201cThe medical staff and assistants in there are outstanding \u2013 they are working 12-hour days and when I call at the end of the day, they still have the energy to tell me how my mother is. But as they are getting sick too, there aren\u2019t many people working there.\u201d\nIn Germany there have been reports of deaths in homes totalling hundreds across the country. In the worst case so far, 29 out of 160 residents at a care home in the northern city of Wolfsburg died after 74 residents became infected. Prosecutors are now investigating the home on charges of death through negligence.\nGerda Hasselfeldt, president of the German Red Cross, described the situation in care homes as \u201cextremely fraught\u201d. \u201cIf we are not careful, over the next few weeks hospitals will have to face the prospect of admitting many patients from care homes,\u201d she warned.\nIreland reported coronavirus clusters in 86 nursing homes on Wednesday, more than double the number from last Saturday, fuelling accusations that authorities moved too slowly to protect some of those most vulnerable to the disease.\nOfficials became alarmed last weekend when there were 40 clusters and announced measures to help nursing homes, including the creation of national and regional infection-control teams, temperature screening of staff twice a day and financial support of up to \u20ac72m.\nMost of the outbreaks are in private facilities, with a minority in those run by the health service. The nursing home sector welcomed the support and said it could cope if staff were given training and equipment.\nIn Canada, health authorities have been grappling with coronavirus cases in long-term care homes across the country. At one retirement home in Bobcaygeon, Ontario, 29 of its 65 residents have died after contracting the virus.\nIn the United States, a home in Kings County in Washington State has become a focus of concern, after 40 people died and staff transmitted the virus to other care homes in the area. In Texas, where there have been serious outbreaks, authorities have refused to release any statistics on infections or deaths in care homes. Authorities in California have urged people to remove their relatives from care homes wherever possible.\nMany countries are also reporting a shortage of basic protective equipment and testing kits in care homes, leaving staff vulnerable.\nIn Spain, the CSIF public workers\u2019 union said two care home workers had died from the virus in the Madrid region while another 400 had become infected.\nElvira Gonz\u00e1lez Santos, president of the Aetesys nursing association, said the conditions in many Spanish care homes were finally coming to light, to the relief of the association\u2019s members.\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s been in the media and the government is acting and testing people, people are feeling a little better,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lack of personal protective equipment, which is in high demand and very expensive.\u201d\nThe Red Cross said across Germany care homes were suffering from a lack of protective clothing and disinfectant, which was contributing to the virus\u2019s spread.\nReporting team: Sam Jones in Madrid, Kim Willsher in Paris, Angela Giuffrida in Rome, Rory Carroll in Dublin, Leyland Cecco in Ontario, Enjoli Liston in New York",

The issue of a \u201crecovery fund\u201d yet to be fleshed out will be put to the EU\u2019s heads of state and government at a future summit.\nItaly\u2019s finance minister, Roberto Gualtieri, told reporters: \u201cWe have put on the table of the European Council a recovery fund enabling common debt issuance. Off the table is any conditionality on the use of European stability mechanism financing. Now it\u2019s up to the leaders to take the right decisions.\u201d\nThe Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, said a \u201csensible\u201d deal had been reached. Bailout funds would still come with conditions if the cash was spent on the wider economy rather than a response to the immediate crisis, the minister insisted.\nHoekstra tweeted: \u201cThe [European stability mechanism] can provide financial help to countries without conditions for medical expenses. It will also be available for economic support, but with conditions. That\u2019s fair and reasonable.\n\u201cWe are and will remain opposed to Eurobonds. We think this concept will not help Europa or [Netherlands] in the long term.\u201d\nAgreement was also found on boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new \u20ac100billion scheme proposed by the European Commission to keep fund employee\u2019s salaries if they are put on reduced hours.\nThe finance ministers had faced growing pressure to come to agreement after 16 hours of talks since Tuesday.\nEarly on Thursday, the Italian prime minster Giuseppe Conte had added to the tension by claiming that it was an existential issue for the EU.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge to the existence of Europe,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIf Europe fails to come up with a monetary and financial policy adequate for the biggest challenge since world war two, not only Italians but European citizens will be deeply disappointed.\u201d\nThe start of the latest round of discussions of the finance ministers had been repeatedly delayed on Thursday as the main protagonists, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and France sought to find a way forward between themselves.\nAhead of the full meeting of finance ministers, M\u00e1rio Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister who is president of the Eurozone group, insisted the EU needed to build a financial safety net as Europe \u201cdipped into recession\u201d with \u201call in lockdown, casualties rising by the hour and with no end in sight\u201d.\n\u201cWe either sink or swim together\u201d, Centeno had said as he called on ministers to show the \u201cnecessary spirit of compromise\u201d.\nFollowing agreement, Centeno told the ministers: \u201cWe acted decisively for our citizens in less than a month\u201d.\nThe negotiations on the EU\u2019s fiscal response to the epidemic exposed deep divisions between north and south, and reignited feelings of bitter enmity last experienced during the financial crisis.\nThe Dutch government with the support of Germany, Finland and Austria, led rejection of the central demand of the Italian government for \u201ccoronabonds\u201d which would involve all EU member states borrowing from the markets on the same terms.\nThe issuing of joint bonds would create joint liability and make borrowing more expensive for the wealthier northern member states as it cheapens it for the rest, at a time when the gap between German and Italian bonds is rising.\nThe Dutch parliament has backed its government on its approach, with politicians warning that anti-EU sentiment would be inflated in the wealthier member states as well if the electorate concluded that their money was being misspent.\nAustria\u2019s finance minister, Gernot Bl\u00fcmel, said the Netherlands had not been standing alone. \u201cThat is out of the question for us,\u201d he said of the issuing of coronabonds. \u201cThat remains the case. We were also not in favour of this formulation because the idea opens the door to a mutualisation of debt ... It was not just the Netherlands.\u201d",

Direct, fact-based and consistent.\u201d\nDuring the first week of lockdown when Bloomfield was given a Saturday away from work the country\u2019s biggest news website ran a prominent story: \u201cAshley Bloomfield is Finally Having a Day Off\u201d and Corin Dann, host of RNZ\u2019s Morning Report added: \u201cI think the whole country would say this is well-earned.\u201d\nICYMI Ashley Bloomfield's face when he heard @henrycooke's question about Instagram influencers saying 5G is causing Covid-19 pic.twitter.com/IdwlEeTuws\nA petition for Bloomfield to be awarded New Zealander of the year is gaining traction, celebrating the \u201ccompetent, calm, factual and reassuring man\u201d.\n\u201cDr Ashley Bloomfield may just be doing his job, but I believe he is exceeding at it and what is expected of him in his role,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cHis reassurance during NZ\u2019s time of need is amazing.

Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar\u2019s firsthand account of the Gallic wars, says \u201cthe Britons consider it contrary to divine law to eat the hare, the chicken or the goose. They raise these, however, for their own amusement or pleasure.\u201d\nRadiocarbon analysis of hare and chicken skeletons from a number of sites in Hampshire and Herefordshire backs up that assertion, showing that the two species were introduced simultaneously to Britain between the fifth and third centuries BC. Excavation has previously revealed the animals had been carefully buried without being butchered.\nProf Naomi Sykes from the University of Exeter, who is leading the research, said: \u201c\u201cEaster is an important British festival, yet none of its iconic elements are native to Britain. The idea that chickens and hares initially had religious associations is not surprising as cross-cultural studies have shown that exotic things and animals are often given supernatural status.\n\u201cHistorical accounts have suggested chickens and hares were too special to be eaten and were instead associated with deities \u2013 chickens with an iron age god akin to Roman Mercury, and hares with an unknown female hare goddess. The religious association of hares and chickens endured throughout the Roman period.\n\u201cHowever, archaeological evidence shows that as their populations increased, they were increasingly eaten, and hares were even farmed as livestock. Rather than being buried as individuals, hare and chicken remains were then disposed of as food waste.\u201d\nThe cross-disciplinary academic team, whose objective is to investigate the origins of Easter traditions and the animals that have come to be associated with it, has previously revealed that the first rabbits were introduced to Britain not by the Normans, as was previously thought, but by the Romans, who arrived in the first century AD.\nHares and chickens were both farmed for food during the Roman occupation of Britain, but in the economic collapse following the Roman withdrawal in 410AD rabbits became locally extinct and the populations of chickens and brown hares crashed.\nHistorical and archaeological evidence show rabbits were reintroduced to Britain as an elite food by the Normans in the 11th century. Rabbits were increasingly common in the 19th century, probably contributing to their replacement of the hare as the Easter bunny when the festival\u2019s traditions were reinvigorated by the Victorians.",

The Guardian revealed last month that ministers were pushing universities to consider a cap.\nThe proposal would result in universities in England and Wales temporarily capping their UK and EU undergraduate intake at the forecasts that they have already submitted, plus a maximum increase of 5%. Students already holding firm conditional offers will be guaranteed their places if they meet their grade requirements.\nSources at several leading universities say they expect the falls in international student numbers and research grants next year alone to cost them hundreds of millions of pounds, while lost income from conferences, accommodation and catering will drain \u00a3790m from the sector by the end of summer.\nSt Andrews\u2019 principal, Sally Mapstone, warned her staff on Thursday that the university had already lost \u00a325m as a direct result of the coronavirus crisis, which would force it into significant cost-cutting.\n\u201cIt is as serious a financial crisis as our university has faced in modern times, and it will mean that we cannot do everything you want or expect us to, and that we have to take some very difficult decisions about our future,\u201d Mapstone said.\nThe proposal by UUK, representing 137 institutions, gives dire warnings of the financial difficulties in which many universities find themselves, with campuses shut and students abruptly leaving.\n\u201cWithout government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision. Some will be in places where they are the only local higher education provider with damaging impact on the local community and economy,\u201d states the document agreed by vice-chancellors on Wednesday.\nAlistair Jarvis, UUK\u2019s chief executive, said it was without question that British universities were likely to go bankrupt without further support: \u201cThere is a very significant chance of some institutions going bust \u2013 and part of this proposal is to prevent that from happening.\u201d\nBut its plans were attacked by the University and College Union as \u201cpiecemeal\u201d measures that fail to fix the sector\u2019s weaknesses. \u201cUniversities need to step back from the dog-eat-dog approach of recent times and come together properly in the wider interest. We fear these proposals risk leaving many universities vulnerable,\u201d said Jo Grady, UCU\u2019s general secretary.\nThe UUK scheme also offers to \u201creduce costs, increase efficiency and moderate certain behaviours\u201d such as curbing unconditional offers, as well delaying capital spending and freezing recruitment. It also calls for a \u201ctransformation fund\u201d to \u201creshape and consolidate\u201d the sector through mergers.\nIts requests include doubling quality-related government research funding from \u00a32bn to \u00a34bn a year, as well as assistance for universities relying on \u201cvery high numbers\u201d of international students. Others include giving universities unrestricted access to the UK government\u2019s coronavirus business support programmes.\nVice-chancellors also want the government to make a multi-year commitment to offering loans and financial support for institutions \u201csuffering significant income losses\u201d.\nUUK warned that the loss of valuable international student fees would end the ability of universities to cross-subsidise expensive science and technology research. Jarvis said losses would hamper their ability to conduct research into pandemics in the long term.\nScottish university sources said their crisis was more acute because of Scotland\u2019s government not fully funding the costs of teaching local students, despite its policy of not charging tuition fees. That increased their dependency on overseas student income.\nUniversity leaders say privately that they do not expect the governments to agree to all the proposals, with some fearing that ministers will \u201ccherry-pick\u201d the least expensive options.",

        "content": "Conflicting accounts by federal and state authorities, and the company\u2019s opaque corporate structure, stand in way of claims by passengers on the ship\nLawyers keen to take action against the owner of the Ruby Princess, Carnival Cruises, face the daunting prospect of figuring out how a global organisation that operates through a series of tax havens can be brought to court in Australia.\nThe company, which pays no tax in Australia, faces a multitude of potential legal suits and potential criminal charges as lawyers and police investigate the events that led to its final cruise from Sydney.\nThe company is in deep financial distress due to the coronavirus pandemic, and even before the outbreak was laden with $10bn of debt that needs to be repaid or renegotiated within the year.\nThe Ruby Princess left Sydney on 8 March and returned early on 19 March after a cruise to New Zealand. Since then there have been more than 660 Covid-19 cases and at least 13 deaths associated with Ruby Princess passengers.\nBut lawyers are now focusing on what happened on the previous cruise, which disembarked on 8 March in Sydney.\nThe Australian has reported that 158 cases of sickness had been logged by the ship in a government portal used to monitor the condition of cruise ship passengers arriving in Australia, leading the Department of Health to classify the ship as \u201cmedium risk\u201d.\nBut it has been widely reported that an email from the ship\u2019s master to the Port Authority of New South Wales on 8 March stated there were \u201cno ill passengers or crew on board\u201d and the ship was permitted to dock, and then load a further 2,700 passengers within a matter of hours.\nThis was a month after the Ruby Princess\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, had been quarantined at Yokohama, Japan, and the world had watched horrified as Covid-19 spread like wildfire through the passengers and crew.\nYet the illness on the Ruby Princess does not appear to have triggered additional safeguards or second thoughts about the next cruise.\nThere is also heightened interest in what the Ruby Princess told the Port Authority and the ambulance service when it docked in the early hours of 19 March.\nAccording to a report in the Sunday Telegraph, there was a series of exchanges at midnight between the Port Authority, executives of Carnival Cruises and ambulance staff, which raise serious questions about whether Carnival was candid about the health of the two passengers transferred and the overall health of the passengers aboard.\nMore than 110 passengers were ill, with 17 showing influenza-like symptoms. Three had been swabbed for Covid-19, but NSW Health and Australian Border Force allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark at 6am and travel home, some on planes interstate, before the test results came in.\nDeciding who, if anyone, can be held to account for the debacle will involve delving into Carnival\u2019s complex corporate structure.\nIn Australia Carnival trades as Carnival Australia but its status and structure is entirely opaque. Until recently, the NAB director Ann Sherry was billed as Carnival Australia\u2019s chairman, but Carnival says she no longer holds the role.\nA search of the corporate registry shows there is no Australian company named Carnival Australia. Instead, the words are a business name owned by one of the companies atop Carnival\u2019s globe-spanning corporate tree, the UK-registered Carnival PLC.\nAccording to Carnival\u2019s filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the group\u2019s only Australian subsidiary is the oddly named A.C.N. 098 290 834, which has paid-up share capital of $100 and is owned by Carnival PLC.\nSherry is not and has never been a director of this company, and Carnival\u2019s spokesman, David Jones, did not respond to specific questions about what it did. Nor did he respond when asked when Sherry ceased to be chairman of Carnival Australia, how she could be an officer of an entity that does not exist and how the group\u2019s local operation was structured.\nAttempts to contact Sherry have been unsuccessful. There is no suggestion that she played any role in the events surrounding Ruby Princess.\nAt the top of the group sit Carnival PLC and another company called Carnival Corporation, which is registered in the Central American tax haven Panama. The two companies operate together as one entity \u2013 a structure that allows it to be listed on stock exchanges in London and New York.\nMost of Carnival\u2019s fleet of more than 100 ships are registered in tax havens around the world \u2013 including Panama, Bermuda and the Bahamas \u2013 although some are registered in the UK.\nThe two companies file one set of accounts, which show that even before the Covid-19 outbreak stranded its ships around the world it was heavily indebted. Accounts filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show Carnival lost US$770m ($1.24bn) in the three months to the end of February.\nIt owed more than $10bn that had to be repaid within 12 months, including $4.7bn in customer deposits for cruises that now mostly appear unlikely to happen, and a further $9.7bn that has to be paid back later on.\nAgainst the $10bn in current debts, it had just $2.9bn in current assets.\nTo help it survive, last week Carnival went to its shareholders and lenders for an emergency cash injection, raising $6.25bn. But despite its US listing, the group isn\u2019t eligible to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s $500bn industry bailout package owing to its offshore structure.\nNeither Carnival PLC nor Carnival Corporation paid any Australian tax in 2017-18, the latest year for which government data is available.\nA.C.N. 098 290 834 is also not listed on a tax office list of large and foreign-owned corporations that paid tax that year.\nJones did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s specific questions about Carnival\u2019s finances, including whether the group was solvent and could refund customers.\n\u201cCarnival Australia represents seven of the corporation\u2019s nine cruise lines that sail in this region,\u201d he said. \u201cWe comply with all listing requirements in the US and the UK including lodgement of reports, which are available for you to see and would cover questions that you have raised.\u201d\nWhether criminal charges will be laid against Carnival or any individual executives or crew members will depend on the police investigation and whether investigators conclude that any actions amount to a deliberate breach of Australia\u2019s strict biosecurity laws.\nCivil claims, however, now seem certain and damages could stretch into the millions, as passengers seek reparation for the cost of cruises and damages for the distress caused by being infected with Covid-19 or living under the threat of being exposed.\nShine Lawyers is preparing a class action on behalf of the 2,700 passengers who were on the Ruby Princess\u2019s final cruise. So far 30 people have signed on, while litigation funders have expressed interest in bankrolling the case.\nShine\u2019s NSW practice leader for class actions, Vicky Antzoulatos, said the firm had already done considerable work on a potential class action against Carnival as it had investigated bringing a similar case in 2019 over several outbreaks of norovirus on the Sun Princess.\n\u201cThere are some jurisdictional issues but it is listed in the UK and this is a giant of world companies,\u201d Antzoulatos said. \u201cWe are confident that despite current events, this company has the wherewithal to pay out.\u201d\nShine\u2019s case would most likely be brought in the federal court and involve claims of breaches of Australian consumer law as well as possible claims of breaches of contract and negligence. At the least, the claim is likely to seek the return of the ticket price to passengers \u2013 estimated by Shine to be an average of $3,000 a person \u2013 and damages for loss of enjoyment.\nGenerally a person cannot sue for disappointment or distress after a breach of contract, but contracts to provide leisure services are different.\nThe issue of damages for disappointment is now before the high court, which has heard argument in a case about Scenic Cruise in Europe in 2013. Because of high water levels, passengers were forced to take buses, rather than cruising Europe\u2019s rivers, prompting a class action by passengers against the cruise company.\nThe passengers on the Ruby Princess potentially have much more to complain about but the high court decision will be an important precedent.\nIn the meantime, Shine will be seeking information on why Carnival chose to run the cruise in the first place, given that the previous cruise had 158 instances of sickness.\n\u201cThe ship was turned around in a matter of hours,\u201d Antzoulatos said. \u201cIt beggars belief that they could have sanitised the ship from top to bottom.\n\u201cThere is a massive issue about disclosure. If passengers had been told that the previous passengers were displaying symptoms consistent with coronavirus, would they have got on?\n\u201cThere are some very serious questions that have to be asked of the operators. They appear to have put profits before the safety of passengers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also had the experience of the ship off the coast of Japan, so they would have been well aware of the risks.\u201d\nShine will be keeping a close eye on the outcome of the criminal investigation, which is likely to yield information and facts to inform the class action.\nThe case is expected to be lodged in the federal court in coming weeks.\nJones, Carnival\u2019s spokesman, told Guardian Australia the company was \u201cnot going to respond to commentary by class action lawyers\u201d.",

        "content": "Antonio Guterres says Covid-19 represents \u2018fight of a generation\u2019 as China wades into row between WHO and Taiwan\nThe head of the United Nations has called the coronavirus pandemic the \u201cfight of a generation\u201d and a threat to world peace and security.\nThe secretary general, Antonio Guterres, warned the UN security council that the pandemic had the potential to increase social unrest and violence, which would greatly undermine the world\u2019s ability to fight the disease.\nIt was, he said, the UN\u2019s most grave test since it was founded 75 years ago and had already hindered efforts to resolve international, regional and national conflicts.\n\u201cThis is the fight of a generation and the raison d\u00eatre [reason for being] of the United Nations itself,\u201d he said.\nMore than 95,000 people had died by Friday morning after contracting Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the figures. More than 1.6 million had been diagnosed as the economic impact continued to grow. One in 10 Americans had lost their job as a result of the virus and the IMF chief said the world was on track for the biggest downturn since the Great Depression.\nGuterres said the world was already seeing the \u201cruinous social and economic impacts. But the pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security.\u201d\nHe warned the pandemic could lead to opportunistic terror attacks, the erosion of trust in public institutions, economic instability, political tensions from postponing elections or referendums, and Covid-19 \u201ctriggering or exacerbating various human rights challenges\u201d.\nHe said security council involvement would be \u201ccritical to mitigate the peace and security implications\u201d and \u201ca signal of unity and resolve from the council would count for a lot at this anxious time\u201d.\nAfter its Thursday meeting with Guterres, which was held via closed video link, the security council issued its first statement since the outbreak began. It expressed \u201csupport for all efforts of the secretary general concerning the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected.\u201d\nAmid the call for unity, China weighed in on a growing row between the World Health Organisation and Taiwan.\nLate on Thursday China\u2019s Taiwan affairs office accused Taiwan\u2019s government of \u201cunscrupulously using the virus to seek independence, venomously attacking the WHO and its responsible people, conniving with the green internet army to wantonly spread racist comments \u2026 We strongly condemn this.\u201d\nIt followed the trading of accusations between the WHO and Taiwan over recent days, largely stemming from Taiwan\u2019s continued exclusion from WHO membership and activities because of lobbying by China\u2019s Communist party government, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory. Taiwan has been successful in preventing a mass outbreak but has repeatedly complained of being left out of the coordinated global response, risking Taiwanese lives.\nThe WHO has been accused of being too deferential to China and praising its virus response despite the government initially suppressing information about the outbreak. The WHO denies the charge and on Wednesday its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he had been subjected to months of attacks including racist ones against him and black communities, and accused Taiwan of condoning the \u201ccampaign\u201d.\nIn response Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry demanded a clarification and apology for the \u201cgroundless\u201d accusation and an \u201cextremely irresponsible act of slander\u201d.\nThe Trump administration has joined in criticism of the WHO, accusing it of putting politics first by ignoring early warnings sounded by Taiwan. The state department on Thursday said the WHO left it too late and \u201cchose politics over public health\u201d.\nThis week Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the WHO, but was accused of seeking to make it a scapegoat in order to distract from his own failings in preparing the US for its own outbreak, which had infected more than 465,000 people and killed almost 15,000 by Friday morning.\nIn other developments:\nEU countries agreed to a \u20ac500bn relief deal for members hit hardest by the pandemic.\nBoris Johnson, the British prime minister, was moved out of intensive care after being admitted three days earlier suffering from coronavirus.\nAround the world people have been told to stay home over the Easter holiday. Authorities in several countries have warned of roadblocks to enforce social distancing.\nChina has stepped up monitoring and reporting requirements for asymptomatic \u201csilent\u201d carriers. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that new challenges to China\u2019s economic and social recovery were emerging.\nThe New York governor said a record 799 people died from Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total loss to 7,067 people. Cuomo warned the economic impact on the state was expected to be worse than 9/11. There were signs of hope, with New York recording its lowest number of new hospitalisations since the outbreak began.\nThe South Korean city of Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows.\nThere have been calls for high-level inquiries into allegations of inhumane treatment in some aged care facilities. Around the world appalling stories have emerged from residential care homes for older people, including in Spain where the army has reported finding dead and abandoned people in their beds.\nThe death toll in UK care homes is likely to be far higher than reported, the Guardian has learned, with hundreds of people dying from confirmed or suspected coronavirus without yet being officially counted.\nBangladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district, which is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar, and South Africa extended its lockdown by a further fortnight, enforced by police and the army.\nThe official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Iran passed 4,000, the country\u2019s health ministry reported on Thursday, after 117 more people were confirmed to have died from the disease in the previous 24 hours.",

        "content": "Attacked by Trump and ignored by many of its most powerful members, the World Health Organization is facing a major crisis \u2013 just at the moment we need it most\nIf, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.\nWatching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO\u2019s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.\nThat is not the world we live in. \u201cThe W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,\u201d tweeted Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.\nMeanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s emergency committee. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d\nOn 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d.\nThere is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.\nThe WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d\nAt the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d\nThe WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.\nOne of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the bifurcated needle, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.\nIf the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.\nTwo things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.\nGiven the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d\nBrundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.\nAlthough the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.\nIn March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued advice against travelling to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.\nBrundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d\nThe WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d\n\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.\nBut the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.\nIf the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.\nFirst, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.\nTo this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)\nFidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.\nWhen the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations deployed more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists judged the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.\nMuch of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.\nThe bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.\nToday, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.\nSince the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently told Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of politicising the virus.)\nUntil very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.\nJohn MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some reports suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)\nDespite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.\nElected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even accused Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros denied the claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.\nWhile his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d\nIf the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan claimed that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.\nNow that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has more cases of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d\nWhile the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.\nRichard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO asked for $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)\nEven the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.\nThe WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.\nBut countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. In Sweden, restaurants are still open.\nMany wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS ordered millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany accused the US of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously sent inspectors to the factory of an American company in J\u00fcchen to ensure their medical masks weren\u2019t being exported against government orders.\nThe WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. \u201cGovernments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,\u201d said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn\u2019t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it \u2013 quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.\nIronically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline \u2013 a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. \u201cAs it\u2019s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,\u201d said Wenham. \u201cNo one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren\u2019t thinking globally.\u201d\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

        "content": "Doubts over the NRL\u2019s intention to restart the competition in May have been highlighted by Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, who expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon.\nEarlier, Brad Hazzard, the New South Wales health minister, said he had not been consulted on the league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time, which was announced on Thursday following meetings of the league\u2019s innovation committee and the ARL Commission.\nChannel Nine, the competition\u2019s broadcasting rights co-holder, has also claimed it had been left out of talks over the resumption proposal.\nSpeaking on Friday, Kelly said he did not believe the NRL should be considered \u201ca law unto themselves\u201d and that the league and its players, like the rest of country, have an important role to play in attempts to control the Covid-19 outbreak.\nKelly also said a return to the field of play on 28 May could be too soon given how rapidly the virus can be spread.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they [the NRL] are a law unto themselves,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cSome of the players and coaches may think so, but they\u2019re part of society and they have a part \u2013 as we have all done \u2013 to support not only safety for themselves but for all of us.\n\u201cWe all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track.\n\u201cWhat we know about this virus, if we don\u2019t have these social distancing measures, [is that] one person can lead to 400 other cases within a month. We just cannot afford at this stage to be considering that happening.\u201d\nGiven their age and health, and that games would be played behind closed doors, Kelly said the cohort of players were of less concern than those around them in a more vulnerable age group \u2013 a group that includes the likes of coaches Wayne Bennett and Ricky Stuart.\n\u201cFor them [the players], it may not be a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other people around the teams \u2013 Wayne Bennett is in his 70s, he would be in a vulnerable group; Ricky Stuart with the mighty Raiders, he would potentially be in a vulnerable group \u2013 so thinking about the team, not just the players but the support around them, is important.\n\u201cThey\u2019re making their plans for the road out [of the shutdown] and I encourage them to do so in other sports. But whether May is the time will remain to be seen and definitely they\u2019ll need to get some permission to do that.\u201d\nExact details over the format of the competition if and when it resumes remain unclear, although an exit strategy is likely to involve a NSW hub centred around Sydney.\nBut Hazzard said on Friday he had not been involved in talks about a restart \u2013 nor had he even spoken with league officials since before the suspension of the season after just two rounds.\n\u201cThe NRL came to see me about a month, or five weeks, ago. There have been no further discussions,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cThe only meeting I\u2019ve had that I can tell you about is around about a month ago, with Todd Greenberg and Peter V\u2019Landys to talk about the issue.\n\u201cBut that was before they actually made a decision to shut the game down. So I haven\u2019t had any discussions with them at this stage.\u201d\nHazzard said he would, however, be open to talks, although a balance would have to be struck between the benefits of the league returning and the safety implications of that.\n\u201cIf the NRL want to go ahead, [I\u2019m] happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Hazzard said.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the right balance, I\u2019m happy to talk to the NRL, because as health minister, I also know that we need to have a sense of balance about our life, a sense of mental health and I know a lot of people enjoy seeing sport.\n\u201cSo we can have that conversation with them. I\u2019m not giving any indication one way or the other.\u201d",

Campaigners say approval should not have been given without first securing a commitment from the government to reverse its discrimination towards pregnant girls and end compulsory pregnancy tests.\nA public notice released earlier this week by Tanzania\u2019s education minister, JoyceNdalichako, said: \u201cThe target [of the loan] is to reach more than 6.5 million secondary school students across the country, without discrimination and shall include girls who drop out of school for various reasons, including pregnancy.\n\u201cThe government is committed to ensure that they continue with their education as prescribed in the project.\u201d\nOf the 60,000 students who drop out of secondary school every year in Tanzania, 5,500 leave due to pregnancy according to World Bank data.\nTanzania\u2019s ban on pregnant schoolgirls dates back to the 60s. Amid renewed criticism, it was reaffirmed in a 2017 speech by Tanzania\u2019s president, John Magufuli, who stated that \u201cas long as I am president \u2026 no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school. We cannot allow this immoral behaviour to permeate our primary and secondary schools.\u201d\nSierra Leone lifted a similar ban last week.\nHuman rights lawyer Judy Gitau, regional coordinator at Equality Now, welcomed Ndalichako\u2019s declaration and said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about \u201cthe first time the government of Tanzania has publicly announced in an official state document that it will include pregnant girls in secondary school education\u201d\nBut El\u00edn Martinez, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the Tanzanian government\u2019s positionremained unchanged. She referred to a recent tweet in Swahili from Tanzania\u2019s chief government spokesperson that indicated the government has set up parallel systems for pregnant girls.\n  \u201cTanzania will continue to arbitrarily deny pregnant girls the right to study in formal public primary and secondary schools \u2013 and they will only have an option of studying in a parallel system, which will now be built using the World Bank\u2019s loan,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, adding that the \u201calternative education pathways\u201d only offer a condensed version of the curriculum, and at a cost.\nThe World Bank has \u201cundermined its own commitment to non-discrimination and to improving the lives of \u2018marginalised groups,\u2019\u201d she said.\nGitau condemmed the parallel system and called for the \u201creintegration of all pregnant girls to mainstream education\u201d.\nIn a factsheet about the programme released last week, the World Bank said the Tanzanian government \u201chas reaffirmed that pregnant girls who enrol in AEP [alternative education pathways] can sit for national secondary school examinations.

        "content": "Crisis destroys foreign sales of shellfish and supermarkets close fish counters causing slump during traditional Easter boom period\nScottish fishermen are turning to food banks and welfare organisations, as the coronavirus crisis has led to plummeting demand for seafood, leaving many unable to work to feed their families.\nWorst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland\u2019s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen\u2019s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified \u201cpockets of need\u201d in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand.\nClaire McIntosh, the Mission\u2019s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been liaising with food banks since January,\u201d said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. \u201cThis is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I\u2019ve handed out \u00a317,500 in the last few weeks, compared to \u00a312,000 for the whole of the last year.\u201d\nThe UK fishing industry is worth \u00a3989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at \u00a3574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent.\n\u201cLangoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,\u201d said David Dickens, the Mission\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a pandemic, people aren\u2019t interested in high quality seafood.\u201d\nThe charity\u2019s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse.\n\u201cAll the indications are we\u2019re at the beginning of a curve of need,\u201d said Dickens. \u201cThis is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there\u2019s a lot of very worried people. We\u2019re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.\u201d\nOn 25 March, the Scottish government announced a \u00a35m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres.\nDickens welcomes the scheme, which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time.\nA further \u00a310m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: \u201cWork on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.\u201d\nThey added that further support is being made available, including a \u00a32.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly.\nDonna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland\u2019s seafood to consumers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.\u201d\nIt was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the \u201cworst weather we\u2019ve seen for 15 years for fleets\u201d, before the Covid-19 crisis hit.\n\u201cThe prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,\u201d said Fordyce. \u201cThe whitefish fleet, some are still going out.\n\u201cIt is going to be a UK market for the next few months.\u201d\nScotland has 2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew.\nAmong those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the \u00a310m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe are waiting with bated breath,\u201d said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get that or we are not eligible, we\u2019re finished.\u201d\nMcMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January.\n\u201cWe are having to pay staff weekly. It\u2019s a huge strain on the business as we haven\u2019t any cash.\u201d\nBased in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village\u2019s largest employers.\n\u201cTwenty-two jobs is a lot of families,\u201d McMillan said.\n\u201cThe whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.\u201d\nSelling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said.\n\u201cEveryone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it\u2019s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.\u201d",

        "content": "Major League Soccer\u2019s ambitious goal of growing into one of the world\u2019s best leagues is ever compromised with so many of its teams still playing on artificial surfaces\nIn every other way, it was a marquee event. The sight of 69,274 fans, a stadium record attendance, packed into CenturyLink Field was enough to illustrate this, although the elaborate pre-game TIFOs, pyrotechnics and \u2018March To The Match\u2019 from downtown Seattle out to the venue only added to the spectacle. Indeed, last year\u2019s MLS Cup final had all the components of a Big Match, besides one: the pitch.\nLike every Seattle Sounders home game since the club\u2019s introduction to the league in 2009, last year\u2019s MLS Cup final was played on an artificial grass surface. FieldTurf, to be precise. It was the same the season before as Atlanta United hosted the Portland Timbers at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. That too was a big time sporting occasion to rival anything produced by the Champions League, Europa League or any other European competition. Just like in Seattle, though, the plastic pitch was out of place.\nArtificial surfaces are permitted in the Champions League, but not for the final. In 2008, for instance, a new grass pitch was hastily laid just a few weeks before the Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester United because the Luzhniki Stadium\u2019s usual plastic pitch was deemed unsuitable for such a big match. This gives a sense of how Uefa truly feel about their use at the elite level of the European game.\nThere is not a single artificial pitch in the Premier League, nor is there one in the Championship. In fact, there isn\u2019t an artificial pitch at any of England\u2019s 42 senior league venues. Even in countries, like Scotland, where plastic surfaces are used, they are much maligned. \u201cI don\u2019t like plastic pitches, I didn\u2019t like playing on them. I think they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d former England and Liverpool captain, now Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard said after a game on an artificial pitch last year and his views are reflective of the wider soccer community.\nMLS and the owners of its member clubs have been unashamedly bullish in their ambition to become one of the best leagues in the sport in the not so distant future, but can that really be achieved with so many teams still playing on artificial pitches?\nWhile MLS has made great strides in the construction of soccer specific stadiums across Canada and the United States over the past decade or so, the sight of plastic pitches in the division is a reminder of the compromises it continues to make. With the exception of the Portland Timbers\u2019 Providence Park, every artificial playing surface currently in MLS is installed at a multi-use stadium.\nIn the case of Atlanta United and the Seattle Sounders, an argument could be made that playing on FieldTurf is a necessary ill. These are, after all, two clubs with fanbases so big they can only be housed in NFL-size super-stadiums. The benefit that comes from that makes playing on a less than perfect pitch worth it, or so some might claim.\nOf course, it should be noted that not all artificial pitches are the same. Some are better than others. The Portland Timbers\u2019 FieldTurf surface, for instance, is widely agreed to better than the artificial surface at Gillette Stadium. Nonetheless, artificial pitches play slightly differently than natural grass ones. Some players refuse to play on them for fear of aggravating knee or ankle injuries - see how Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed almost every match played on plastic during their time in MLS. This is a problem for a league that still uses ageing European stars, such as Henry and Ibrahimovic, as marketing tools.\nThere is little scientific data to suggest that players are more prone to injury on artificial pitches \u2013 one study conducted in the USA in 2013 which looked at female college soccer players actually showed a lower total injury incidence rate and lower total major injury incidence rate on artificial pitches than grass \u2013 but there is no doubting the stigma attached to the use of artificial pitches.\nOne survey, conducted anonymously by ESPN, found that 63% of MLS players would consider whether or not a team plays on grass or plastic as a factor in any transfer decision. Even as far back as 2007 when David Beckham had only just pitched up at the LA Galaxy, there was growing dissent against the presence of artificial surfaces in the league. \u201cEvery game, every team should have grass, without a doubt,\u201d Beckham said at the time. The discussion around plastic pitches in MLS isn\u2019t a new one, but this is a large part of the point. Players continue to feel they aren\u2019t being listened to.\nThe scientific argument against artificial pitches might not be especially compelling, but the detrimental impact they have on soccer as a product is worth discussing. Games on grass tend to be quicker. The ball doesn\u2019t bounce so high, favoring teams who prefer to play on the ground. MLS concerns itself with its packaging more than most leagues and so this is surely one consideration it must make.\nThe argument in defense of artificial pitches usually includes the point that they are still better than a bad grass pitch. But the best leagues, the kind of leagues MLS wants to one day count itself among, don\u2019t play on bad grass pitches. They play on green carpets, commonly of a natural and synthetic consistency. There is certainly no grass pitch in the Premier League like the one New York City FC play on at Yankee Stadium.\nMLS in 2020 is still in a development phase with the league only celebrating its 25th anniversary of establishment this season. On this basis, some leeway is warranted, but just as there is building pressure to raise or abolish the division\u2019s salary cap in order to allow clubs to build fuller and better balanced squads, therefore lifting the quality of play, a move towards an all-grass league should be a stated aim. If the Champions League final wouldn\u2019t be played on it then neither should the MLS Cup final.",

        "content": "The actor and writer, who recently masterminded a viral Shakespeare video, stars in a new drama about life under lockdown and is ready to reveal her one-woman play, Heart\nLast week, Jade Anouka announced on Twitter: \u201cGonna shoot my own short film!\u201d She had been contacted by a theatre company for an acting role, but such are our extraordinary times of social distancing, she was asked to shoot her own footage as well for the nine-minute monologue written by Aisha Zia and directed by Suba Das.\n\u201cIt was down to me to work out the shots. I got some pointers from Suba and recorded it on my iPhone,\u201d says the London-born actor, poet and playwright. She soundproofed her London flat as best as she could and shot snippets of everyday life from \u201cthe view out of the window to my dog sleeping or barking\u201d.\nThe film, Bedlam Before the Burnout, is the first in HighTide\u2019s five-part series Love in the Time of Corona, which will be streamed weekly. The other monologues are written by Olivier-nominated Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Bafta nominee Dawn King, grime poet Debris Stevenson and Ben Weatherill, who wrote the acclaimed play Jellyfish.\nTheatre-making, it seems, has never been so DIY. The series comes amid a welter of new online offerings. Anouka loves the speed and invention of it all and the industry\u2019s quickfire response, but misses the collective experience of live theatre. \u201cIt is devastating and sad,\u201d she says. \u201cIndividuals are dealing with job losses as well as the thought of what this might lead to. Theatre is struggling, but it is such a creative world that I\u2019m not surprised we have come up with ways of keeping performance alive. We know it\u2019s not the same thing as live theatre \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to get back to that \u2013 but you have to keep creating in the meantime.\u201d\nHer own creative responses have included recording a speech from The Merchant of Venice as a rousing reminder of the value of Shakespeare in troubled times. \u201cI woke up one morning and had the idea that it needed to be out there.\u201d Anouka, who has worked on Shakespeare productions at the Globe, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s all-female trilogy at the Donmar, emailed fellow actors to ask for recorded contributions. The response was astonishing: Judi Dench replied within hours with a recording \u2013 \u201cI could tell she wasn\u2019t reading the speech but knew all the words\u201d \u2013 and she heard from Harriet Walter, Meera Syal, Paterson Joseph and Paapa Essiedu.\nSpreading some #Shakespeare love in these theatre-deprived times.With a little help from:#JudiDench @ignatius_sancho @MeeraSyal #HarrietWalter@HoldbrooksMyth @PaapaEssiedu @Simone1Kirby pic.twitter.com/x9qX9xD7FW\nThe result is a moving rendition of the \u201cthe quality of mercy\u201d speech made by Portia. Anouka picked it partly out of sentimental reasons, because it was the first Shakespeare play she performed in professionally (\u201cIt was the RSC\u2019s production, and I was something like fifth spear carrier\u201d) and for its message about kindness: \u201cIt\u2019s just beautiful for its poetry, but there is a reminder in it to be kind to each other.\u201d\nThe HighTide monologue is also a response to a global state of solitude. Anouka plays a woman whose life is brought to a halt by the lockdown and finds herself alone in her house. It leads to deeper reflection on an over-busy life that has left her almost at breaking point and pushes her to make positive re-evaluations.\nAnouka is in isolation with her partner and three-year-old rescue dog (a photogenic terrier mix who features in her Instagram feed). \u201cI don\u2019t feel as positive,\u201d she admits. \u201cThere is too much darkness, although I\u2019m someone who works from home anyway so I think I\u2019ve adapted easier. It must be hard for people doing regular jobs who are now suddenly in their house with family or partners.\u201d\nWhen the lockdown began, Anouka was in the middle of two film projects \u2013 including a thriller for Channel 5 called The Drowning, starring alongside Jill Halfpenny \u2013 which are now postponed. She has writing projects on the go, too. Anouka has long written poetry and in 2016 published a collection, Eggs on Toast, but she is newer to scriptwriting. She has just handed in the draft of a play to Soho theatre with the working title Mother Daughter, and is commissioned to write another for Paines Plough.\nBut before that, her one-woman play, Heart, is scheduled to debut at the Kiln this summer. Directed by Nancy Medina, Anouka will also perform as its lead. She describes it as a story being told by a black woman but with no mention of blackness. In the trailer for the show, she says: \u201cThis is not a black story or a woman\u2019s story, but for all those who have felt \u2018other\u2019,\u201d though she adds now that \u201cas soon as I stand on a stage as a black woman, people will bring their assumptions\u201d.\nThere are dynamic stories around diversity being told in theatre at the moment, but she feels that only certain kinds get plucked for bigger stages. \u201cThe shows that are produced by the mainstream are not representative of the stories that are being told. They seem diluted.\u201d The focus, she adds, is often black experience imported from America. Writers such as Clint Dyer have spoken about the dearth of black British stories on stage, and Anouka feels the same. \u201cWatching a play about black Americans, it\u2019s easy for an audience to feel separate and for the characters on stage to be othered. We really need black British stories.\u201d\nBedlam Before the Burnout is available on HighTide\u2019s YouTube channel. Heart is due to be staged at the Kiln, London, later this year.",

        "content": "Unusually high rates of flu-like illness would be more likely to raise red flags if more people were vaccinated\nHigher influenza vaccination rates could help prevent a future pandemic by exposing new viruses like Covid-19, which was probably circulating much earlier than December 2019 but was mistaken for flu, an expert has said.\nIf more people were vaccinated against flu, unusually high rates of flu-like illness would be more likely to raise red flags, said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor in epidemiology from the University of Manitoba. \u201cGiven that both Covid-19 and influenza share similar early symptoms of illness, influenza vaccination status provides an additional mechanism to help distinguish potential infections that could be responsible for a patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\u201cNow I wonder how many things are written off as influenza where they may be new viruses which could impact world health.\u201d\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic continues, some countries are approaching flu season. Governments have urged as many people as possible to get vaccinated against influenza to reduce the burden on health systems and virus testing labs.\nKindrachuk said flu vaccination rates had traditionally been low and authorities must focus on increasing them. He said Canada should be aiming for 80% of the population but was currently around 20%.\nThe World Health Organization recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups including pregnant women, healthcare workers, people with underlying chronic conditions, the elderly and children under five.\nThe WHO has warned of disruption to routine immunisation activities during the pandemic because of strain on the health system and a \u201cdecreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance\u201d. It says there is a high potential for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles at this time, but mass vaccinations bringing together large groups of people should be avoided. Countries should instead \u201cmaintain continuity of immunisation services wherever services can be conducted under safe conditions.\u201d\nAustralia and New Zealand have begun flu vaccinations early, and have prioritised the elderly, people with disabilities and health workers. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt, has warned of the dangers of people falling ill with both the flu and Covid-19, while his New Zealand\u2019s counterpart, David Clark, said that although the flu shot does not protect people against Covid-19 \u201cit will help to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of demand on our hospitals this winter\u201d.\nSouth Africa has said it will prioritise health workers for vaccinations as it does not have enough, Bloomberg has reported.\nA few weeks before the known start of the coronavirus outbreak, China Daily reported the country had stockpiled twice as many vaccinations as the previous year for the coming winter and spring.\nIn March the Guardian revealed that some Australian jurisdictions had failed to properly stockpile a common reagent that was needed to test for Covid-19 as well as other viruses including influenza. \u201cAs the virus has spread, exhaustion of the reagents and materials required for performing diagnostic testing has resulted in decreased testing capacities which has further exacerbated the tolls from this pandemic,\u201d said Kindrachuk.\n\u201cThis is an important point as many regions, including here in Canada, have now had to adopt more stringent diagnostic testing criteria so as to preserve testing capacity as the pandemic continues.\u201d\nIn recent days a study from 2017-18 has been widely shared on social media, with readers suggesting that it shows flu vaccinations increase the chance of recipients contracting a coronavirus. The WHO\u2019s influenza team said they had not previously seen the report but a brief review of its conclusions showed there was in fact \u201clittle or no evidence of association of virus interference and influenza vaccination \u2026 Conclusions regarding the current Covid-19 pandemic and influenza vaccination cannot be made.\u201d",

From mass singalongs in locked-down Italian towns to the UK\u2019s #chasetherainbow campaign \u2013 which sees crayoned and painted rainbows beaming from windows \u2013 the idea of communities coming together while social distancing has become a beacon of hope for us all.\nIn Japan, a country that has yet to enforce social distancing or announce an official lockdown, that hope has taken the form of a y\u014dkai \u2013 one of a number of supernatural monsters and apparitions that have captured the Japanese psyche for centuries, appearing in everything from Edo period (1603-1868) woodblock prints to modern-day manga.\nJapanese Twitter is currently inundated with depictions of a y\u014dkai called Amabie \u2013 a squat, duck-billed creature with a scaly body, long hair and three webbed feet. But why?\nFor the answer, you have to go back to mid-May 1846, when a town official from what is now Kumamoto prefecture on the island of Kyushu went down to the sea to investigate reports of glowing lights. There he encountered a strange mermaid-like creature. \u201cI am Amabie who lives in the sea,\u201d it said. \u201cFor the next six years, there will be abundant crops across the land, but there will also be epidemics. Show my picture to people as soon as you can.\u201d Then Amabie was gone.\nThe story circulated in newspapers \u2013 as did copycat sightings, including one of a land-based, ape-like version in 1876.Later depictions included, notably, Shigeru Mizuki\u2019s ghosts and ghouls-filled manga GeGeGe no Kitaro (1960-69).\nThough Mizuki passed away in 2015, his production company tweeted his drawing of Amabie on 17 March, with the words: \u201cMay the modern epidemic disappear.\u201d\nWishful thinking maybe, but that one tweet sparked Twitter hashtags such as #amabiechallenge and #amabieforeveryone. While some users, including manga artists such as Mari Okazaki, have been sharing paintings and drawings of Amabie, other Twitter users have been more creative, posting pictures of embroidery, bowls of udon (thick wheat noodles) and bento lunchboxes all inspired by the apparition. Some have even dressed themselves (and their pets) up like Amabie and tweeted the photos alongside their own hopeful messages. And now Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has enlisted Amabie for an awareness flyer it tweeted, urging people to \u201cstop the spread of infection.\u201d\nThe hope \u2014 and sometimes humour \u2014 that accompanies each depiction is real, and Amabie has become a unifying force that has Japan reaching deep into its own obscure past to find solace in uncertain times.",

        "content": "After Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s abortive 15-hour version and David Lynch\u2019s tailspin of an attempt, it is Denis Villeneuve\u2019s turn to ride the sandworm\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine why Hollywood felt it might take a maverick genius to film Dune, Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 sci-fi/fantasy opus. The novel, and its five sequels, are phantasmagorical and psychedelic in the extreme, like Star Wars on acid. In fact, George Lucas borrowed much from Herbert\u2019s story: the witchy women of the Bene Gesserit are not so far from the wise, all-seeing Jedi (though Lucas wisely ditched the former\u2019s freaky, eugenics-influenced breeding programmes). The planet of Arrakis, where the novel\u2019s hero Paul Atreides finds himself caught up in a devious aristocratic plot to bring down his family\u2019s noble house, resembles the desert planet of Tatooine where we first meet Luke Skywalker.\n The first maverick to take on the task was the controversial Chilean-French film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky in the early 1970s. Jodorowsky duly dreamt up a proposed 15-hour film in which Orson Welles was to play Baron Harkonnen, and Salvador Dal\u00ed the emperor, Shaddam IV. HR Giger, the Swiss artist who would later create the xenomorphs for Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien, was brought in to work on the central building, the Harkonnen castle, while Pink Floyd were recruited to help with the soundtrack. Naturally, nobody wanted to fund this insane venture, whose passing into myth is chronicled in the fascinating 2013 documentary Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune.\nDavid Lynch finally got a new version into cinemas in 1984, only for Universal to release a two-hour cut he hated so much he had his name removed from the credits. In fact, Lynch was so disappointed in the film, he often refuses to discuss it in interviews. This is hardly surprising when you consider the awful inner dialogue that was added to the soundtrack for most of the main characters in post-production, seemingly to paper over the cracks from a confusing edit.\n  There are some wonderful moments to be witnessed in what remains of the movie, but it\u2019s still hard to deny that Lynch made a bucketload of inexplicable errors, such as making the Bene Gesserit bald, reducing them to background players and introducing those ridiculous heart plugs, not to mention the disgusting scene in which Kenneth McMillan\u2019s Baron Harkonnen has his face pustules drained. At least the film\u2019s silliest segue, during which Kyle MacLachlan\u2019s Paul and his Fremen allies ride to victory on top of Arrakis\u2019 giant sandworms, has its roots in the original book.\n  Villeneuve has said his adaptation, which is due to hit cinemas in December, is unlikely to resemble Lynch\u2019s lurid take. \u201cI\u2019m going back to the book, and going to the images that came out when I read it,\u201d he told Yahoo. \u201cDavid Lynch is one of the best film-makers alive, I have massive respect for him. When I saw his adaptation I was impressed, but it was not what I had dreamed of, so I\u2019m trying to make the adaptation of my dreams.\u201d \n  The director also says it\u2019s likely that his film will be the first of at least two movies based on Herbert\u2019s original 1965 novel. Dune acolytes suspect this will see the first episode finishing with Paul having established himself as the Fremen\u2019s messiah, the Muad\u2019Dib, with part two focusing on the battle to retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens and the emperor.\nCasting appears to be impeccable, with MacLachlan lookalike Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Rebecca Ferguson as his Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Baron Harkonnen. Villeneuve has also stored up goodwill in spades from science fiction fans after delivering the futuristic double whammy of Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 over the past few years. \n Where Lynch and Jodorowsky seemed to indulge themselves by taking the trippy futurism of Herbert\u2019s original as a jumping-off point into even weirder territory, the suspicion is that Villeneuve will take the hallucinatory lunacy of the source material and do his level best to drawn it into a cohesive tale, like a conductor who finds himself charged with taming an orchestra of eccentric musicians. \n Perhaps what Dune really needs is not a maverick genius at all, but merely a genius. In Denis Villeneuve, the long-awaited film adaptation might have finally found just that.",

Plus, 6.6m jobs lost in a week in the US\nGood morning, I\u2019m Mattha Busby with today\u2019s essential stories.\nNext week this briefing will look a little bit different, and be called First Thing. You don\u2019t need to do anything: it will still contain everything you need to know as you wake up, and be delivered every weekday morning. But now spring is here, we thought it was a good time to freshen it up, and we hope you like the new changes as much as we do.\nConfirmed coronavirus deaths around the world have exceeded 95,000 and there are at least 1.6m cases. Countries including Spain and Italy report their rates of infection are beginning to plateau while others, such as Russia, announce record 24-hour rises. Many countries now enter the Easter and Passover holidays, or look towards the Ramadan month of fasting, as citizens are told to continue to abide by physical distancing measures.\nWarnings. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, the World Health Organization warned of the human-to-human transmission risk as early as 10 January and urged precautions, though it did tweet days later appearing to contradict itself.\nIgnored. Many of the WHO\u2019s most powerful members snubbed its advice and are now playing catch-up or suffering consequences, while the organisation, whose budget is smaller than many hospitals, is caught in US-China rivalry.\nNew York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus toll for the third consecutive day on Wednesday as 799 deaths were announced. City officials have contracted laborers to bury the rising number of victims in an area long used to bury those with no known next of kin. The state governor, Andrew Cuomo, warned the effect of the outbreak on the state\u2019s economy was expected to be more devastating than 9/11 and pointed to the 1918 Spanish flu, which came in three waves.\nTribute. Frank Gabrin, 60, America\u2019s first ER doctor to die treating Covid-19 patients, had voiced concerns over the lack of protective equipment at New York hospitals and had worn the same mask for several shifts.\nDeath toll. The infectious diseases chief, Anthony Fauci, has dismissed baseless \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d that the official number of US deaths from Covid-19 has been overstated after claims on rightwing media.\nBolthole. A businessman from Manhattan rented a mansion with a bowling alley in Long Island \u2013 now one of the worst-hit areas of New York state \u2013 for almost $2m until the end of September in an attempt to flee the pandemic.\nMore people have been put out of work in the last three weeks than in the two years of the last recession, with 16m jobs gone in the past three weeks, including more than 6.6m in the past seven days. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, unprecedented in the postwar era. The largest increases were in California (up 871,992), New York (up 286,596), Michigan (up 176,329) and Florida (up 154,171).\nDepression, not recession.

Manchester City are understood to be in talks with their squad over wage deferrals.\nSouthampton became the first Premier League club to reach an agreement over reduced pay with their players, who came to the consensus that wage deferrals were the fairest solution after holding talks with the board about the financial disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The club said their manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, senior coaching staff and board of directors would also defer some of their pay for the next three months.\nIt is understood Southampton\u2019s chief executive, Martin Semmens, played a leading role in the talks, coordinating a plan between the players and the club\u2019s owners, the Gao family and Katharina Liebherr.\nThe economic consequences of the suspension of English football were laid bare to the players and the agreement, believed to have the backing of the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, enables Southampton to commit to not furloughing staff until the end of June.\nIt represents a significant breakthrough in the pay dispute between top-flight players and owners since the postponement of the season. Although Premier League clubs could lose \u00a31.137bn if the season is cancelled, they have found it difficult to convince players to lower their pay.\nAttempts to reach an agreement over potential 30% reductions across the league reached a dead end last weekend, forcing clubs to go it alone. The PFA has stood in the way of sweeping cuts, arguing they would cause a \u00a3200m tax deficit and hurt the NHS.\nHowever, players are keen to contribute to society \u2013 it was announced on Wednesday that Premier League captains had launched a charitable fund, #PlayersTogether, to help people involved in tackling the pandemic \u2013 and they have also wanted clubs to make clear why wage drops are necessary.\nWest Ham have explained their financial situation to the players, who are discussing whether to defer pay. The captain, Mark Noble, will play a big role in representing the squad.\nWest Ham\u2019s manager, David Moyes, has taken a 30% pay cut and the club intend to raise at least \u00a330m through a rights issue next month. The vice-chair, Karren Brady, has also taken a 30% pay cut to ensure that full-time and casual staff continue to be paid in full.\nBrighton\u2019s chief executive, Paul Barber, said the club\u2019s financial situation had been set out to the players and he is hopeful they will assist by accepting a salary drop. \u201cWhat we have said is if we can take a cut on wages to reduce the loss of matchday income, that would be a significant help to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, on the other hand, at some stage in the future we recover that matchday income by playing those matches in front of a crowd, then we would simply return that money.\u201d\nBarber, the manager, Graham Potter, and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, have taken pay cuts. Barber said heating and lighting had been turned off at the training ground and stadium as a cost-cutting measure.\nThere are issues to resolve elsewhere. Bournemouth, Newcastle, Norwich and Tottenham have placed non-playing staff on furlough, and Crystal Palace are struggling to come to an agreement with their players about wage deferrals.\nWolves players and coaching staff have teamed up to make a six-figure donation to the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. The players have donated separately to #PlayersTogether. Wolves and their owner, Fosun, have already donated 6,300 pieces of protective equipment to the city\u2019s NHS and council.",
