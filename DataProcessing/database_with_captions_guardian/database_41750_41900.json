Why are there long queues outside jobcentres that are half closed because people can\u2019t get the forms they need to make a claim?\u2019 We have an online system. Thank heavens we do because it\u2019s working incredibly well.\u201d\nThe Labour MP Stephen McCabe suggested the department should consider deferring the loan repayments for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.\nThe committee heard that self-employed people with savings of \u00a316,000 would be eligible to claim for universal credit if they could show a portion of that money had been kept aside for paying future tax bills.\nMoney saved for tax would be classed as a business asset from now on and would not count as disposable income in a universal credit assessment, Quince said.\nPeople who have saved for house deposits and weddings have complained that they are being forced to use this money and do not qualify for any government assistance.\nThe minister said the principle remained that those with \u00a316,000 should be using it.\n\u201cThe fundamental principle is \u2026 the state is there to support those who need it and if you have over \u00a316,000 in savings you should be using that money to support yourself in difficult times,\u201d he said.",

The remainder of the payment was to be made when the whole order was completed, health sources said.\nBut insiders said the supplier was almost immediately hit with \u201can unexpected manufacturing delay\u201d, raising questions about whether the company had the ability to deliver on the shipment as promised.\nOn Wednesday the health minister Nadine Dorries said there had been problems finding reliable sources of supply, and she criticised Labour for publicising a list of potential PPE suppliers.\nThe minister wrote: \u201cLots of companies making contact \u2018I have 200 masks\u2019 but when you dig deeper they don\u2019t have any, they are just offering to act as agents and find some, for a commission.\u201d\nMore than 100 NHS workers have died from coronavirus, and repeated exposure to the sick has made them one of the most vulnerable groups.\nA succession of cabinet ministers promised the gowns would arrive imminently, starting with the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, who said at Saturday\u2019s daily press conference that the kit would arrive the following day.\nOn Wednesday night it emerged that the Department of Health had \u201cstrongly advised\u201d Downing Street and Jenrick not to mention the consignment, but faced with growing concern over PPE shortages for frontline staff he did so anyway.\nGavin Williamson, the education secretary, and Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, successively promised that the gowns would arrive on Monday, but they were delayed once again.\nInitially the delay in securing the order was blamed on the failure to obtain export licences for the kit, with some applications being made on Monday. But once the approvals had been obtained there was at first no kit to pick up.\nEventually a shipment did reach Istanbul airport on Tuesday and it was flown out overnight on an Atlas A400M transport aircraft. But it was far less than the 84-tonne consignment that had been expected.",

        "content": "A slow start, a top-down approach and long-term cuts to local services meant target was always going to be ambitious\nOn 2 April, the day he emerged from quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19, Matt Hancock stood at the Downing Street podium for the daily coronavirus press conference and made an announcement that was greeted in some quarters by a sharp intake of breath.\n\u201cI\u2019m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I\u2019m determined we\u2019ll get there,\u201d said the health secretary, who had tested positive around a week earlier.\nIt amazed many observers, but it wasn\u2019t the most ambitious testing target the government had put forward. On 25 March, under pressure on testing and claiming the UK was doing better than other countries, the prime minister said: \u201cWe are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day.\u201d\nBut even the lower numbers have never stacked up. With less than a week to go until his self-imposed deadline, and in spite of buoyant talk by ministers and advisers, many believe that the 100,000 target to which Hancock so firmly committed himself will also be missed.\nA massive effort to set up big new laboratories and engage smaller ones, the \u201clittle ships\u201d, to help, along with a plan for 50 drive-through centres, has increased capacity. But with a week to go, the UK finds itself with capacity for 40,000 tests a day \u2013 and only half that number being carried out. It is well short of the pledge and, more importantly, if the intention is for the UK to test its way out of lockdown, it is not enough.\nIf the target is missed, there is a risk that blame may be deflected on to the tens of thousands of health workers and key workers themselves. Hancock has already said that they are not turning up at the drive-through centres in the numbers expected. But in fact nurses and doctors have ended up self-isolating because of the long distances they would have to drive to get tested \u2013 and there have been stories of some being turned away when they get there.\nAnd as strategists and politicians start to map out the exit from lockdown, the question of resources for local public health teams that have been stripped back over a decade of austerity will become increasingly urgent. The regular \u2013 perhaps weekly \u2013 testing of those on the frontline and tracking down contacts has to be done locally. It cannot be run, as so much of the epidemic response has been, from Westminster.\nBut to understand how that pledge has begun to seem so out of reach, it is essential to look at how the government\u2019s approach to it began: slowly. The UK started ramping up testing too late, having abandoned it as a core principle on 12 March, when Johnson declared the virus could no longer be contained. People with symptoms should just stay at home, he said. Only hospital patients would be tested. Thus Britain went to the back of the queue for testing kits, reagents and other commodities that the world was scrambling for.\nTesting, followed by contact tracing and quarantine, is the standard public health response to an infectious disease epidemic, supported loudly by the World Health Organization, whose director general said it should be \u201cthe backbone of the response in every country\u201d. The UK had other ideas, but as the numbers admitted to hospital rose and NHS staff began to stay at home because they or their family fell ill, the calls for testing became more vocal.\nPromises began to be made. In an odd disconnect, NHS and Public Health England had said they intended to reach 10,000 tests a day on 11 March, the day before Johnson declared the containment phase over and said people with symptoms should stay home untested. Just 1,215 people had been tested by that stage.\nThe issue got hotter. On 18 March, Johnson declared the UK would do 25,000 tests a day, but did not say when. On 29 March, Hancock tweeted that they had reached the 10,000 target and were on course for 25,000. The watchdog organisation Full Fact, however, later said the data did not support the claim. The highest number tested in a day in England at that time had been 9,114.\nOn 2 April, Hancock made the pledge that threatens to \u201ccome back and bite him\u201d, according to the Telegraph this week, citing \u201ca No 10 insider\u201d. They would do 25,000 tests a day by mid- to late April, and 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.\nWith the prime minister in isolation in Downing Street with symptoms, and a need to quash difficult questions about why the UK lagged behind, the health secretary made some admissions.\nUnlike Germany, the UK did not have a huge diagnostics industry, he said, so had been \u201ccatching up\u201d. He acknowledged that global demand had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents. The swabs issue had been fixed but \u201cwe are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge\u201d, he said.\nIn a rare moment, he admitted that the government had not got everything right: \u201cThere will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.\u201d But he also had a reassuringly substantial-sounding plan for what was next, from bringing in commercial partners to scaling up Britain\u2019s diagnostic capacity: the \u201cfive pillars\u201d.\nHowever many pillars there were, 100,000 tests a day was such a big number that it was assumed the government was including antibody tests to demonstrate people had been infected in the past, as well as the PCR swab tests for people with symptoms.\nThe government had been enthusiastic about the possibility of a fingerprick antibody test that anyone could do at home, like a pregnancy test. Johnson on 19 March said: \u201cTo give you an idea of what is coming down the track, we\u2019re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test, as simple as a pregnancy test, which can tell whether you have had the disease. It\u2019s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game-changer.\u201d\nPublic Health England\u2019s director of infections, Prof Sharon Peacock, elaborated on 25 March, telling the science and technology committee of MPs that a simple home test would be available within days.\nBut it wasn\u2019t to be. Oxford University scientists have been evaluating some of the 3.5m antibody tests Hancock bought from a number of companies. He had placed orders for a further 17.5m. The best of them are 70% accurate. Most are only right half the time. Having previously claimed that it had struck deals which meant no payment would be made until the tests were proven, the government is now trying to get its money back.\nSo the 100,000 tests are PCR swab tests for current viral infection only, and all the stops have been pulled out to get there. On Wednesday, the Department for Health and Social Care hailed the \u201cbiggest network of diagnostic labs in British history\u201d, built in five weeks flat. Three mega-labs would process samples from 27 of the planned 50 drive-through centres. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies were lending equipment. The UK\u2019s two biggest drug companies, Astra Zeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, are collaborating on a fourth lab in Cambridge.\nAnd yet, only half the daily 40,000 test capacity is being used. Hancock talked of lower than expected demand and has opened the scheme to other key workers outside the NHS, including social care workers, police, prison officers, social workers and benefits staff.\nBut there is a fundamental problem. Key workers don\u2019t want a long drive at the end of a gruelling shift to get tested.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from the frontline is that nurses are driving up to two hours, feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus, to testing stations, and sometimes if you haven\u2019t got an appointment you\u2019re turned away and told to come back another time,\u201d Dame Donna Kinnair, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, told the health and social care select committee.\nThe British Medical association estimated on Wednesday that nearly 100,000 health workers were self-isolating because the testing sites were not easy to get to.\nProf John Ashton, former regional director of public health for north-west England, said the government\u2019s battle plan against Covid-19 had been so centralised and top-down that they hadn\u2019t asked people what would work for them in their locality.\n\u201cYou have to go to them. They should be testing them as they leave work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same issue with immunisation.\u201d Offering nurses flu jabs in the hospital as they arrive or go home has successfully raised rates in the past.\nImportantly, testing is not an end in itself. When the UK attempts to lift the lockdown, testing, tracing the contacts of anyone who is positive and ensuring they isolate themselves is essential. Key workers running higher risks may have to be tested weekly. That needs to be run locally, by people who understand the community they live and work in.\nBut regional public health teams have been decimated. Local authorities were given responsibility for public health in the Andrew Lansley reforms. Cash-strapped town halls have raided the public health budgets, which are down by at least 30%. Public health teams \u201care a shadow of what they were\u201d, said Ashton.\nIn the 1970s, Liverpool had 6,000 public health staff, including community nurses, health visitors, food hygiene staff and many others. \u201cNow they\u2019d be lucky to have 30 or 40 staff,\u201d he said. \u201cBolton has got four in its public health team.\u201d\nThe epidemic will not behave in the same way in every part of Britain. Once out of UK-wide lockdown, cases will flare in one region or another, and the best firefighters will be local public health teams. These are people who know their communities. It is the local teams, says Ashton, who could have made the next chapter less disastrous than the current one.\n\u201cThey are the ones that should be leading on contact tracing and testing programmes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can\u2019t be done from Whitehall.\u201d The problem is, in many cases, they barely exist.",

        "content": "Lower pollution levels must persist after lockdown says capital\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan\nLondon has had dramatic improvements in its air quality since the coronavirus lockdown, with dangerous emissions at some of the capital\u2019s busiest roads and junctions falling by almost 50%.\nFigures released by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, show that anti-pollution measures introduced from 2017 had already led to a 35% drop across the capital of the harmful gas nitrogen dioxide, NO2 \u2013 rising to a 44% reduction inside central London\u2019s ultra-low emissions zone (ULEZ).\nIn the last four weeks of lockdown there have been further big reductions, with NO2 falling by a further 27% across London, and by almost half at some of the worst pollution hotspots.\nKhan welcomed the decline in toxic air, but said that once the lockdown was over it was essential that the efforts to improve London\u2019s toxic air continued.\n\u201cThis cleaner air should not just be temporary. So once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover, our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we\u2019ve made through policies such as ULEZ continue.\u201d\nAlthough the figures show a big reduction in NO2, particulate pollution, which comes largely from domestic wood burning and agriculture, and which is very harmful to human health, remains a severe threat in London.\nElizabeth Fonseca, an air quality expert at the Environmental Defence Fund Europe, said that long-term cleaner air was essential to protect people\u2019s health.\n\u201cNitrogen dioxide pollution has gone down, but London recently saw huge spikes in dangerous particulate pollution. A few weeks\u2019 or months\u2019 improvement of just one pollutant doesn\u2019t make lung disease and other ailments disappear.\u201d\nThere is mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts of air pollution, through lung disease, heart attacks, asthma, effects on pregnancies and on intelligence levels.\nResearch published on Monday also found that the five most polluted regions among 66 analysed in Italy, Spain, France and Germany accounted for 78% of all reported Covid-19 deaths in those areas.\nAnother study looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with far higher Covid-19 death rates.\nIn the UK NO2 has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last 10 years. A key policy to reduce levels involves clean air zones \u2013 such as the ultra-low emissions zone in London \u2013 where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres.\nBut the coronavirus crisis has seen some councils delay the planned introduction of clean air zones.\nMany cities across Europe, and some in the UK, have begun to unveil ambitious cycling and walking schemes to ensure people can move around safely and maintain the environmental benefits, in terms of cleaner air and safer streets, that have come about amid the lockdown.\nGary Fuller, an air pollution expert at King\u2019s College London, welcomed Thursday\u2019s figures and said the policies introduced in London and elsewhere proved air pollution could be tackled.\nHe said: \u201cBreathing bad air has had an intolerable impact of Londoners\u2019 health for far too long \u2026 but even before the Covid lockdown, London\u2019s air pollution was undergoing a dramatic change for the better.\n\u201cNitrogen dioxide in central London and along main bus routes was improving at some of the fastest rates we\u2019ve ever measured. We need to remember these lessons going forward. These successes show that our city\u2019s air pollution is not an intractable problem and that actions can bring results.\u201d\nProf Stephen Holgate, an adviser on air quality at the Royal College of Physicians, said that although Covid-19 had wreaked havoc, the \u201cdreadful virus has brought the importance of outdoor space and the environment into focus\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re all looking forward to the time when the lockdown is lifted, and once it does I sincerely hope we\u2019ll be able to retain some of the new cleaner and greener habits we\u2019ve developed.\u201d",

The top line remains a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d to finish the season, and even suggests a preference for adopting a different format, such as a play-off, before cancelling. But as the coronavirus crisis deepens there is an acceptance that national competitions \u2013 with Scotland and the Netherlands foremost among them \u2013 are facing extraordinary circumstances.\nUefa has laid out two primary conditions under which it would accept the abandonment of a league. The first would involve being instructed to do so by a government, which is the case in the Netherlands; the second is \u201cinsurmountable economic problems\u201d. Uefa\u2019s announcement cites a request from Scottish football authorities for clarity on the rules. The Scottish Premiership is now expected to bring its season to an end.\nIn a statement Uefa said: \u201cThe ideal scenario, should the pandemic situation permit it, is to have the currently suspended domestic competitions completed ... in their original format. Should this outcome not be possible, it would be preferable that suspended domestic competitions would restart with a different format in a manner which would still facilitate clubs to qualify on sporting merit.\u201d\nThe statement goes on, however: \u201cWhile using best efforts to complete the domestic competitions, national associations and/or leagues might have legitimate reasons to prematurely terminate their domestic competitions.\u201d\nUefa then requests that, if terminated leagues are to submit clubs to European competition in the 2021-22 season, they do so \u201cbased on sporting merit\u201d, determining final placings \u201con objective, transparent and non-discriminatory principles\u201d. While leaving open some flexibility, the recommendation would seem to encourage a solution where an incomplete league table is organised on a points-per-game basis.\nUefa says it reserves the right to refuse nations or clubs to compete in the Champions League and Europa League if these criteria have not been met. It stipulates a further reason for termination that may be acceptable; namely if it has been done on \u201cthe basis of any other legitimate public health reasons\u201d.\nThis final clause will be interpreted by some as leaving open the possibility for even the biggest leagues to stop their seasons should the pandemic not allow a safe resumption of competition.\nUefa also announced it would be advancing \u20ac70m (\u00a361.2m) from its \u201cnational team competition revenues\u201d to clubs which released players for the European qualifiers and the Nations League. It was also confirmed that the men\u2019s European Championship will retain the name Euro 2020 despite having been rescheduled for the following year.",

        "content": "Carmakers announce new safety measures, as B&Q reopens sites and Taylor Wimpey plans to resume work\nMajor names in British car manufacturing, construction and retail have announced plans to return to work in tentative signs that businesses are preparing to kickstart an economy paralysed by the coronavirus pandemic.\nCarmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin joined Taylor Wimpey in announcing they would restart work with social distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The DIY retailer B&Q opened 80 sites on Thursday, taking its total this week to 155 as it rolled back the blanket closure of its estate last month.\nVast numbers of companies across the UK have stopped operations during the pandemic, but with no end in sight for physical distancing rules, companies have been forced to consider new ways of working.\nJaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s biggest carmaker, plans to gradually reopen some factories on 18 May. The company\u2019s Solihull plant, which employs 9,000 workers making its Range Rover models, will reopen with a quarter of its workers at first, alongside SUV plants in Slovakia and Austria. This month Vauxhall said it was ready to reopen its Ellesmere Port site on the Wirral after setting out socially distanced production lines, break areas and restrooms.\n\u201cWe are developing robust protocol and guidelines to support a safe return to work,\u201d said JLR. \u201cWe will adopt strict social distancing measures across our business and are currently evaluating a number of different measures to ensure we protect and reassure our workforce when they begin to return to work.\u201d\nAston Martin Lagonda said it would reopen its factory in St Athan, south Wales, on 5 May with new safety measures similar to those planned by Vauxhall. The carmaker hopes to ramp up production of its new sports utility vehicle, the DBX. The new car is crucial to reviving the fortunes of the company, recently bailed out by a consortium led by a billionaire investor.\nIts chief executive, Andy Palmer, and board members also said they would take a voluntary 35% pay cut. The pay of other executives at the company will fall by 20%, in line with the reduction for workers furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme.\nB&Q has gradually reopened just over half its stores this week and could open more next week after introducing a number of safety measures.\nThe DIY chain is classed as an essential retailer under the government\u2019s high street lockdown rules but nevertheless closed stores last month. However, it has now reopened 155 outlets, following the example of supermarkets by limiting the number of customers in stores at any one time, switching to card-only payments and installing perspex screens at checkouts to shield staff.\n\u201cHaving watched other essential retailers support social distancing in their stores, we are now following their best practice and are re-opening some stores with strict social distancing measures in place,\u201d said a B&Q spokesperson.\nSupermarkets, deemed essential retailers by the government, have stayed open with measures including 2-metre markers on shop floors and protective screens for checkout staff.\nTaylor Wimpey and Vistry, formerly known as Bovis, also announced plans on Thursday to start building again. Vistry said it would resume building homes on Monday, while the first Taylor Wimpey workers will return on 4 May.\nWhile Taylor Wimpey has drawn up a Covid-19 code of conduct to which all staff, subcontractors and suppliers have to sign up, many construction workers have taken to social media to complain of unsafe working conditions. They say the 2-metre physical distancing rule is almost impossible to adhere to on building sites and in work canteens.\nTo try to allay these concerns, Taylor Wimpey said it had designed and started manufacturing a bespoke face shield, which will attach to a construction hard hat and will be used on all its sites for two-person tasks.\nPete Redfern, Taylor Wimpey\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are now confident that we have clear plans and processes in place so we can safely start back on site in a phased way beginning on 4 May.\u201d\nThe construction firm Mace started reopening some of its 90 sites in early April after a two-week shutdown, and the French firm Bouygues said earlier this week that it would restart construction in the UK \u201cprogressively\u201d.",

        "content": "Don\u2019t look now, but Suzanne Collins\u2019 novel about the early years of Donald Sutherland\u2019s character Coriolanus Snow is heading for the big screen\nThe Hunger Games movies represented a perfect storm for studio Lionsgate in the early part of the last decade. Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s star status, combined with the remarkable popularity of young adult science fiction, meant those annual trips to the dystopian future nation of Panem stacked up more box-office gold than you might have found in the gilded Capitol\u2019s brimming bank vaults. Lawrence carried the four movies in the bloodthirsty yet weirdly splatter-free saga virtually singlehanded: it\u2019s impossible not to flash back to Katniss Everdeen\u2019s anguished features when recalling the actor\u2019s rise to Hollywood fame and fortune.\n  In the wake of the final (somewhat disappointing) brace of films, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2, there were reports that prequels were being considered. At the time, Lawrence dismissed the idea, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon. They\u2019ve got to let the body get cold, in my opinion.\u201d \n  Does five years count as long enough? The Hollywood Reporter confirmed this week that Lionsgate will adapt Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins\u2019s forthcoming novel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snake, which takes place decades before the events of the original trilogy, for the big screen. Centre-stage this time will be a young Coriolanus Snow, the future president of Panem as portrayed so memorably by Donald Sutherland in the earlier films.\nHe won\u2019t be volunteering as tribute, however, so forget the prospect of seeing those supercilious, snooty expressions pleasingly wiped from his face by an axe-wielding opponent or storm of mutant bees. In the book, 18-year-old Snow finds himself with a chance to revive the fortunes of his once proud aristocratic house when he is handed the role of mentor to one of the participants in the 10th annual Hunger Games. He is naturally devastated when it turns out he will be partnering a young woman from impoverished District 12, giving him little or no chance of victory. (You can hear Collins reading the first chapter here).\n  And so the stage is set for the new episode to offer an insight into the older Snow\u2019s antipathy towards Everdeen, who also came from District 12. But will this be enough to lure in audiences? There are echoes here of the Star Wars movies, which also delivered prequel episodes centred on the back story of a major villain. But are we really quite so fascinated with Snow\u2019s origins as fans of the original trilogy were when it was announced that George Lucas planned a new triptych telling the story of the fall of Darth Vader? \n  As Lucas discovered, the problem with focusing on a figure whom everybody knows is going to end up as the bad guy is that you have to try extra hard to deliver a character that sparkles. The young Snow will need to fascinate audiences to the extent that we forget all about his snakelike future misdeeds. Casting will be key.\n  Part of the issue with the Hunger Games movies was that they became less interesting the more we learned about Panem, its big players and the political machinations. The early, arena-focused movies worked well in a Battle Royale-lite fashion, but a new episode that delves further into Capitol high society doesn\u2019t summon confidence in quite the same way. And, this being a movie based on a young adult novel, there is guaranteed to be romantic tension between Snow and his new mentee. Given the tedious nature of the previous trilogy\u2019s love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and the almost completely anonymous Gale, that doesn\u2019t bode well, either.\n  The more I think about this, the less I can imagine why anyone would be desperate to read Collins\u2019s new novel, let alone go to see a movie based on it. Then again, perhaps Lionsgate could build some hype by stealing another Star Wars trick: surely we would all flock to see this flick if the studio used mo-cap ghosting tech to bring back Sutherland as a younger version of himself, sashaying back on to the scene with ginger mane and angular features restored to those of his prime. Perhaps Julie Christie could play the new Katniss \u2026",

        "content": "Prolific mathematician known for the Game of Life whose inventions ranged from the surreal numbers to the Doomsday Rule\nJohn Horton Conway, who has died aged 82 after contracting Covid-19, was one of the most prolific and charismatic British mathematicians of the 20th century. He was active in many branches of mathematics, including group theory, coding theory, knot theory, geometry, number theory and quadratic forms, as well as in recreational mathematics.\nAn iconoclastic academic, he held court for over half a century in mathematics departments worldwide, notably at Cambridge and Princeton universities. Although he thought it one of his lesser accomplishments, John is best known for his late 1960s invention of the Game of Life. It is an \u201corganic life\u201d simulation carried out on a square grid of cells, each of which is alive or dead according to how many living neighbours it has. Despite the simplicity of John\u2019s defining rules, it turned out that anything that can be algorithmically computed can be done so within the zero-player Game of Life. While John\u2019s approach was done with pen and paper, the game was a catalyst for computer programmers in the 70s and is now viewed as a watershed development in the field of cellular automata.\nJohn, together with Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard Guy, is credited with co-founding the field of combinatorial game theory. That is the mathematical analysis of games such as noughts and crosses, draughts, chess and Go, as well as a wealth of original games that John and assorted collaborators devised over the decades, such as Phutball (short for Philosopher\u2019s Football), a two-person board game played on a grid using one white stone (the ball) and numerous black stones (representing men), Hackenbush, and Sprouts. This led to a joint book, Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays (1982).\nIn the early 70s, John came up with the definitive refinement of what is now known as the Monster Group. Groups arise from the study of symmetry of objects in mathematics and in nature. For instance, the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle has six things in it: three rotations and three flips. There are standard \u201catomic building blocks\u201d of all finite groups of symmetries, which are well understood, and 26 strange additional ones, called sporadic groups, of which the Monster Group, predicted independently by two mathematicians, Bernd Fischer and Bob Griess, is the largest. In 1973 Griess finally constructed the Monster itself, and John then came up with a simpler construction. This group has 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000 symmetries in it. That is vast beyond comprehension, and about 1,000 times the current estimate for the number of atoms in the Earth.\nA few years later, John went further. Along with his former PhD student Simon Norton, he came up with the Monstrous Moonshine conjecture, connecting group theory with the seemingly unrelated study of modular forms. Another of John\u2019s former students, Richard Borcherds, got a Fields medal (one of the two highest honours in mathematics) in 1998 for his successful proof of the conjecture.\nJohn often said that his proudest invention was the surreal numbers, a unifying number system that he conceived in the late 60s, which encompassed ordinary numbers as well as those that are infinitely small or large. He was also particularly pleased with the free will theorem in quantum mechanics from early in the current century, which he formulated with Simon Kochen. In his own words, it says that \u201cif experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles\u201d.\nJohn was a prodigious mental calculator too. He delighted in being challenged to shout out the day of the week for any randomly chosen date in history, which he could do using his own so-called Doomsday Rule; his methods were adapted and streamlined from Lewis Carroll\u2019s 1887 algorithm. He attributed his success in so many different arenas to his habit of always working simultaneously on several unrelated problems: he might be stuck on most of them but suddenly have an idea leading to a breakthrough on another one.\nWhile many of John\u2019s creations were the products of his own fertile mind, he thrived on collaboration. His best known book, the Atlas of Finite Groups (1985), was co-authored by Norton, Robert Curtis, Richard Parker and Robert Wilson. Around 1976, he helped Roger Penrose refine the analysis of what we now know as Penrose tiles, and he came up with the catchy terms kite and dart for the two basic shapes from which they are made.\nJohn left his mark on the groundbreaking book series The Art of Computer Programming. The computer scientist and author of that work, Donald Knuth, who also wrote a book about Conway\u2019s surreal numbers, said: \u201cAlthough John was a pure mathematician, he covered so many bases that I\u2019ve cited him more than 25 times (so far) for different contributions to The Art of Computer Programming.\u201d\nThe American writer Martin Gardner helped to popularise much of John\u2019s output in his Scientific American columns, going back to the late 50s. A decade ago, John worked with the editor Peter Renz on updated versions of some of Gardner\u2019s books of collected columns, again contributing fresh results of significance, including a new proof of Morley\u2019s theorem about triangles. \u201cAnyone who has sat with John has been touched, changed for ever,\u201d said Renz. \u201cHe had a way of refining things to their purest forms.\u201d\nBorn in Liverpool, John was the son of Agnes (n\u00e9e Boyce) and Cyril Horton Conway, a chemistry lab technician at the Liverpool Institute high school for boys. John got his secondary education at the Holt high school for boys, Childwall, then went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, gaining his BA in 1959. A PhD (1964) followed, under Harold Davenport.\nHe became an assistant lecturer at Cambridge, later rising to be professor of mathematics. In 1987 he took up the position of John von Neumann professor of applied and computational mathematics at Princeton University, New Jersey.\nWhile he was reportedly shy as a young man, over time John developed a disarming charm and an extrovert Pied Piper persona. He earned a reputation for delivering one brilliant lecture after another, and his classes at both Cambridge and Princeton were invariably oversubscribed. His infectious enthusiasm turned on generations of young people to the joy of research mathematics.\nHis biographer, Siobhan Roberts, dubbed him \u201cthe world\u2019s most lovable egomaniac\u201d, adding, \u201cHe is Archimedes, Mick Jagger, Salvador Dal\u00ed and Richard Feynman, all rolled into one.\u201d\nJohn was elected FRS, a fellow of the Royal Society, in 1981 \u2013 following which he told people he was now officially a Filthy Rotten Swine \u2013 and was the first recipient of the London Mathematical Society\u2019s P\u00f3lya prize in 1987. He was awarded the Nemmers prize in mathematics (1998), the Leroy P Steele prize for mathematical exposition (2000), and the Joseph Priestley award (2001-02), and received honorary doctorates from the University of Liverpool (2001) and Jacobs University, Bremen (2015). He retired in 2013, when he became emeritus professor at Princeton.\nIn a 2014 video for the online channel Numberphile, John discussed getting over his feelings of inadequacy in his 20s, facing mortality in his 70s, and his lingering mathematical wish to really understand why the extraordinarily large Monster Group exists.\nHis first two marriages, to Eileen Howe and Larissa Queen, ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Diana (nee Cutsogeorge), whom he married in 2001, and their son, Gareth; four daughters, Susie, Rosie, Ellie and Annie, from his first marriage; two sons, Alex and Oliver, from his second marriage; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.\n John Horton Conway, mathematician, born 26 December 1937; died 11 April 2020\n This article was amended on 29 April 2020.

        "content": "Scottish government planning for cycle of lockdowns being lifted and reimposed\nScotland must establish a new normal of \u201cliving alongside\u201d coronavirus, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as the Scottish government published its plan for moving beyond current restrictions, presenting a future cycle of lockdown being lifted and then reimposed \u201cwith little notice\u201d, potentially until a vaccine has been found.\nAnnouncing daily data indicating a continuing drop in hospital admissions and intensive care cases, Sturgeon on Thursday urged the Scottish public to read and respond to the 26-page document, which stresses that Scotland may break with the current \u201cfour nations approach\u201d if expert advice recommends this.\nWithin five hours of being posted online, the PDF of the document had been accessed 170,000 times, the Scottish government later confirmed.\nThe document places testing, tracing and isolation at the heart of the continuing strategy, and emphasises the need for innovative approaches to continued physical distancing as well as \u201cunprecedented\u201d public compliance.\nIt states: \u201cIf, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus, then we will have to reimpose them, possibly returning to lockdown with little notice. While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.\u201d\nSturgeon said the lifting of the lockdown was not \u201ca flick of a switch\u201d, and physical distancing and limited contact with others was likely to continue \u201cfor the rest of the year and maybe beyond\u201d.\nShe said group gatherings, for example in pubs or at public events, were likely to be banned or restricted for some months to come, and some form of shielding would be required for the foreseeable future as well as \u201cstronger surveillance for those coming into the country\u201d.\nThe first minister also raised the prospect of redesigning workplaces and schools to allow people to remain two metres apart, with the possibility of some groups of pupils returning before others or on different days of the week.\nAsked whether these long-term restrictions were likely to affect family Christmas celebrations, Sturgeon said: \u201cI\u2019m not cancelling Christmas. Christmas is still a quite a long way away \u2013 I know it comes round quicker every year. It may happen slightly differently depending on where we are, but we will take these things in a calm, considered way.\u201d\nThe document says the Scottish government will assess easing restrictions for specific geographies and sectors, for example parts of the rural economy. This would happen only if it did not undermine the \u201csimplicity of the message\u201d, Sturgeon said.\nIt likewise drives home the importance of stabilising below 1.0 the virus\u2019s reproduction number (R0), which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates, and ensuring that the impact of any easing of restrictions did not raise the number above that figure.\nSturgeon said when the lockdown began, Scotland\u2019s R0 was above 3, while the best estimates suggested it was now between 0.6 to 1. She said the continuing uncertainty over the infection rate was part of the reason why she was not lifting restrictions immediately.\nScotland\u2019s interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, also would not specify an exact figure he wanted to see the number stabilise at, saying that in principle it should be \u201cas low as possible\u201d.\nThe document also raises the prospect of using digital tools to assist contact tracing, and while it does not directly refer to the controversial approach of \u201cherd immunity\u201d, it says there is no such thing as \u201cacceptable loss\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are clear that an assumption that there is a proportion or section of the population that it is safe or acceptable to allow to be infected forms no part of the Scottish government\u2019s policy or approach.\u201d\nWhile the document is clear that Scotland could take a different path from the rest of the UK if the science requires it, Sturgeon said: \u201cMost of what I\u2019m talking about today I want to do on a UK-wide basis as far as it makes sense, but I have a responsibility as first minster to use the powers I have in a way that is right for Scotland.\u201d\nNo 10 said there was no indication so far that the four nation approach was crumbling. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, the Scottish government have stressed they want to continue to operate within the four nations UK framework and align any decisions which are taken as far as possible. That is obviously the approach of ourselves.\u201d\nThe Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, said any divergence from the four nations strategy on ending the lockdown would require compelling evidence, \u201cin the interests of ensuring clear and consistent advice to the public\u201d.\nIn contrast, the Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie said he welcomed the \u201crecognition that a one-size-fits-all exit strategy for the UK was inappropriate\u201d, but he said far more detail was needed on plans for an effective testing, tracing and isolation strategy, \u201cespecially when Scotland is not using the testing capacity it currently has\u201d.",

He said what had started as a public health emergency was rapidly turning into a human rights crisis.\nGovernment responses to the crisis have been regarded as disproportionate in countries including China, India, Hungary, Turkey and South Africa.\nGuterres has already called for a global ceasefire, and has warned of a growth in domestic violence as a result of the virus, but the UN collectively has been criticised for failing to have an impact in the crisis.\n#COVID19 is a public health emergency \u2014 that is fast becoming a human rights crisis.People \u2014 and their rights \u2014 must be front and centre.My new report on how human rights can and must guide #coronavirus response & recovery: https://t.co/CmYirKbsci pic.twitter.com/rssMV0MPBg\nIn his latest intervention, he warned \u201cthe virus is having a disproportionate impact on certain communities through the rise of hate speech, the targeting of vulnerable groups, and the risks of heavy handed security responses undermining the health response\u201d.\nIn its new report on Covid-19 and human rights, the UN highlighted the use of phrases such as \u201cforeigner\u2019s disease\u201d to describe the virus, saying such remarks can lead to discrimination, xenophobia, racism and attacks.\nReleasing the report, Guterres called for any states of emergency to be proportionate and time limited, with a specific focus and duration.\nFreedom of movement needed to be curtailed, he accepted, but he said the scale of such restrictions can be reduced by effective testing and targeted quarantine measures. He reported more than 131 countries have closed their borders, with only 30 allowing exemptions for asylum seekers.\nThousands, the UN said in its briefing paper, \u201chave been pushed back or deported to dangerous environments since the crisis began. Refugees, IDPs [internally displaced persons] and migrants live in overcrowded conditions with unlimited access to sanitation and healthcare\u201d.\nThe UN pointed out that sometimes under the pretext of fake news, journalists, doctors, healthcare workers and activists or political opposition were being arrested. Online surveillance and aggressive cyber policy were on the increase. \u201cSweeping efforts to eliminate misinformation or disinformation can result in purposeful or unintentional censorship that underpins trust,\u201d it said.\nThe best solution, Guterres said, was for governments to be open and transparent about their efforts to constrain the virus, including by allowing their opposition or civil society groups to scrutinise the executive online.\nAlthough the UN acknowledged new technologies can help the fight against the virus, including by analysing its spread, \u201cthe use of artificial intelligence and big data to enforce emergency measures or to track impacted populations raise concerns,\u201d he warned.\nThe UN\u2019s report further notes that \u201cthe potential for abuse is high: what is justified during an emergency now may become normalised once the crisis has passed.\n\u201cWithout adequate safeguards, these powerful technologies may cause discrimination, be intrusive and infringe on privacy, or may be deployed against people or groups for purposes going far beyond the pandemic response.\u201d",

Most parts of the network are operating Sunday levels of service throughout the week.\nHowever, with the rail industry requiring four weeks\u2019 notice to amend schedules, preparations are starting for a potential Saturday-style service, roughly 80% of weekday timetables.\nThe government and operators are understood to be aiming to be ready to add capacity as early as 18 May. The summer timetable was due to come into effect on this date, requiring changed rosters and route training, regardless of any lifting of coronavirus restrictions.\nSome operators are uneasy about a swift restoration of services. One source said trains could be no more than 20% full with social distancing rules. \u201cThe industry will take a hit if this is not well managed and too many passengers are onboard.

        "content": "Recession and unprecedented squeeze on incomes likely, says Bank of England policymaker\nThe UK\u2019s manufacturing and services industries suffered the biggest slump on record this month, according to figures released on Thursday, as a Bank of England policymaker warned Britain\u2019s economy was on course to suffer the deepest recession in several hundred years.\nGertjan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, said the UK was heading for a squeeze on incomes that was unprecedented in its speed and severity.\nIn a health check of the UK economy ahead of the monetary policy committee\u2019s next meeting in May, he said: \u201cBased on the early indicators, and based on the experience in other countries that were hit somewhat earlier than the UK, it seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries.\u201d\nBritain is expected to enter a recession in the first half of the year after large parts of the economy were forced to shut and workers stay at home as part of efforts to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.\nData firm IHS Markit said its UK composite purchasing managers index (PMI), which tracks activity across the services and manufacturing sectors, slumped to just 12.9 for April, down from 36 in March and a record since the survey began in the 90s. This was far below economists\u2019 forecasts and well short of the 38.1 reading recorded in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. A PMI figure above 50 indicates an expansion of business activity.\nAmid warnings that tackling the pandemic could wreck developed and developing world economies for several years, IHS Markit said the dive in activity in the UK and the eurozone was the worst since it started surveying businesses more than two decades ago.\nManufacturing and services companies reported a collapse in business, with the manufacturing PMI falling from 43.9 in March to 16.6 in April and the services PMI tumbling from 34.5 in March to 12.3 in April. The services sector accounts for about three-quarters of the UK\u2019s business activity.\nIHS Markit said 80% of the UK service companies it surveyed reported a drop in activity this month, as did 75% of manufacturers.\nThis was \u201coverwhelmingly attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d, the data provider said.\nMany firms also reported record declines in new orders and backlogs of work and employment. Half of those surveyed said they had cut their workforce this month, with many saying they had furloughed staff.\nA survey of manufacturers by the business lobby group the CBI documented the same slide in business activity over the last quarter coupled an outlook with the fastest reduction in jobs since 1980 over the next quarter.\nThe CBI said nearly half of businesses surveyed were expecting output to be limited by shortages of materials or components \u2013 the highest proportion since 1975.\nThe eurozone also suffered the steepest fall in business activity and employment ever recorded, ahead of what is expected to be the deepest global recession in peacetime. The eurozone-wide composite PMI hit an all-time low of 13.5 in April, down from a prior record low of 29.7 in March, reflecting the wholesale shutdown of Europe\u2019s economy this month.\nChris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said that based on responses from business, the UK economy was likely to contract by 7% this year while the eurozone economy could fall by 7.5%.\nHe said: \u201cThe level of business closures and social distancing measures have caused business activity to collapse at a rate vastly exceeding that seen even during the global financial crisis, confirming fears that GDP will slump to a degree previously thought unimaginable in the second quarter due to measures taken to contain the spread of the virus.\u201d\nFor the UK, he said the situation could be even worse as elements of business activity excluded from the survey fall at a faster rate.\n\u201cThe actual decline in GDP could be even greater, in part because the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail sector, which have been especially hard-hit by the Covid-19 containment measures.\u201d\nHe said there was \u201cone ray of light\u201d, which came from an improvement in business optimism about the year ahead, compared with the all-time low recorded in March.\n\u201cSentiment about the coming year nevertheless remained the second-lowest ever recorded to underscore how few businesses are anticipating a swift recovery,\u201d he said.",

After losing a marathon 204-game one-minute bullet match to 16-year-old Alireza Firouzja and then suffering another reversal to the teen, 7.5-8.5 in the Banter Blitz Cup, Magnus Carlsen defeated the prodigy 2.5-1.5 on the most important occasion, the $250,000 Carlsen Invitational.\nThe Norwegian, 29, knew that a third setback would be a blemish on his career record and would boost the growing reputation of his young opponent, so he treated the occasion as seriously as a global title match.\n\u201cI wanted to crush him\u201d said Carlsen afterwards, using the c-word which was also a favourite of the legendary crushers Bobby Fischer and Judit Polgar. The champion dominated the play and showed a higher level of understanding in the first three games.\nThe score could easily have been 3.5-0.5 but for Carlsen\u2019s self-induced blunder in game two, where he provoked a standard tactic which allowed Firouzja a queen sacrifice for checkmate. Afterwards Carlsen was scathing about his own play which he called \u201cunforgivable\u201d and \u201cterribly bad\u201d while describing Firouzja as \u201cvery slippery\u201d.\nCarlsen continued in good form by defeating his old rival, America\u2019s world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, by 3-1 including this impressive attack.\nIn contrast, Firouzja\u2019s tournament has turned into a nightmare. After losing to Carlsen and to the world No 3, Ding Liren, he was disconnected from the internet in a favourable position against the US champion, Hikaru Nakamura. Both were down to their last minute.\nThe relevant rule stated: \u201cIn case a player is disconnected from the playing server at no fault of his own, the game shall be resumed from the current position as soon as possible. The clock times will be adjusted accordingly, based on the information provided by the playing server. The chief arbiter may decide otherwise in exceptional circumstances.\u201d\nNakamura, believing he had won, left the room for a 10-minute break, which was time enough for both players to analyse the position with an engine. The chief arbiter decided these were exceptional circumstances and ruled the game a draw. When Firouzja protested the appeals committee upheld the original decision .\nThe teen, who had also lost a controversial rules decision against Carlsen at the world blitz in December, was demoralised. He was beaten in all his remaining three games against Nakamura, losing game three by a mouse slip in a drawn ending before collapsing in 14 moves in the final game. Carlsen won again in Friday\u2019s fourth round, defeating France\u2019s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 2.5-1.5 while Firouzja lost 1-3 to Caruana and is now almost sure to be eliminated from the semi-finals which start on 1 May.\nFide, the global chess body, has announced a new online event, the Nations Cup, with four-player teams from China, Russia, India, United States, Europe and Rest of the World. Garry Kasparov as European captain is a significant move, and not just from a playing viewpoint. The Fide president, Arkady Dvorkovich, used to be Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, while Kasparov is well known as a vehement critic of Vladimir Putin. A trigger for the rapprochement could be the absence of Carlsen from the list of players, requiring another globally recognised name to fill the vacuum.\nThe complete list of players shows Kasparov only as the non-playing captain of the European team, disappointing chess fans who hoped that the event would provide an occasion for an inter-generational legends game between the great Russian and the new star Firouzja.\nIt could still happen if Fide organisers are imaginative and make Kasparov v Firouzja a launch game for the opening of the match.\n3668: (a) Rbc8! is best and should win.

Now I am on duty all the time and it is absolutely draining.\u201d\nCarers UK is calling for the government to recognise the extra pressures on unpaid carers during the pandemic and increase the carer\u2019s allowance, which is \u00a367.25 a week for those doing 35 hours or more of care.\nHelen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK, said: \u201cUnpaid carers are fighting the same battle as care staff and many of our NHS workers, yet they do it behind closed doors and with far less recognition. Unlike our fantastic frontline workers, they are unable to clock off from their caring responsibilities. Many are overwhelmed and incredibly anxious about how they will manage.\n\u201cUnpaid carers are just as vital in the national effort to keep vulnerable people safe, yet many fear that continuing to care around the clock will lead to them burning out.\u201d\nThe survey found that the cost of caring had significantly increased since the crisis began, with the vast majority of unpaid carers spending more on food and household bills.\n\u201cIt is simply unacceptable that carer\u2019s allowance is the lowest benefit of its kind, when unpaid carers contribute so much and at a significant cost to their own finances,\u201d Walker said.\nThe Carer\u2019s UK survey echoes research by Dr Siobhan O\u2019Dwyer at the University of Exeter. Her team conducts weekly interviews with carers to see how their experiences are changing as the pandemic progresses, and her findings are shared with government departments to inform policy.\n\u201cDespite being the invisible scaffolding that holds up the NHS and social care in the UK, carers have been largely ignored in public discussions about the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cToday\u2019s Carers UK findings paint a stark picture of life for carers in lockdown, and as time goes on the situation may become even more dire.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cAt this time, the role of unpaid carers is even more important, and we have been clear unpaid carers can continue to claim carer\u2019s allowance if they need to self-isolate. We have also been clear that providing emotional support counts towards the carer\u2019s allowance threshold of 35 hours of care a week.\u201d",

        "content": "Majority of hospitality workers laid off during coronavirus lockdown, survey shows\nEight in 10 workers in the UK accommodation and food services sector have been furloughed, according to a survey.\nResearch by the Office for National Statistics found that the sector, which covers hotels, restaurants and pubs, temporarily laid off the largest proportion of workers after the lockdown began.\nOn Monday the Treasury launched the coronavirus job retention scheme, which reimburses companies for up to 80% of the wages for employees who are furloughed rather than made redundant, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month.\nBy Thursday 435,000 firms had applied for nearly \u00a33.8bn worth of support to pay the wages of 3.2 million workers.\nThe ONS figures are based on a survey of 6,150 businesses, which found that together they had furloughed more than a quarter of their workforce.\nIt said 81% of businesses in accommodation and food services had closed temporarily or ceased trading. That figure was higher only in the art, entertainment and recreation industry, where 82% of firms are not operating. These businesses have furloughed 68% of workers, the ONS found.\nNot all workers in the accommodation industry qualify to be furloughed, with those who started seasonal jobs recently or with contracts due to start for the summer locked out of the scheme.\nIn the construction industry, where work on many sites has been halted, 42% of the workforce has been furloughed.\nThe hospitality industry has said 1m jobs are at risk without further government support if physical distancing measures continue beyond the end of the year.\nThe chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, Kate Nicholls, called for a plan of phased reopenings of hotels, bars, pubs and restaurants. She also urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to extend the furlough scheme beyond its current end point of June.\n\u201cWe need a plan of phased opening for our sector. For those businesses that can trade safely with social distancing measures still in place, they should be able to,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the many venues where it is not possible, support, such as the furlough scheme, must be extended to make sure these businesses stay alive and jobs kept open.\u201d\nThe Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has said pubs, restaurants and hotels will be \u201camong the last\u201d businesses to exit the coronavirus lockdown.\nThere are some signs that Sunak has in the main succeeded in persuading businesses to retain staff rather than make them redundant. Among businesses responding to its survey, the ONS said those that were still trading or had temporarily paused operations had made less than 1% of their workforce redundant.\nAs many as 8 million workers could be furloughed in total, according to estimates from the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which said low-paid hospitality and retail companies would be affected most.\nThe ONS figures, which cover the period from 23 March to 5 April, show that businesses that had paused trading furloughed 78% of staff, while those that were still trading had told 14% to stay at home.\nSome companies have furloughed staff who need to look after children, and a separate ONS survey showed the difficulty those still working were having in balancing their jobs with homeschooling. Research done in the run-up to the Easter weekend found that 71% of adults with a dependent child were homeschooling, and 42% felt it was having a negative impact on their job.",

France\u2019s Bernard Laporte, who is running for election as World Rugby\u2019s vice-chairman, has also proposed a club World Cup which would effectively kill off Europe\u2019s elite cross-border club competition, an idea later described as \u201ca misunderstanding\u201d by Bill Beaumont, World Rugby\u2019s chairman.\nEuropean Professional Club Rugby, however, has stressed it is looking at staging the closing stages of its tournaments in mid-October on the weekends allocated for the first two rounds of the 2020-21 campaign and is calling for proper consultation with its leading officials. \u201cWe absolutely do not accept a schedule of international rugby in October,\u201d said Simon Halliday, EPCR\u2019s chairman. \u201cThat directly clashes with us and we are informing World Rugby we fully intend to use our October window if we need it. We could play our semis and finals on those two weekends or, alternatively, just use one of them for the final and try and find two other dates in August and September for the quarters and semis.\u201d\nUncertainty clearly still surrounds the precise date when a resumption of rugby in Europe will be practicable but EPCR has strongly denied whispers from Ireland that the 2019\u201120 season might be curtailed early. \u201cWhen you have club tournaments locked into multi-year contracts with partners and broadcasters, which is the lifeblood of the game, you can\u2019t just cancel everything. If we don\u2019t do what we are contracted to do, there are serious ramifications,\u201d said Halliday.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be bailed out by World Rugby, we don\u2019t have that luxury. But we\u2019re all connected, we\u2019re all part of the same game. The value of our tournament, the Premiership, the Pro14 and the Top 14, collectively, is close to a billion pounds. Before people start saying what is valuable, it constitutes a very large \u2013 and increasing \u2013 percentage of the world\u2019s rugby revenue. Significant investment has been made in European rugby.\u201d\nThe organisers have indicated they would, if necessary, be prepared to stage major knockout games, such as quarter-finals involving Exeter v Northampton and Leinster v Saracens, behind closed doors. In terms of qualification for next season, leeway may also be given to clubs, such as Toulouse, who sit just outside the European qualification places domestically with the Top 14 regular season having been halted. \u201cIf our finals do end up being played in October we would then look at the following season and operate a different format to allow for the exceptional difficulties encountered this season,\u201d said Halliday.\nThe former England centre is also adamant any new playing calendar must prioritise the players\u2019 welfare, both on and off the field, and is urging all rugby\u2019s stakeholders to come together at a time of significant global upheaval and human suffering. \u201cWe\u2019re in times of real crisis here and we are not oblivious to worst-case scenarios. None of us entirely knows what will happen but everyone\u2019s position in the game has to be respected. You\u2019ve got to include the clubs and provinces of Europe at the heart of the conversation.\u201d",

        "content": "Scientists say insects are vital and the losses worrying, with accelerating declines in Europe called \u2018shocking\u2019 \nThe biggest assessment of global insect abundances to date shows a worrying drop of almost 25% in the last 30 years, with accelerating declines in Europe that shocked scientists.\nThe analysis combined 166 long-term surveys from almost 1,700 sites and found that some species were bucking the overall downward trend. In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops.\nResearchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.\nInsects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, outweighing humanity by 17 times, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature\u2019s waste.\nThe previous largest assessment, based on 73 studies, led scientists to warn of \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind\u201d if insect losses were not halted. Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate 50% of insects have been lost in the last 50 years.\nRecent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in Germany and 98% in Puerto Rico. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: \u201cThis 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It\u2019s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.\u201d\nThe research, published in the journal Science, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. \u201cEurope seems to be getting worse now \u2013 that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.\nElsewhere, data is much more sparse. \u201cBut we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat \u2013 it is not rocket science,\u201d said van Klink. \u201cThis is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There\u2019s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don\u2019t have the data.\u201d\nVan Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. \u201cWe found that very striking and a bit shocking \u2013 it means something\u2019s going wrong there.\u201d\nLosses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, pesticides and light pollution. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite obvious local examples. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.\nBut he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and significantly cutting grasshopper abundances on prairies in Kansas, US. \u201dThat is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.\u201d\nProf Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: \u201cPeople should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.\u201d\nMatt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: \u201cMany insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.\nIn a comment article in Science, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. \u201cEmbracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,\u201d they said.\nVan Klink said: \u201cWe definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.\u201d",

On Wednesday there were only 23,560 tests, still below an interim target of 25,000 tests by the middle of April. The 100,000 target has been dismissed as arbitrary and overambitious, but Hancock is determined to meet it. He claims the criteria can be expanded because there is now greater capacity for testing but too few people have been coming forward for tests. These would be tests for whether people currently have the virus, not antibody tests to show if people have previously been infected.\nNot yet, but Hancock claims the government is on course to meet the target in terms of capacity, if not the tests themselves. On Thursday he said capacity had increased overnight from 40,000 to 51,000 tests, which he claimed was ahead of schedule.\nYes, according to Hancock. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test,\u201d he said.\nInitially only patients in hospital could get tests. When Hancock pledged the 100,000 target by the end of April, he also announced plans to test NHS staff. Later he broadened the criteria to include care home staff.\nUp to 10 million essential workers and their families in England who are showing symptoms of coronavirus. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff, the list includes teachers, judges, some lawyers, religious staff, and journalists providing public service broadcasting. Also included are local civil servants, police, armed service personnel, fire and rescue service staff, immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets, those in food production, essential financial services and information technology, as well as those working in the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors.\nEmployers of essential workers will be able to apply on the government\u2019s website to get a test for any of their staff. From Friday any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on the website themselves. Hancock said: \u201cThis also applies for people in essential workers\u2019 households too who need a test.\u201d\nAfter entering your details on the government website, essential workers will then get a text or an email inviting them for an appointment. After taking a test, results will be sent out by text or email within about two days. Those testing positive with mild symptoms will be expected to follow the government\u2019s isolation guidelines.\nThere are regional test sites in around 30 locations across England, with more planned. The army will be providing mobile testing sites in more remote areas. And Hancock also promised home testing kits.",

        "content": "Millions of workers and relatives will be able to book appointment online from Friday\nTesting for coronavirus is to be made available to millions of key workers and their families in England, with appointments to be booked online, the health secretary has announced.\nThe system, unveiled at Downing Street\u2019s daily press conference, involves a dramatic expansion of the people who can be tested for the virus, as the government continues to try to reach its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of April.\nThe government estimates that there are 10 million key workers in the UK who will be eligible for the swab test, which has previously been available only to health workers. The tests will also be offered to the families of key workers, and it is expected that the devolved administrations will follow suit.\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cWe can make it easier, faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test.\n\u201cAny essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on gov.uk themselves directly. This applies for people in essential workers\u2019 households too, who need a test. It\u2019s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.\u201d\nThe main focus for tests, available from Friday, will be the antigen variety, which tells people whether they currently have the illness. Antigen swab testing can show medics what treatment a patient should receive and who should isolate and who is able to return to work.\nAn antibody blood test showing whether someone has had the illness in the past, which some have argued is more useful, will be used by the government in its forthcoming survey of the disease.\nThe government has so far been under fire for setting an ambitious target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, while drive-through testing facilities have been shown to be underused and difficult for care workers to access if they do not own a car.\nCapacity currently stands at 51,000 tests a day. In the last 24 hours, 23,560 tests were carried out on 14,629 people.\nProfessor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, who is coordinating testing, told the press conference that the government was on track to meet its 100,000 target.\nContact tracing will be rolled out on a \u201clarge scale\u201d with a new NHS app, Hancock said. If you are unwell, you can inform the app, which can let other people with it downloaded know that they have recently been in contact with someone with suspected coronavirus.\nTo \u201ckickstart\u201d tracing, the government will hire 18,000 people, including 3,000 clinicians and public health experts, who will be trained over the coming weeks.\nThe range of jobs classed as essential is extensive, and includes teachers and support staff, people in the justice system, charities, workers delivering key frontline services, transport workers and those working for local government.\nThe process is free and results will be sent out by text, with a helpdesk set up to deal with queries.\nThe shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Labour had consistently asked for a testing and tracing strategy. He said: \u201cIt is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers such as care staff are now able to access testing.\n\u201cWe will continue to hold the government to account for the promise it has made of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.\u201d\nTeaching unions and school leaders have welcomed the announcement that school staff will be able to access coronavirus testing, with some calling it an essential precondition before schools are reopened.\n Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cSchool staff have been on the frontline in the national response to coronavirus. We have been clear from the start that governments across the UK understand they must honour this effort with the appropriate level of support and safety.\n\u201cIf testing can be delivered effectively, then it will be welcomed by the education sector.\u201d\nKevin Courtney of the National Education Union said the immediate priority was for teachers who were self-isolating to get tested, and that so far the government had been slow to respond.\nThe number of drive-through test centres will increase from 30 to 48 and the army will run 48 mobile testing units, which will be used to target care homes.",

It saves some cities. And there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available. My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.\u201d\nCuomo, who has repeatedly demanded that Congress provide more funding for states to cover the costs of the coronavirus crisis, said McConnell\u2019s suggestion was \u201cone of the really dumb ideas of all time\u201d.\nThe governor, a Democrat, warned that states declaring bankruptcies could cause \u201ca collapse of this national economy\u201d.\nCuomo also lambasted McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky, for suggesting relief money for states would represent a bailout for Democratic states, which have generally been harder hit by the virus.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever a time for humanity and decency, now\u2019s the time,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHow irresponsible and how reckless.\u201d\nStates do not have the right to declare bankruptcy under US law, and legislative changes would be needed to allow that. Declaring bankruptcy generally affords certain powers and protections during financial restructuring.\nCuomo not only dismissed the idea, he noted that New York produces much more revenue for the federal government than Kentucky does.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your state that is living on the money that we generate,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYour state is being bailed out, not my state.\u201d\nNew York quickly became the center of the US outbreak of coronavirus, following the earliest known cases and deaths on the west coast, in California and Washington.\nCuomo has spent several weeks in his daily briefings asking the federal government to help with critical medical supplies that individual states were not in a position to stockpile or acquire overnight, especially ventilators, and has lately pleaded for money to fund widespread testing for the disease and levels of immunity.\nMeanwhile evidence is emerging that far more New Yorkers have had the coronavirus than the number confirmed by lab tests.\nA state survey of around 3,000 people found that 13.9% had antibodies, suggesting they had been exposed to the virus, Cuomo said, warning results were preliminary.\nNew York City\u2019s health commissioner, Dr Oxiris Barbot, said as many as a million people in New York City, out of a population of 8.4 million, may have been exposed to the coronavirus.\nMore than 263,000 people in the city have tested positive for the virus, \u201cbut that really is, I think, the tip of the iceberg\u201d, Barbot said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "German chancellor urges cautions as EU leaders meet to discuss Europe-wide recovery fund\nAngela Merkel has said the coronavirus pandemic is \u201cstill at the beginning\u201d and parts of Germany may be rushing their exit from lockdown, as divided EU leaders clashed at a video summit over a desperately needed Europe-wide recovery fund.\nWorried that Germans were relaxing physical distancing efforts amid the reopening of smaller shops this week, the chancellor said some of Germany\u2019s 16 states were moving too fast and the country remained \u201con the thinnest ice\u201d despite its early achievements.\nGermany has the fifth highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, but has managed to keep its death toll down to just over 5,000, a far lower tally than in many other countries, mainly through early and extensive testing.\n\u201cIt is precisely because the figures give rise to hope that I feel obliged to say that this interim result is fragile,\u201d Merkel told parliament. \u201cWe are still far from out of the woods. We are not in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning.\u201d\nChristian Drosten, the director of the Institute for Virology at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital, said reopening shopping malls and larger stores could trigger a second wave in May and June, and the country risked \u201cgambling away\u201d its early advantage. Schools in Germany are due to reopen from 4 May and Merkel and state leaders are due to meet again on 30 April to review how to proceed after that.\nIn France, Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that a detailed plan to exit lockdown would be unveiled early next week. Pupils will return to French schools from 11 May, and the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said he hoped retailers other than restaurants, bars and cafes could reopen from the same date.\n\u201cWe want all retail outlets to be able to open in the same way, out of fairness,\u201d said Le Maire. Bars and restaurants were unlikely to reopen before mid-June \u201cbecause they are places of mixing\u201d, he added.\nRetailers would need to limit the number of people in their shops at one time, Le Maire said, and the hardest-hit regions, such as eastern France and greater Paris, may have to wait longer for shops to reopen. Older people\u2019s movements may also be restricted.\nThe public health authority chief, J\u00e9rome Salomon, said avoiding a second wave of infections remained the priority.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s goal is not to create collective immunity by creating a second and then a third wave,\u201d he told a parliamentary hearing. \u201cThat seems too dangerous to us. The goal is to prevent the circulation of the virus, and to create favourable conditions allowing us to gain time before the arrival of effective drugs or vaccines.\u201d\nCompanies have been told they should encourage employees to continue working from home if they can to limit public transport use, and the government aims to raise its testing programme to about 500,000 tests a week. France has the world\u2019s fourth highest death toll at more than 20,000.\nIn Italy the northern region of Lombardy, at the centre of Europe\u2019s worst outbreak, began an antibody testing programme as it prepared to start opening up its economy. Blood tests to establish whether someone has had \u2013 rather than currently has \u2013 the disease will be carried out in 14 of the worst-hit areas before being extended to the whole region next week.\nMeanwhile, Sweden\u2019s public health agency revised earlier statements about when the capital Stockholm was believed to have passed the peak of infections. A report by the agency published earlier this week, based on statistical modelling, said the capital region passed the peak of simultaneous infections on 15 April, with 86,000 people believed to be have been infected. But on Thursday it revised the date to 8 April, with 70,500 believed to have been infected.\nAs EU leaders haggled over a rescue package that has reignited a bitter north-south divide between member states, Merkel also said Germany was ready to make \u201csignificantly higher\u201d EU budget contributions to help the bloc cope with the fallout from the pandemic.\nShe added, however, that calls from some EU countries for common debt with common liabilities were not the way to go. \u201cThat would be a very difficult process, cost time and wouldn\u2019t even help anyone in the current situation, since we need rapid-fire instruments to tackle the crisis,\u201d she said.\nIn other developments:\nGlobal infections passed 2.6 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with nearly 185,000 deaths.\nThe latest US jobless figures confirmed that 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the past five weeks.\nThe number of new coronavirus cases in Russia fell for a second day. The figure has remained below record levels for four days, raising hopes that the outbreak there may have reached a plateau.\nGreece is extending lockdown measures by a week, to 4 May.\nSpain clarified that children aged 14 or under would be allowed out to walk and play in the streets for an hour a day from Sunday as long as they stay within a kilometre of their homes and are accompanied by an adult.\nVietnam eased physical distancing measures, with experts pointing to a decisive response involving mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing for its success in recording just 268 cases and zero deaths.\nChina said it would give another $30m to the World Health Organization, days after the US said it would freeze funding. The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said a fundamental reform of the WHO was needed and that the US may never restore its funding.",

        "content": "Games could resume next month with just over 300 people in the ground and strict safety measures in place\nThe historic is about to become the everyday in Germany. As it stands, the derby between Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Cologne \u2013 the last Bundesliga match played before the shutdown \u2013 is the only Geisterspiel (\u201cghost game\u201d, without fans) ever to have taken place in the top flight. When elite German football resumes at some point in May, as now seems inevitable, this unique spectacle will become just the tip of an echoey iceberg.\nThe Bundesliga is set to become the first elite European league to restart following the Covid-19 pandemic shutdown, and the chief executive of the German league (DFL), Christian Seifert, has said the league is ready to get going as soon as 9 May. Though it seems the governing body\u2019s preference was to begin a week or two later, it has made it clear it will be guided by \u201cwhat the politicians decide\u201d.\nAngela Merkel is scheduled to meet the 16 leaders of the country\u2019s federal states on 30 April. The outcome of those talks will be crucial to the Bundesliga having a plan that can be rolled out with national consensus, so we will have clarity sooner rather than later. In terms of how, rather than when football will return, we are most of the way there already.\nA DFL task force has already been put into action, led by the German national team physician, Dr Tim Meyer. It will plan every last detail of safety and hygiene, leading on from the clubs\u2019 training programmes into matchdays. For the games, there will be strict controls, with 322 people present in the stadium. This includes 98 in the \u201cinterior\u201d (players, coaching and medical staff), 115 in the stands (including media) and 109 more within the stadium perimeter (security, TV production staff).\nPress conferences will be held virtually and sinks will be installed at regular intervals in working areas. The task force has also designed an 18-point plan to cover best practice on away trips, which includes banning players from communal buffets or wellness areas, directing them not to touch elevator buttons \u2013 elbows have been suggested as an alternative to the index finger \u2013 and even designating an optimal temperature and humidity level for the players\u2019 rooms.\nRegular testing will also be key in a nation which has \u201cflattened the curve\u201d of coronavirus more successfully than many of its European neighbours, via the means of mass testing. There has been some disquiet over whether testing players is really a priority during a pandemic, and the Bundesliga has been acutely conscious not to be seen to be receiving preferential treatment. Seifert is keen to emphasise that football will account for \u201conly 0.4%\u201d of nationwide test capacity.\nSeifert struck a conciliatory tone in his press conference which followed Thursday\u2019s meeting on how to proceed. The German league\u2019s chief said he understood those who would oppose the DFL\u2019s drive to resume, even if for \u201cpurely emotional reasons because it just doesn\u2019t feel right\u201d. At the same time, he didn\u2019t attempt to duck the financial motivations behind the current plans. The resumption, Seifert said starkly, was \u201cthe only way to keep the Bundesliga and the 2 Bundesliga alive\u201d.\nSome have called this scaremongering, particularly given recent progress made in talks between the DFL and the Bundesliga\u2019s domestic TV rights holders. The season\u2019s final tranche of \u20ac304m (\u00a3265m) due had been in doubt after games stopped, but an agreement appeared to take the pressure off. The main rights holders, Sky, and public broadcasters ZDF and ARD agreed to pay the bulk of the outstanding payment, albeit with a slight delay. Seifert also confirmed on Thursday that a deal had been reached with two other broadcast partners, Dazn and Eurosport.\nIt is the lack of gate receipts that will leave clubs feeling the pinch. Schalke wrote to their fans a few weeks ago and asked them to consider waiving refunds for the remainder of their season tickets which they won\u2019t be able to use. This was to ensure the continued \u201cfinancial health\u201d of the club; fans who do so have been offered a special commemorative jersey in return. This is the club with the seventh-highest average attendance in European football \u2013 and the presence of Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the six above them underlines just how much matchday is part of the Bundesliga, financially as well as in terms of personality.\nThe DFL\u2019s conservative estimate was that four top-flight sides and up to half of the 18-team second division faced the possibility of bankruptcy if the season didn\u2019t restart by June. The hope is that stadiums will be full again next season, with the Bundesliga reclaiming its full allure. Seifert is keen to have clubs take responsibility for future-proofing, imploring them to not include gate receipts for \u201cJanuary, February or March\u201d in their budgets going forward, in case a second wave of Covid-19 requires a stoppage next season.\nMany fans are deeply unhappy about the prospect of the Bundesliga resuming in empty stadiums. Fanszenen Deutschlands, a nationwide union of ultra groups, is no stranger to criticising German football\u2019s business model and didn\u2019t hold back when rejecting the whole Geisterspiele concept. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to society,\u201d the group said in a statement, \u201cand in particular to those fighting Covid-19 on a daily basis. Professional football has long been sick and should still be in quarantine.\u201d\nSeifert encouraged clubs to open dialogue with those supporters but once again made the governing body\u2019s stance clear. In March, a few thousand Gladbach fans gathered outside Borussia-Park to celebrate their derby win, on the same night PSG supporters congregated at the Parc des Princes after their Champions League win against Dortmund. Seifert suggested that mass gatherings of fans could lead to matches being abandoned, with a 2-0 defeat imposed on the offending club.\nWith swathes of the continent, and the world, eager to be reunited with football even on limited terms, the heightened prospect of the Bundesliga\u2019s return might be beguiling. Yet beyond the headlines of imminent dates, more compromise on all sides is still required to make it work out.",

It is one of the drugs Donald Trump claimed was \u201cpromising\u201d.\nIn a \u201cgold standard\u201d trial of 237 patients, some of whom received remdesivir while others did not, the drug did not work.\nNews of the failure was posted on a World Health Organization clinical trials database, but later removed. A WHO spokesman said it had been uploaded too soon by accident.\n\u201cA draft document was provided by the authors to WHO and inadvertently posted on the website and taken down as soon as the mistake was noticed. The manuscript is undergoing peer review and we are waiting for a final version before WHO comments,\u201d said Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson.\nThe drug, made by the US company Gilead Sciences, is an antiviral that was trialled in Ebola, but which failed to show benefits in Africa.\nIn the race for drugs that might work against Covid-19, many doctors have given remdesivir to patients on \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d without waiting for trials. Because of the interest in it, the world\u2019s biggest trial of possible treatments for Covid-19 at Oxford has not been able to include it, because researchers could not obtain supplies.\nThe trial of the drug in China, on patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms, may give some doctors pause. Gilead, however, claimed there were still signs that it could be useful, possibly in patients with milder versions of disease.\nIn the trial, 158 patients were randomly assigned to be given remdesivir, while 79 others had standard care with a placebo instead. There was no difference between the groups with respect to recovery time. Just under 14% of those on remdesivir died, compared with nearly 13% of those not taking the treatment.\n\u201cIn this study of hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19, [which] was terminated prematurely, remdesivir was not associated with clinical or virological benefits,\u201d said the report on the WHO website.\nThe report added: \u201cRemdesivir was stopped early in 18 (11.6%) patients because of adverse effects, compared with 4 (5.1%) in the control group.\u201d There were no details in the short report of the side effects.\nJust a week ago, it emerged that researchers in Chicago were excited by the results of a Gilead-run trial of remdesivir in 125 patients. Nearly all those people were discharged within a week, according to STAT News, which follows the pharmaceutical industry. However, there was no placebo group, which meant researchers could not be sure that it was the drug that made the difference, and not something else.\nRemdesivir is one of a handful of drugs that have been enthusiastically backed by doctors and politicians as potential cures for Covid-19. There has also been a rush to give patients hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic version of the antimalarial chloroquine. That has led to shortages for people who need to take it for lupus, a disease that affects the immune system.\nScientists who want to see proper trials conducted are likely to point to the remdesivir trial failure as strong evidence of the dangers of giving out even tested drugs on compassionate grounds for a disease that is so novel.\n This article was amended on 30 April 2020. An earlier version said that the remdesivir trial had been stopped early because of side-effects. Although some patients were taken off the drug because of side-effects, it was stopped early because they did not recruit enough patients.",

In other cases, the test centre, which is about 12 miles south-west of central London, was unable to ring through with the diagnosis because of a failure to record correct phone numbers.\nIn an email written in early April, and seen by the Guardian, the chief executive of Epsom hospital said: \u201cDeloitte who have been commissioned by the Department of Health directly for this are not running this as well as we would like \u2026 [We] are asking whether we can take over the running of the Chessington centre because we really need it to work much better than it is.\u201d\nIt is understood that the request to remove the firm was made in the first week of April, but that it was set aside after performance improved.\nThe Department for Health said late Thursday that 49 people had experienced delays, and 39 had now received their results. The ministry said it would continue to investigate the remainder and offer any workers still waiting a new test.\n\u201cWe are also implementing further processes within the department to ensure rapid investigation of outstanding test results that are not provided to those tested within 48 hours,\u201d a spokesman said.\nHowever, Epsom hospital stopped sending staff to Chessington 10 days ago after finding a more convenient alternative, it said. Staff are now swabbed at work and the samples sent to the laboratory at St George\u2019s hospital, south London for analysis.\nEpsom could soon be able to do the analysis itself, having ordered four machines made by a company spun out from Cambridge University, which can complete the process in 90 minutes.\nThe Chessington centre\u2019s problems appear not to have been entirely resolved. A paramedic for the south-east coast ambulance service, who asked not to be named, said he had been tested along with a group of colleagues on 3 April. They were still waiting to hear from Chessington.\n\u201cNone of us from my place of work, tested on that Friday, have had our results,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were told our samples were taken to a lab in Southampton. It\u2019s three weeks since the test and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to get the result. No one\u2019s been in touch other than my managers to say they\u2019re chasing it.\u201d\nThe paramedic questioned the involvement of Deloitte, which specialises in management consultancy, tax and accounting but has little experience in running public services. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what is essentially an accountancy company can bring to this.\u201d\nA doctor at Epsom hospital, who was among the first to be tested at the end of March while self-isolating at home with symptoms, said she was still waiting to hear; after making enquiries she was told Deloitte could only release information to the person being tested, and not the organisation referring them. She has since been tested by her hospital.\nAsked to comment, Daniel Elkeles, who runs Epsom, and its sister hospital, St Helier, in Carshalton, Surrey, said there were \u201cclearly teething problems at Chessington at the start of this contract\u201d.\n\u201cWe are now assured that those teething problems are fixed and that the service is reliable. But it\u2019s much more convenient for our staff to be swabbed [at the] Epsom and St Helier sites, and for us to send the swabs to St George\u2019s for testing. This means our staff don\u2019t have to travel to Chessington and also means the facility has more capacity for other parts of the health and care system.\u201d\nNormally, government contracts over a certain value are advertised publicly and awarded after a competitive tender.\nHowever, it is understood that the health department appointed Deloitte without competition, under an obscure piece of legislation introduced in 2015 which ministries have been told they can use during the pandemic to avoid lengthy tendering processes.\nA Deloitte spokesman said: \u201cDeloitte, alongside many other public and private sector partners, is supporting DHSC (the Department of Health and Social Care) to help accelerate and scale testing capacity for the national Covid-19 testing programme.\u201d",

        "content": "Company has struggled to meet security needs as user base has risen sharply amid coronavirus lockdown\nThe video-conferencing platform Zoom has released a new update this week in an effort to address an onslaught of security concerns surrounding the service.\nZoom says the newest version of its app, Zoom 5.0, includes encryption and new privacy controls, updates that are part of a 90-day plan to improve security and privacy on the platform.\n\u201cI am proud to reach this step in our 90-day plan, but this is just the beginning,\u201d Eric Yuan, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a call on Wednesday. \u201cWe will earn our customers\u2019 trust and deliver them happiness with our unwavering focus on providing the most secure platform.\u201d\nZoom has struggled to meet security needs as the platform has scaled up its user base to unprecedented levels in recent months.\nSince the coronavirus lockdown, Zoom\u2019s daily active users shot up from around 10 million to 300 million as people use the platform for happy hours, work meetings, support groups and even funerals.\nUsers struggled with persistent \u201cZoom-bombing\u201d, a new kind of attack in which bad actors enter video meetings and shout slurs and threats in an attempt to disrupt them. Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were targeted in particular.\nZoom 5.0 will allow hosts to \u201creport a user\u201d to Zoom with a new security button and the app now defaults users to a \u201cwaiting room\u201d feature, which requires participants to be approved to enter a meeting. All meetings will now require a password to enter.\nZoom also added a new encryption standard, called AES 256-bit GCM encryption, which is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d of encryption and is used by the US government to secure data.\nThe change will help prevent meetings from being hijacked by hackers, said Thomas Hatch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Utah-based software firm SaltStack.\n\u201cThe encryption that has been introduced improves the liability that existed before where video conferences could be hijacked out of line,\u201d he said. \u201cThis adds a much better layer of privacy that was not present before.\u201d\nIn addition to Zoom bombing concerns, the app had also received criticism over major bugs in recent months, including one that would allow a hacker to take full control over the user\u2019s computer. To address these concerns, Zoom has beefed up its bug bounty program, incentivizing security professionals to alert them to bugs before hackers can exploit them.\nIn a call on Wednesday, Yuan reiterated that Zoom will not sell user data. Zoom had been forced to change its policies around data sale after a story from Motherboard at Vice revealed Zoom sends data from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes, even if the user does not have a Facebook account.\nZoom is not the only video conferencing platform, but it is easily one of the most popular. That is largely because of how easy it is to use, said Hank Schless, a senior manager at tech security firm Lookout.\n\u201cThe widespread use of conferencing solutions like Zoom shows how people are OK with putting convenience ahead of security,\u201d he said. \u201cZoom got a lot of attention because users were not turning on many of its security settings. Despite that, they continue to log in every day because they assume the likelihood of being a victim is too low to affect them.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 24 April 2020 to clarify that Zoom\u2019s new encryption standard is not encrypted end-to-end.",

        "content": "NHS England sends out emergency guidance following a shortage of dialysis fluids\nHospitals are having to conserve life-saving dialysis fluid in the coming days because of national shortages, as it has been revealed that 28% of coronavirus patients in intensive care who need significant help to breathe also need kidney support.\nAccording to the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, more than one in four critically ill coronavirus patients on advanced respiratory support need dialysis for an average time of four days to keep them alive.\nThe shortages have forced NHS England to send out emergency guidance to trusts telling them to conserve supplies and lend fluids to each other where needed.\nThe guidance advises a new strategy, including limiting trusts to four days\u2019 supply and advising equipment to connect the patient to dialysis machines can be used for longer than previous guidance stated.\nThe letter said: \u201cThe revised strategy should be to conserve both fluids and sets [equipment used to connect the patient to a dialysis machine] used in CVVH [a form of dialysis] and it is recommended that the following actions are taken. In contrast to previous guidance, sets should be used for 24-48 hours. If the supply of machines allows, the use of the set may continue longer up to the recommended time permitted,\u201d said James Palmer, the national medical director of specialised services at NHS England, in a letter.\nIt continued: \u201cTo further conserve fluid stocks, CVVH is preferred to CVVHD [a type of dialysis that uses more fluid], but individualised case by case. During the current clinical scenario, the addition dialysis (CVVHD mode) should be rarely needed.\u201d\nAnother letter said that providers should be limited to ordering four days of supply. It added: \u201cOn Monday 27 April the supply chain constraints will be reviewed so further ordering frequency can be defined aiming to move to weekly orders as soon as stocks allow.\u201d\nThe letter said: \u201cWith units who have less than four days supply in stock from 22 April, based upon recent usage, should place new orders for four days clinical requirements only (Thursday 23 April through to Sunday 26 April).\u201d\nIt advised trusts to work together to support each other seeking \u201ca mutual aid solution supported by the critical care and renal networks\u201d.\nIt said: \u201cThe networks should actively contact all the constituent providers to identify available stock. If a network solution is determined escalation is required to the regional incident team to determine whether a cross network solution is possible.\u201d\nDialysis is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned.\nContinuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) uses fluids to draw out the byproducts of metabolism when the kidneys are failing to pass it out. Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) uses pressure, and less fluids that CVVHD, to filter out the byproducts of metabolism. It is a temporary treatment for patients with acute renal failure who are unstable. With CVVH, a dialysis catheter is placed in one of the main veins of the body. Different forms of dialysis use differing amounts of fluids.\nA doctor who works with coronavirus patients, speaking anonymously, said: \u201cThere is clearly a concern about the nation\u2019s ability to provide renal replacement therapy during the pandemic. Renal failure is often a complicating development in patients that are critically ill. If supplies of fluid and sets run low enough, then difficult decisions will have to be made about who receives renal replacement therapy and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt seems that [the person who wrote the letter] is worried our capacity to provide renal replacement will run dry without proper management of fluids and consumables.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the issues had with covid is around the fact that more patients need support for kidneys than previously,\u201d said the vice-dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, Dr Daniele Bryden.\n\u201cFor example, in China about 15% of patients in intensive care needed kidney support and we are noticing a higher number in the UK. In London some areas are reporting 25% patients needing some degree of support with kidneys.\u201d\nBryden said it was unclear why this was. \u201cNo one knows why that is but one thing it may be is that we are not seeing the same population being affected, we may have a higher population in the UK of more people at risk of kidney failure.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThose with high blood pressure and diabetes are more at risk of ending up in intensive care with covid \u2026 [They are] also groups of people with low level risk getting kidney issues when they become unwell.\u201d\n\u201cNationally we are looking to support each other and make sure kidney support is provided so we are giving it in a different way or using support from dialysis facilities in hospital or locally if you have got them.\u201d\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThere is significant global pressure on the supplies of the particular types of renal replacement therapies being used to treat Covid-19 patients who develop kidney problems, and the NHS is working with government and our partners to ensure supplies are maintained.\u201d",

The bracken, which smothers competitors, has already started growing again, and would have been cut back this week.\nHimalayan balsam is also a concern. The ecologically damaging flower can grow up to a height of three metres (10ft) in one spring and summer season. But annual \u201cbalsam bashing\u201d events by staff and volunteers have been halted.\nFive years of intensive work to clear brambles and scrub from two historic wildflower meadows at Cwm Colhuw nature reserve in Wales could now be undone. A spokesperson said: \u201cIf no management is continued on this site then very quickly, within 12 months, we will see scrub and brambles taking over once again and a decline of wildlife.\u201d\nPrecious heathland in Surrey reserves cannot be grazed, due to social distancing and movement restrictions. Managed grazing by livestock can benefit heathland, creating a mosaic of differing habitats. Without that complexity various creatures will be put at risk, including birds such as the nightjar and woodlark, and reptiles including smooth snakes and sand lizards.\n\u201cRestoring nature in the UK \u2013 one of the most nature depleted countries in the world \u2013 has become harder than ever during the pandemic,\u201d said the Wildlife Trusts. \u201cAt the same time, people are seeking solace in nature.\u201d\nHuge numbers of people are tuning in to the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 webcams, which have been showing barn owl chicks hatching and puffins emerging from their burrows. But staff still working are having to contend with illegal activities such as fly-tipping, vandalism and wildlife shooting.\nA dormice monitoring project in south-west Wales is threatened by a lack of funds. Rat control on islets off Alderney has been halted; staff reported seeing rats on camera traps eating the eggs of razorbills and guillemots.\nA hedgehog GPS tagging project, to establish if hedgehogs are eating the eggs of ground-nesting birds, is threatened. Sea bird and marine mammal counts have been abandoned, as have butterfly and scarce plant monitoring.\nMore than 60% of the human population in Britain live within a three-mile walk of a Wildlife Trust nature reserve.\nUrging people to support their local Wildlife Trust, Craig Bennett, the organisation\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cThe work of the Wildlife Trusts is critical \u2026 at a time when there\u2019s a big public conversation about the importance of nature, and access to it, in our everyday lives.\n\u201cThe Wildlife Trusts can be a vital part of our nation\u2019s recovery from the current health crisis. Nature brings health benefits and offers solutions to the other great emergency facing humanity \u2013 climate change \u2013 so it must be protected and allowed to recover.\u201d",

        "content": "Festival, normally marked by social gatherings and feasts, will be muted affair under lockdown\nRamadan is normally a sociable time, as abstention from food and water during daylight hours gives way to sumptuous meals and gatherings at dusk.\nBut this year, the coronavirus pandemic has cast a long shadow over the rituals, which have been modified to fit public health directives on physical distancing. The month of fasting and reflection, which has begun with the sighting of the crescent moon, will be observed by the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims mostly in private.\nMosques will remain closed to evening prayers and feasting will become a more intimate affair, within the confines of family homes. Large public banquets, provided by authorities, or benefactors, have been outlawed in much of the Islamic world, where curfews and lockdowns remain rigidly enforced.\nOver the past two months, Muslims in the Middle East and other parts of the world have become accustomed to a variation on the call to prayer, caused by state restrictions on social gatherings. From mosques across the world, the familiar summons \u201ccome to pray\u201d has been replaced by \u201cpray at home\u201d. And with the arrival of the year\u2019s most sacred month, the ban on getting together has become more pointed.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really looking forward to fasting this year, said Firas Mahmoud, a resident of the Lebanese capital Beirut. \u201cIt\u2019s in spring this year, which is better than the last nine years of summer, but having no one to break the fast with, it feels like suffering. It feels flat.\u201d\nAhead of the fast there was even discussion about whether going without sustenance for much of the day might have an effect on immunity \u2013 , and hence people\u2019s capacity to fight off Covid-19. However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary \u2013 that fasting may in fact be beneficial \u2013 the premise of this year\u2019s Ramadan remains unchanged.\n\u201cMuslim religious authorities around the world are advocating wide restrictions on gatherings, in or out of mosques, as a result of the [coronavirus] pandemic,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\u201cThe mosques will remain virtually closed; the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets; and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.\u201d\nRamadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. However, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead-up to the fast, religious authorities and governments were determined to ban congregational activities \u2013 a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to fraternise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.\nMosques across the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 in Egypt Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year.\nWith global travel grinding largely to a halt, supply lines have also suffered and there are fears that food may be in short supply in some areas. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had to worry about that,\u201d said Bashar Abu Samra, from the northern Lebanon city of Tripoli. \u201cA scarcity of food during Ramadan. Can you imagine?\u201d\nSome states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. The virus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies meanwhile have encouraged families to embrace this year\u2019s restrictions by focusing on intimate family members.\nIn a statement earlier this month, Egypt\u2019s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: \u201cWe must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.\u201d\nIn north-west Syria, where the fasting may at least put a stop to relentless war, Ahmad Mustafa, a shopkeeper in Idlib, said the month was still welcome. \u201cEverybody can pause to see where they\u2019re at. The world needs to change. And maybe this time it will happen for real.\u201d",

But at a time when our support has become more important than ever, our income faces a staggering drop, and the truth is we can\u2019t continue to be there for all the people who need us without the support of the public.\u201d\nThe nurses who have been redeployed to work elsewhere are likely to make up a big proportion of Macmillan\u2019s workforce. According to the latest available figures, 1,765 specialist cancer nurses in England \u2013 44% of the total \u2013 have \u201cMacmillan\u201d in their job title.\nAmong those who have been reassigned is Alison Boyd, an information centre manager, who has taken up a role in the family liaison and support team at the NHS Nightingale hospital in London.\nIn the meantime, volunteers will keep the Macmillan centre at Chelsea and Westminster running by offering phone-based support to patients. Boyd said: \u201cI just want to offer the same skills and compassion that we offer at the Chelwest Macmillan Centre.\u201d\nAn emergency appeal is being launched on Friday to help fund virtual services including video calls and virtual workshops to support patients\u2019 wellbeing, a volunteer telephone befriending service for those in isolation, and to recruit new workers.\nLast month Macmillan gave out grants to 3,500 people with cancer in financial hardship \u2013 a 14% increase compared with the monthly average for 2019 \u2013 totalling \u00a31.1m.\nUnder normal circumstances, during the three months when the coronavirus outbreak is expected to be at its worst in the UK \u2013 in March, April and May \u2013 the charity estimates there would be around 90,000 people newly diagnosed with cancer.\nIt said typically around 625,000 people in England and Wales would be referred by their GP for urgent tests for suspected cancer, and at least 40,000 people would require end-of-life support due to the disease.\nMacmillan has donated \u00a35m to a coronavirus response fund to support healthcare professionals and the NHS during the crisis.",

        "content": "Jenny McGee says British PM \u2018absolutely\u2019 needed to be in intensive care and tells of surreal experience of swapping emojis with Jacinda Ardern\nThe New Zealand intensive care nurse thanked by British prime minister Boris Johnson has revealed he was treated like \u201cany other patient\u201d \u2013 and originally thought his praise was a prank.\nJenny McGee said she had not been told of the public praise in advance. \u201cMy first reaction was that it was a joke. I thought my friends were playing a joke on me \u2026 it was totally out of the blue,\u201d she told TVNZ.\nThe 35-year-old \u2013 who has worked as an intensive care nurse for 10 years, five of those as a sister \u2013 highlighted just how ill Johnson was, saying: \u201cWe take it very seriously who comes into intensive care, these patients who come into us it\u2019s a very scary thing for them so we don\u2019t take it lightly. And he absolutely needed to be there.\u201d\nJohnson thanked \u201cJenny from Invercargill\u201d on his release from hospital on 13 April, crediting her and another nurse with saving his life after he contracted Covid-19 and became severely ill. Johnson said two nurses sat by his bed for 48 hours, nursing him through the darkest time when \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d.\nMcGee also revealed the toll the coronavirus restrictions were taking. \u201cPeople are dying without their loved ones around \u2026 we can be there to hold their hand but it should be their family and that\u2019s heartbreaking to watch,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proudly New Zealand and we are a wonderful group of people who just get on with it when we\u2019re up against it. The messages [from Kiwis] are adorable, there are kids telling me they want to be a nurse, there are families saying how proud they are, and it means so much [to me] right now.\u201d\n\u201cPeople will never know how much it means.\u201d\nMcGee said she and Johnson talked about New Zealand, and her home town of Invercargill \u2013 the country\u2019s most southern major town, famous for rugby, oysters and farming . \u201cHe was interested to know about Invercargill,\u201d she said.\nMcGee said the toughest part of the shift was the intense media interest in Johnson\u2019s care, with dozens of global television crews stationed outside the hospital around the clock.\nMcGee was holidaying back home in New Zealand in February and made a snap decision to return to St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London, where she felt her skills were needed as Covid-19 spread.\nFollowing Johnson\u2019s public praise of McGee, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern added her voice to mix, revealing she had messaged McGee on Facebook.\nMcGee told TVNZ she initially thought Ardern\u2019s public thank you was \u201ca prank\u201d too, because the prime minister was a hero of hers. The two exchanged multiple Facebook messages \u2013 and some banter, McGee told TVNZ.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a hero of mine, I think she\u2019s amazing, and she just said how proud she was of me, that the country was so proud, and it\u2019s so heartwarming and something I will never forget,\u201d McGee said.\n\u201cI responded [to Ardern] and she messaged back immediately, a little bit of banter which is again, surreal, a couple of emojis.\u201d\nMcGee said her workmates were \u201cgiving her stick\u201d for her overnight global fame, but that she loved them keeping her grounded and in good spirits as the tough work of looking after Covid-19 patients continued unabated.",

        "content": "Party that switched recognition from Taiwan to China last year lost majority in elections this week over handling of the move\nChina\u2019s diplomatic ambitions in the Pacific suffered a setback on Wednesday when the party that switched recognition from Taiwan to China last year lost its majority in parliament over its handling of the move.\nIn the second round of parliamentary elections, the governing party and allies won 22 seats out of 45, dealing a blow to President Taneti Maamau, who previously enjoyed a comfortable majority of 31.\nThe rest of the seats were won by members or allies of two other parties: one of which has pledged to switch back to Taiwan, and another made up of MPs who left the governing party to create a new opposition party last fall over Maamau\u2019s handling of the switch.\nKiribati, a country of 110,000 people in the central Pacific, severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established foreign relations with China in September, just a week after Solomon Islands announced it was breaking away from Taiwan. Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 when president Tsai Ing-wen was elected.\nThe move came as China has increased its focus on the Pacific and sought to peel off Taiwan\u2019s allies in the region.\nKiribati is thought to be of interest partly due to its location \u2013 some islands are just 700 km from US military installations \u2013 and also due to Christmas Island, the world\u2019s biggest atoll with a land mass of nearly 400 sq km. It lies just 2,150 km from Honolulu, home of the US Pacific Command and is far to the east of existing port facilities available to the Chinese navy.\nThe lightly populated island already has a giant deepwater pier and a spare runway, and its lagoon could easily be turned into a port, experts say.\n\u201cThe Chinese could design the project as being intended for cruise ships, and incrementally turn it into a dual-use facility that could service Chinese warships,\u201d said Patrick Buchan, who tracks China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nJames Fanell, a former director of intelligence of the Pacific Fleet, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to think they will be helping renovate port facilities and airfields in order to help the country develop,\u201d he said. \u201cBut having Chinese ships pull in at the big pier would be clearly threatening to Honolulu, no question.\u201d\nThe leader of the party that broke away from the government over its handling of the switch, Banuera Berina, is expected to be more sceptical in his dealings with China and to take a hard line against accepting loans. He and Maamau are expected to run in presidential elections due in June.\nBerina said that despite being the chairman of the ruling party when the diplomatic flip took place last fall, neither he nor a number of ministers were informed of what he later concluded were secret negotiations with the Chinese that must have gone on for months, if not years.\nHe recalled that when the president gathered the backbenchers and cabinet members to announce the switch as a fait accompli, several members protested that Taiwan and its ambassador were widely perceived as helpful and generous in their districts, and they feared losing their seats.\n\u201cBut the president assured us we shouldn\u2019t worry about that because we would be getting campaign money from China,\u201d he said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d Maamau has denied he ever said that; he did not respond to requests for comment.\nMaamau denied that the flip was plotted in secret, telling the Guardian: \u201cBefore the switch took place, consultations with party members, including MP Banuera, were done, and I had two sessions with our party members before they agreed to the switch.\u201d\nBenuera said the president had told the backbenchers that he made the switch because President Tsai Ing Wen had not proven to be a reliable partner.\nMaamau allegedly said Taiwan repeatedly ignored requests that it contribute to Kiribati\u2019s Vision 2020 development plan, centered on tourism and fisheries, notably by buying Kiribati a $30m Brazilian airliner. In March, when Tsai went on an official tour of the region, she also failed to visit Kiribati, which the government denounced as a snub.\n\u201cBased on my knowledge of Taiwan politics,\u201d said Natasha Kassam, who analyses Indo-Pacific strategy at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, \u201cthere\u2019s almost no scenario in which Tsai would have skipped a visit to Kiribati when in the region except for one where Maamau wasn\u2019t willing to entertain her.\u201d\nBanuera said he broke with Maamau when he found out from Taiwanese sources that in fact Tsai had been very eager to visit but was told it couldn\u2019t happen because Maamau would be in Fiji at the time.\n\u201cThe Taiwanese first offered to charter a plane so Maamau could get back in time, and when he refused, they even offered that President Tsai pick him up in Fiji on her way to Tarawa,\u201d he said.\nMaamau confirmed this but said it was a scheduling problem and both sides agree to hold the visit another time. None took place and Maamau announced the switch six months later.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry was contacted for comment.",

This brought us on a sunny Sunday morning to the foot of Wimble Holme Hill. The name is a delight: the root of Wimble has been offered as \u201cwime\u201d, a dialect word meaning to take a circuitous route. Streams wime. Bees wime. And when confronted with the alarmingly steep slope of Wimble Holme Hill, so do humans, who most usually take the narrow road that loops to the north at a more reasonable angle.\nWe, on the other hand, were up for a challenge and took the hill direct, which brought us immediately to a tangle of gorse. Here I stopped, not to catch my breath \u2013 we\u2019d hardly started \u2013 but to listen to the rasping call of a greenfinch.\nFor years, from one summer to the next, I would lie half-awake in the morning listening to this sound, like an elongated wheeze, emerging from a conifer outside my bedroom window: a lazy, delicious sound that encouraged me to stay just where I was. Then, around the middle of the past decade, my garden greenfinches, my confr\u00e8res in idleness, disappeared, presumably victims of the trichomonosis outbreak that caused such a precipitous decline in their numbers. And despite the recent recovery, they\u2019ve not returned to my garden yet. Summer hasn\u2019t been the same since.\nI could see why the greenfinches were thriving on Wimble Holme Hill. Plenty of cover, but also some benefactor had hung a couple of feeders from the bushes, crammed with sunflower seeds. Half-hidden behind the gorse was a circular wall of black bricks, the stub of what might have been a massive chimney but is, in fact, the opening of an airshaft to the railway tunnel that runs under Totley Moor.\nBuilt in the early 1890s, this huge project had its own story of sudden loss: the graveyard in nearby Dore has headstones to the victims of a smallpox outbreak that occurred among the navvies and their families during construction, unnamed victims of the march of progress. A railway tunnel might never wime, but the path of humans \u2013 and greenfinches \u2013 does little else.",

        "content": "Planned purchase by a private equity firm leads to worries that low-cost domain option could become prohibitively expensive\nWebsites using .org domain names fear they could lose their web addresses as intense backlash over the domain registry\u2019s proposed sale continues.\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), the not-for-profit organization that coordinates the internet\u2019s domain name system, is deciding whether control of .org will be sold to a private equity firm about which little is known.\nThe change of hands has raised concerns about censorship and how internet infrastructure affects free speech.\nWebsites using .org can be registered by anybody, but over the past decade the suffix has become the go-to domain term for not-for-profits and charities. The transfer of control of .org domains has left many concerned that a new owner could raise the price of addresses on the .org registry, making it prohibitively expensive for not-for-profits that have come to rely on its name recognition.\nThe not-for-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), along with the Domain Name Rights Coalition, Access Now, and others, wrote to Icann last week urging it to stop the sale.\n\u201cEssentially it means selling censorship,\u201d Mitch Stoltz, a senior staff attorney at EFF focusing on free speech and trademark issues, said of the sale. \u201cIt could mean suspending domain names, causing websites to go dark when some other powerful interest wants them gone.\u201d\nThese concerns were exacerbated when in 2019, Icann removed the cap on the price for a .org domain, having previously prohibited registrars from being charged more than $8.25.\nUntil now, .org has been managed by the not-for-profit Public Interest Registry (PIR) \u2013 created by the Internet Society exclusively for the purpose. Icann awarded control of .org to the Internet Society, another not-for-profit, in 2002.\nIcann is deciding if it will approve the sale of the domain registry to Ethos Capital, a private firm that emerged recently. Ethos has stated that it will keep prices low, but critics say because it is a for-profit company, it has no economic incentive to do so.\nIcann abruptly delayed its decision on Monday after receiving a scathing letter from the California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, on 15 April about the potential sale of .org.\nBecerra\u2019s letter came after not-for-profits and other internet freedom advocates said privatizing the domain registry would saddle it with more than $300m in debt.\nBecause Icann is incorporated in California, Becerra is in charge of ensuring it is \u201cliving up to its commitments\u201d. It will provide an update on 4 May.\n\u201cThere is mounting concern that ICANN is no longer responsive to the needs of its stakeholders,\u201d Becerra wrote.\nThe attorney general of Pennsylvania is also reportedly investigating the deal. Because PIR, the organization selling .org, is incorporated there, the state would have the power to stop it from happening.\nAndrew Sullivan, the CEO of the Internet Society, said those using the .org domain registry would be better served by Ethos, which would have more resources than a not-for-profit to fund them.\nHe noted that the firm had been making changes responsive to criticism about the potential sale. Commitments include a cap on price increases for eight years from the start of the current contract and a \u201cstewardship council\u201d that will have a say over policies affecting .org sites.\n\u201cThis shows Ethos is trying very hard to be a good steward of this resource,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman from Ethos also said the company is taking seriously critiques of the .org sale, citing the commitments it has made to address concerns. The company made a legally-binding commitment to limit the price increases to no more than 10% per year. There has also been a Stewardship Council created, which will have oversight and veto-power over PIR decisions to safeguard freedom of expression, protect customer data and information, and oversee anti-abuse policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that EFF and NTEN continue to spread misinformation about the transaction,\u201d the spokesman said.\nFormer members of Icann disagree. On Monday, its former CEO, Michael Roberts, and other former members wrote a letter criticizing the decision and imploring his successors to delay the transaction for six months.\n\u201cWe write to express our deep dismay at ICANN\u2019s rejection of its defining public-interest regulatory purpose as demonstrated in the totally inappropriate proposed sale of the .org delegation,\u201d they wrote. \u201cICANN has not meaningfully acted to address the likely proposed service cuts, increase in prices or trafficking of data of non-profits to obtain additional revenue.\u201d\nThe debate has taken on new life amid the coronavirus pandemic. Advocates for not-for-profits are concerned about the debt incurred by the sale as coronavirus creates economic uncertainty.\nIn his letter to Icann, Becerra said the $300m in debt will change the relationship .org has with its sites.\n\u201cIf the sale goes through and PIR\u2019s business model fails to meet expectations, it may have to make significant cuts in operations,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cSuch cuts would undoubtedly affect the stability of the .org registry.\u201d\nThis is of particular concern as not-for-profit sites have become more important than ever during the coronavirus pandemic, said Amy Sample Ward, CEO of the technology not-for-profit NTEN.\n\u201cMost of the entities leading in data and information aggregation, scientific investigation and developments, community resourcing and response are all non-profits with .org websites,\u201d she said. \u201cThose organizations also stand to lose a great deal if this deal proceeds.\u201d",

        "content": "Schools in northern Italy were the first in Europe to close. Since then, teachers, parents and kids across the country have all had to adapt to a new existence \u2013 and the results have surprised everyone. By Tobias Jones\nMost of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours \u2013 phone calls and messages flying around between friends \u2013 but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.\nThe decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed. I guessed it was because it wasn\u2019t perceived to be economically productive. Nothing else was closing: football grounds, bars, shops and ski resorts were still open for business, and no schools in any other European country had closed.\nStill, to our three kids \u2013 Benny (15), Emma (13) and Leo (9) \u2013 the idea of a week off seemed like bliss. We had moved back to Parma from the UK three years earlier, and by comparison with the UK, education here seemed relentless. Many pupils go to school six days a week and there are no half-term holidays. But my wife, Francesca, who is Italian, and I were both worried. She works with Syrian refugees, which isn\u2019t a job you can suddenly drop, and I had just been offered a 9-to-5 job, after 21 years of being freelance. We, like all our friends, suddenly had an acute childcare crisis.\nThe announcement had been so sudden that schools had few plans or resources in place to teach remotely. Italy spends a lot less on education than almost every other western country. Spending per student (from primary school to university) equates to $8,966 per annum, compared to $11,028 in the UK and $11,502 in Sweden. The under-investment is so serious that in December 2019, the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned in protest.\nNor did many Italian teachers seem to know how to approach this new world in which they found themselves. There is minimal teacher-training in Italy. University graduates are often thrown into a classroom without any knowledge of pedagogic theories or practical experience. Inspections are almost unheard of. The result is that Italian education is, at its worst, particularly conservative and condescending: the pupil is seen as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge that is regurgitated in exams.\nBecause of that lack of money, and because, according to the OECD, Italy has the oldest teachers in the world \u2013 59% are over 50 \u2013 Italian schools are heavily analogue. Kids carry a dozen books to and from school every day in massive backpacks, like Obelix and his rock, which did not seem like a promising basis for remote learning.\nBut if Italian schools weren\u2019t perfect, they were surely better than nothing. The idea that we now had to recreate formal education within the narrow walls of a city flat with no garden was daunting. We lacked the time, energy or even knowledge to replace their teachers. Nor, the kids made it clear, did they even want us to try.\nParents and teachers across the country had to scramble to devise ways continue our children\u2019s learning. But slowly \u2013 over the course of two months \u2013 something rather unexpected happened. As we started to ponder how this experiment of home schooling could best be delivered, it began to feel as if it was us, the parents and teachers, as much as the pupils, who were being educated.\nThe first week off school was the lull before the storm. It genuinely felt like a holiday. Being pragmatic and slightly puritan, we don\u2019t let the kids watch TV, or ourselves drink alcohol, on weekdays. When it was announced that school was closed, we lifted the rules. On 1 March, another week of school closures was announced, so we went up to the mountains, half an hour outside the city, to plant trees and play cards. On 4 March, a new government decree announced that every school in Italy would be suspended the following day.\nIn those early days it was all fun. I left the children spelling tests under their plates or pillows, and if they wanted to watch TV they had to learn elements of the periodic table or the bones of the human skeleton or how to tie knots. It felt as if we were, finally, the right side of that ancient Roman dichotomy of \u201cotium-negotium\u201d, an idea to which Italians occasionally refer. Otium was the time of creative repose when you were able to freewheel and follow your fancies \u2013 unlike negotium, which was all about business and the practical side of life.\nWe had a few advantages, I suppose. The ages of our kids mean that there are no tantrums at one end, and no alcohol or boyfriend issues at the other. We enjoy just hanging out together. I\u2019ve also spent much of my life teaching. I\u2019ve taught everywhere from primary schools to prisons and universities. For years, at home, we\u2019ve had mealtime quizzes. One Christmas, Benny even gifted the family three bells of the kind they have in hotel receptions so that we could truly have \u201cfingers on buzzers\u201d.\nThe few educational theories I have come from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who believed that play is the path to a child\u2019s wholeness and wellbeing. Games give children the chance to make decisions for themselves and provide an opportunity for spontaneity, fun, deceit and calculation. So for those first two weeks we played incessantly: perudo (\u201cliars\u2019 dice\u201d), blackjack, euchre, backgammon and epic table-tennis tournaments with various handicaps (playing left-handed or subtracting your age from your score). The kids weren\u2019t learning much, but at least poor old Leo was learning to be a good loser.\nBeing the youngest, he needed some fun, and since at this point his class had as yet no lessons organised, I asked his teacher if we could make 10-minute English lessons for his classmates. The aim was as much to cheer them up as to learn English. We would wear wigs and teach his peers the English names for body parts by sawing them off and using lots of fake blood. We taught grammar through declining lavatorial verbs. Emma would edit the videos and we would send them to the class WhatsApp group, which had, until now, been a basic tool for school admin and parental gossip.\nDespite all those good intentions, it was hard not to feel inadequate, even anxious. Well-meaning messages were circulating among parents about which museums, theatres, aquariums and zoos had opened their virtual doors. Many were posting pictures of their well-behaved children clicking their way through the Guggenheim, while ours were watching House on Netflix. We quickly felt defeated by the sheer volume of offerings, and guilty that we weren\u2019t sharing these cultural delights with our children.\nThe following weekend, on 8 March, the government announced that the whole of Emilia-Romagna (plus Lombardy and the Veneto) was to be placed in lockdown, and that schools would be closed for at least another month. Three days later, on 11 March, the entire country went into full lockdown.\nWe were slowly realising how dark things were becoming. On 12 March, we passed 1,000 nationwide deaths, and only four days later passed 2,000. There was defiance and denial as we sang on balconies and people hung out bedsheets with the wrong-headed slogan \u201candr\u00e0 tutto bene\u201d (\u201cit\u2019ll all be fine\u201d), but the mood was turning as the death toll continued to rise.\nIt was at this point that teachers dumped a load of homework on their pupils. Having had a fortnight to plan how to teach through the crisis, many decided that the best way was to send out entire chapters of books for children to learn, and hundreds of pages of exercises to complete. After a fortnight of freedom, pupils were now overloaded.\nThe other thing that changed was that my new job started. For the first time this century, I had bosses and meetings and responsibilities. It brought to an abrupt end my educational clowning. Suddenly no one in the family had much spare time and nor, it seemed, such good cheer.\nThe closing of all Italy\u2019s schools meant teachers found themselves having to invent a new kind of classroom from scratch. There were no ministerial guidelines or approved websites. \u201cThe entirety of this new form of online teaching,\u201d said Daniele Martino, a middle-school teacher in Turin, \u201cwas created by us teachers at the last minute.\u201d\nAt the beginning, it was chaotic. There was little coordination between different teachers within the same schools, let alone across different schools, and parents reported finding themselves boggled by a vast array of IT platforms: Meet, Classroom, Zoom, Jitsi, Edmodo. The problem wasn\u2019t only that sites and servers crashed as the country\u2019s almost 8 million students all logged on. Many kids couldn\u2019t connect at all.\nThe Digital Economy and Society Index rates Italy 24 out of 28 European countries in its \u201cdigitalisation index\u201d, and last year Italy\u2019s national statistics agency, Istat, reported that 23.9% of Italian families have no access to the internet. As one teacher said to me: \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered how democratic pencil-and-paper is.\u201d The attempt by many teachers to get less-privileged students the necessary laptops and internet connections is one of the untold stories of this crisis. By 19 March, the ministry of education claimed to have distributed 46,152 tablets throughout the country. Since then, an emergency budget has created a \u20ac70m fund for providing computers to those without. Even if the necessary hardware is distributed, one special educational needs teacher told me that online classes just don\u2019t work for children who need bespoke lessons: \u201cThose who are already doing well at school are now doing even better, but those who were struggling are just falling further behind.\u201d\nAt the start, I got the sense that no one really knew how to do what was becoming known as \u201cDAD\u201d \u2013 didattica a distanza, or long-distance learning. When teachers were struggling with IT, it was often their pupils who came to the rescue. \u201cI have an exceptional digital consultant\u201d, said Claudio Dionesalvi, a literature teacher in Calabria. \u201cHe\u2019s 11, and is one of my students. He\u2019s like a junior version of Mr Wolf in Pulp Fiction.\u201d\nThe teacher-pupil balance also shifted. In an online classroom, if pupils aren\u2019t interested or motivated, they can hide far more easily. They can feign technological issues, freeze the camera, mute the microphone. Around this time, I did a few online lessons for various schools and saw the problem close up: when the pupils weren\u2019t engaged they would drift away and, not having them there in front of you, you couldn\u2019t bring them back into the circle.\nTeachers were having to learn new ways to draw their students out. \u201cI could no longer do the classic head-on, knowledge-passing lesson,\u201d said Betta Salvini, a history teacher in Parma. \u201cI now involve them all the time, I turn the lesson upside down so that they are the protagonists, so that I hear their voices.\u201d\nBut school was also being reinvented because Italy\u2019s traditional educational stick had been removed. Usually pupils are given many tests each month and if, at the end of the year, their average score is insufficient, they\u2019re bocciato \u2013 failed \u2013 and have to repeat the year. Now, teachers quickly realised there was no way to stop students cheating in tests. When someone is in their bedroom, and all you can see is their face, you have no idea if they have the book open on their lap, or are messaging friends or Googling the answer.\nTraditionalist teachers were beside themselves. One parent in Umbria told me how a teacher stormed out of the virtual classroom when she discovered how many pupils were cheating. Then the new education minister, Lucia Azzolina, suggested that in the circumstances, no pupils would be sent back to repeat the year again. Between the cheating and the automatic promotion to the next school year, teachers who needed a big stick suddenly found themselves disarmed.\n\u201cMany of my colleagues are really struggling\u201d, said Riccardo Giannitrapani, a maths teacher in a secondary school in Udine. These two months, he told me, have been more about a re-education of teachers than of pupils. \u201cBefore, we used to discuss students in meetings by giving them numbers, even down to decimal points \u2013 5.4, 5.5.\u201d These marks, he said, became an end in themselves, creating acute anxiety among not only the children, but also their parents.\nThere has always been a battle in Italy between hardliners and child-centred reformers such as Maria Montessori. It now seemed as if progressives had the upper hand. Salvatore Giuliano, a headteacher in Brindisi and a former deputy education minister, told me: \u201cA child of 15 has far more creativity than we have. Every time you give them the freedom and tools to create something, they will astonish you.\u201d Giuliano described some memorable student-led presentations he has seen in recent weeks. His favourite was an extended family \u2013 parents, siblings and grandparents \u2013 all dressed up as the planets and moving around the room.\nMany teachers have had to soften their approach, to take into account what their pupils were going through. \u201cSome of them have lost a grandparent\u201d, said Paola Lante, a primary-school teacher in Milan. \u201cTheir parents are losing their jobs or are fighting at home. At the end of the day, a teacher has to be a steadying influence, a social worker and a psychologist.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the lockdown, Giannitrapani, the maths teacher in Udine, published an open letter to his pupils saying that he shouldn\u2019t be the one overloading them, but vice versa \u2013 they should be bombarding him with their questions. Sara Scotellaro, in Naples, has 120 pupils in various classes: \u201cThey no longer have a timetable and you have to be constantly available\u201d, she said. \u201cThey have this need to be immediately reassured \u2013 that their work has been received, that it\u2019s OK, that you\u2019re happy with them.\u201d\nThat fluidity of boundaries has had advantages and disadvantages. In video lessons some pupils have found it embarrassing to share their personal spaces \u2013 their bedrooms and, in the background, even their embarrassing parents. Many teachers describe seeing a new side to their students. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer the intimidation of the pack,\u201d said one teacher, \u201cand so they\u2019re bringing out what they really know. I\u2019ve got a 13-year-old, the son of two ex-offenders, who has produced some diaries of extraordinary depth.\u201d Lante told me about a very timid student who never speaks in class but who, it only now emerges, is exceptional at languages. \u201cIt makes you understand\u201d, said Lante, \u201cthat we need a very varied form of education\u201d.\nBy the third week of March, after a month with no school, Francesca and I were also beginning to see our children in a new light. Like most kids, they\u2019re monosyllabic when describing their days at school \u2013 \u201cfine\u201d usually does it. Now, as lessons were literally taking place in the kitchen, we were unexpectedly in the classroom with them. We could see what was going on.\nIt was both painful and funny. We realised that one of our children, exuberant and confident at home, often froze when asked a question in class. Another, usually conscientious and honest, was asked by her teacher to show her artwork. Because it hadn\u2019t turned out too well, she held up her drawing up against the window, and held the painting she was supposed to have copied behind it, so it showed through behind her own. That mini-deceit made her work look rather sophisticated.\nAnother consequence of lessons taking place at home was that the greatest problem in schools \u2013 boisterous disturbances \u2013 suddenly subsided. One of our children has a class that is usually very noisy: the kids misbehave and the teacher yells, and soon everyone is shouting over each other. Now, with the children subdued by their parents\u2019 presence, and the teacher aware that parents could be listening, there was a new-found calm to the lessons and, we thought, a genuine warmth to the encounters.\nBut there was no timetable to our children\u2019s lessons. There were odd hours here and there, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes mid-afternoon. Our elderly laptops and wifi were often inadequate, and so the only working devices were passed around. There wasn\u2019t a lot of rhythm or relaxation to our day. Francesca and I were still trying to take up a lot of slack, but as March turned into April, our initial energy had subsided.\nWe had passed 10,000, then 15,000 deaths from Covid-19. Even though the kids had enough spare time to be habitually bored, they were no longer cleaning the house or doing their daily learning tasks. Spelling tests and fitness regimes were forgotten. They seemed to have become \u2013 if not agoraphobic \u2013 certainly \u201cagora-meh\u201d. They wouldn\u2019t even walk around the block. They were getting up later each day, and even when vertical, it became hard to persuade them to get out of pyjamas.\nAs often happens when you stop doing something, you suddenly wonder why you were doing it in the first place. Benny, who has been obsessive about ballet all her life and attends a dance academy, entered a profound crisis. She said she wanted to stop dancing altogether. Even Leo, a football fanatic, barely mentioned or played with a football any more. It felt as if their passions had evaporated somehow.\nIt\u2019s hard, as a parent, not to be frustrated, especially if \u2013 as a writer \u2013 you regret that they never read books. Every time I emerged from my office, I would see them all on their screens, headphones on. Lessons had become indistinguishable from down-time. For all the idealism about digital learning, it seemed extraordinarily passive to me.\nI tried to take things in hand. Mealtimes were raucous because they had so much pent-up energy, so I thought \u201cif they\u2019re not going to read, I\u2019ll read to them\u201d. I would bring a book to table, not realising that I was becoming just like one of the conservative teachers I had always scorned, force-feeding them my passions and using knowledge to sedate and subdue. They would snigger and scoff. \u201cI just don\u2019t get poetry,\u201d Emma grumbled.\nFortunately they have a wiser mother. We have no garden, but four balconies, and as spring came on, Francesca was planting and weeding. The children were drawn to the gardening, perhaps because it was everything their schooling isn\u2019t \u2013 outdoors and manual. Emma propagated her succulents and so needed more shelf space, and went to the garage to do some carpentry. They began sewing, and cooking cappelletti, croissants and \u2013 their much-missed English snack \u2013 digestive biscuits.\nIt\u2019s hard to know how much it was more to do with psychology or spare time, but they all began rearranging their bedrooms, moving beds and desks. It was as if they were rearranging their internal and external furniture. Photographs, pictures and books were culled, others were added. They asked for new haircuts. Francesca and I watched it all and tried to work out ways to keep bringing them out of both their closed bedrooms and their private worlds.\nI changed my approach. I know that theatricality is sometimes helpful in teaching, so one evening, as I read a poem, I put a small shiny box on the table. They pretended to listen, but were all watching that box, wondering what the game was. I had chosen to read Seamus Heaney\u2019s Digging. It\u2019s a poem about how we look up to, and down on, our parents. It\u2019s about the difficulty of a writer feeling worthy of agricultural ancestors because the pen is nothing compared with the depth of a spade. But it\u2019s also about the need for children to go their own way and not, perhaps, feel unworthy. When I had finished, I just passed them the box. Inside I had cut up all the words of the poem. \u201cGo on then,\u201d I said, \u201cwrite it your way.\u201d\nSuddenly they were excited about poetry. They snatched words from each other, tried them out here and there. As they laughed, the slim pieces of paper flew around the table. With its farmyard diction \u2013 \u201csquelch\u201d, \u201cslap\u201d, \u201crump\u201d \u2013 the poem now seemed earthy rather than erudite. Instead of being told to admire a Grecian urn, they now had the clay in their hands.\nAs they found their new hybrid role of being both pupils and teachers, we said they could award themselves marks both for content (a letter) and effort (a number). It was really, of course, just a way to show them that marks aren\u2019t about approval (external) but honesty (internal).\nThe more you look at the educational conundrum in lockdown Italy, the more you see everyone\u2019s vulnerabilities. Students have always felt fretful because of their weekly tests and the stigma of being held back a year. But now many teachers feel insecure, too: not just because education seems like the last priority of government, but because they are scared of digitalised learning and fear being replaced by screens.\nEven those who relish the technology, like the Calabrian teacher Claudio Dionesalvi, are concerned: \u201cDistance-learning is a strange video game,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the end it\u2019s a torture. A teacher can\u2019t be holed up in front of a screen. They risk becoming two-dimensional \u2013 an artificial TV personality.\u201d\nMany parents are anxious, not just because their children are losing out on formative months of learning, but also because \u2013 without those marks \u2013 they have no measure of their offspring\u2019s progress. Chiara Esposito, a middle-school teacher, told me \u201cparents are the most conservative element in the school ecosystem. They become paranoid if their child isn\u2019t \u2018an eight\u2019 or hasn\u2019t completed the set book. They\u2019re the ones we really need to educate.\u201d\nSurprisingly, even the education technology firms promoting digital learning platforms to schools feel apprehensive. Lorenzo Benussi is the chief innovation officer of the Fondazione per la Scuola della Compagnia di San Paolo, which promotes inclusivity and creativity in education, and a former technical adviser to the minister of education. He is concerned that teachers are using new tech to reproduce the same old teaching methods, instead of grasping this opportunity for a completely new kind of teaching. \u201cWhen all this talk about digital learning began back in March,\u201d he said, \u201cI was very, very worried, because it\u2019s not about technology. Technology is just a means. Its effectiveness depends entirely on your didactic approach.\u201d\nEdoardo Montenegro from Betwyll, which is launching a new social reading app with educational publisher Pearson for Italian schools in September, says something very similar: \u201cA WhatsApp video call or a Zoom meeting isn\u2019t digital learning. Those encounters can be just as frontal and rhetorical as an old-style professorial lesson.\u201d\nNo one knows when formal schooling will resume, and everyone feels uncertain of what their role will be when it does. But uncertainty is, according to the great educationalist Loris Malaguzzi, actually a vital ingredient for inclusive, collegiate learning. Only \u201ca willingness to question all your own abilities and knowledge\u201d, he said in 1992, two years before his death, leads to humility and listening. That, he said, \u201cis how we educate each other together.\u201d\nIt\u2019s exactly two months since the schools closed in Emilia-Romagna. And to us, in our city apartment, it does feel as if, in the gentle argy-bargy of family life, we\u2019ve been educating each other. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it\u2019s changed how we see ourselves. The girl destined to be a ballerina seems to be mourning the end of that dream. The perfectionist has glimpsed a goal that\u2019s deeper than marks out of 10. The boy who seemed riotous has been revealed as nervously studious. The teacher has become an accompanist and the gardener our guide. And with almost five months to go until schools (possibly) reopen in mid-September, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve still got a lot to learn.\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

        "content": "Families are using technology to keep things \u2018normal\u2019 during the pandemic but questions remain about what remote learning can teach us\nSocial distancing measures and the subsequent shift to remote working, socializing and school led to questions about the technology available to us, namely Zoom, which was labelled a \u201cprivacy disaster\u201d. Yet amid the challenges of implementing technology into our home lives, families are having to embrace technology to keep things \u201cnormal\u201d, and finding increasingly creative ways to stay organized and educated online along the way.\n\u201cPeople who never expected \u2013 nor ever wanted \u2013 to use digital technology to communicate or work now must, and so they are learning how,\u201d explains Sean Michael Morris, director of the Digital Pedagogy Lab at the University of Colorado Denver. \u201cWe could look at this integration of technologies into family life in a positive light, in that the use of these technologies at home necessitates a new level of digital literacy for everyone, but there\u2019s an equally important downside to the movement of work-related technologies into home life, too. Technology is useful, but it is not a substitute for the classroom.\u201d\nWhere the gaps between classroom learning and homeschooling are most apparent a wave of apps aimed at supporting remote learning have risen to prominence. Seesaw, which allows students to build a digital portfolio of work to share with parents or teachers, has seen a tenfold increase in usage since US schools began to shut down in March.\n\u201cThere are two types of technologies that have been particularly powerful during this time,\u201d explains Seesaw Co-Founder Adrian Graham. \u201cThe first is live video calling such as Zoom. The second is technology that supports activities that enable personalized attention for students, even in the midst of so many of our routines being disrupted. Often kids are \u2018parked\u2019 in front of technology as a passive solitary experience, but I hope people start to see the immense learning potential that technology has to enable kids to express their thinking and then receive feedback from people who care about them.\u201d\nAlthough technology that is specifically catered to remote learning such as Seesaw has seen significant interest, there has also been widespread repurposing of traditionally workplace-based technologies. The meteoric popularity of Zoom is one example, but Trello, a work management tool for organizing projects, also saw a 73% increase in sign-ups in March compared to last year. The company credits a substantial portion of this to its decision to provide free access to its premium package to educators in order to help combat the challenges of school closures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that parents are now serving as the only direct touchpoint that teachers have with younger students. Trello is being used as the central hub to share assignments, attach proof of work and leave comments and questions,\u201d says Michael Pryor, founder and head of Trello at Atlassian. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from teachers that they started using Trello because they found themselves thrown into this situation, but they plan to keep it up in the long run.\u201d\nTrello is already beginning to plan for a more multipurpose future, currently working on perfecting a new template gallery for teachers and parents, and adding integrations to enable users to customize lesson plans and workflow. For parents and teachers now communicating with their students digitally the rethinking of existing technology for use in an education setting is important, but questions remain about what remote learning can teach us about schooling more broadly.\n\u201cIf any time is the best time to reinvent \u2018school\u2019 for the better, this time certainly has given us the impetus and rationale and taken away any excuses built on a narrative that \u2018this is how it has to be because this is the way we\u2019ve always done it\u2019,\u201d says Sarojani S Mohammed, Founder of research group Ed Research Works. \u201cI think that there\u2019s an opportunity here to collectively see and experience how personalized learning and true learner-centered instruction can be accomplished. Parents should consider technology to be a tool for interactive learning, for socializing and for social-emotional health and wellbeing at this time. 2020 is illustrating to us what the true non-negotiables are in our conventional education systems, what our critical goals are for learners and alternatively where we do, in fact, have room to innovate.\u201d\nYet in addition to forcing educators and parents to consider how technology can better support education, the sudden shift to remote learning has also exposed profound problems. The expectation on parents to provide adequate time and technology to educate their children lays bare vast economic divides, and many families may be concerned by the impact of remote schooling on their child\u2019s educational development as well as their ability to focus on their own work.\n\u201cIf there are any technologies that will remain useful once we go back to the classroom, I think they will be those which helped us stay in touch with one another, and those that could best provide equitable access to the most marginalized,\u201d says Morris. \u201cToo many students are without internet at home, or adequate enough broadband to be able to participate in school. Too many families can\u2019t afford computers or mobile devices. The pivot to remote learning has surfaced inequalities that, though already present, were not highlighted by classroom-based education. I think the best technological innovation or change that should come next would come as a result of looking carefully at issues of equity and either redesigning existing technologies, or revisiting the whole endeavor.\u201d\nFor many, the future of technology in education does not rely solely on creating new, exciting and innovative tools, but in thinking about how technology can make digital learning safe, accessible and equal for all. The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated how important technology can be in times of change and uncertainty. The next test for educators and technology companies will be utilizing and shaping digital tools to make the opportunities that they offer equally available to all, inside as well as outside the classroom.",

In Scotland, the government has announced a \u00a35m package of emergency financial support.\nBut according to a survey by the National Union of Students (NUS), 80% of students across the UK are worried about how they will cope financially after losing work and support from their parents.\nThe NUS has called on the government to supply a \u00a360 million hardship fund that would provide students with a \u201csafety net\u201d during the coronavirus lockdown. The NUS also demanded that universities reimburse students\u2019 tuition fees and allow them to retake the year to make up for the disruption to their degrees.\nThis has been echoed by cross-party MPs, who have asked the chancellor to set up emergency maintenance grants for those who are not entitled to claim universal credit.\nLily Taylor, a master\u2019s student at Sheffield Hallam University, lives off \u00a390 a week after being furloughed from her bar job, along with her savings that will run out soon. \u201cThe hardest part is having no space to study,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the house I rent we have a high-up dining table with stools. I have a bad back after an accident a couple of years ago and I can\u2019t sit here for longer than 20 minutes without it being a strain.\u201d\nTaylor tried asking her university if it could supply her with a desk chair. She was told to apply for the university\u2019s hardship fund, but says her application was denied. \u201cI\u2019m stuck on my own in Sheffield, 160 miles away from my friends and family, and I\u2019m worried about how I\u2019m going to be able to complete my dissertation.\u201d\nSheffield Hallam has launched a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for struggling students after its usual hardship fund was overwhelmed by requests from students as a result of the pandemic.\nSimilar measures have been announced by the University of York and the University of Greenwich. Greenwich has also offered free laptops and broadband for students and staff, while students at the University of Loughborough can request free meals if they are struggling to cope financially while stranded on campus.\nBut students will need to meet certain eligibility criteria to receive support. Sophie Cartwright, a master\u2019s student, applied for the University of Birmingham\u2019s hardship fund after losing her income from three part-time jobs. Although she comes from a single-parent, lower socioeconomic background, she says she doesn\u2019t meet requirements.\n\u201cThe university requires any postgraduate applicant to have a minimum average of \u00a3180 a week in income throughout the academic year in order to even apply to the fund. This is extremely counterintuitive as it means those who most need the financial support are immediately not eligible,\u201d she says.\nSome students who have lost their jobs were employed by universities themselves \u2013 in campus shops or student unions, for example \u2013 and are frustrated by the lack of clarity around the future of their employment.\nIssy Emmitt, a third-year student at the University of Bath, was working two jobs on campus before the outbreak, as both a student ambassador and in the campus supermarket. When the lockdown began, she and other student employees were informed via a Facebook page that there was no more work available at the shop.\n\u201cThose of us working zero-hour contracts on campus still haven\u2019t been told whether or not we have been officially furloughed or just plain fired yet \u2013 four weeks on,\u201d she says. \u201cA coursemate of mine lost three campus jobs and estimates her losses to be already around \u00a31,000.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Emmitt is worried about how she will pay rent. \u201cI have no savings because of how expensive living in Bath is, and so I\u2019m suddenly in a position where I not only can\u2019t afford my rent, but even basic living necessities,\u201d she says. \u201cI also can\u2019t move home at the moment as my father is severely immunocompromised.\u201d\nRent is a major concern for hard-pressed students. Nearly 75,000 students have signed a petition for universities to suspend all student accommodation rent for those who have returned home due to Covid-19.\nMany universities have waived rent for the final term of the year, and some for the whole year. But according to the Office for Students, only 19% of students live in university accommodation, with the vast majority renting from private providers. In some cases, students stranded in their housing without an income have organised rent strikes.\nFor students like Cartwright, the financial pressures may be too much. \u201cIf I do not receive additional support, I will likely not be able to finance somewhere in Birmingham to live for the remainder of my degree,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to afford a deposit or save up rent upfront for the new property. Due to the hands on nature of my degree, I need to be in Birmingham to complete my dissertation. I do not wish to drop out, but this is something I\u2019m unfortunately forced to consider.\u201d\nSome names have been changed",

        "content": "Suspension leaves London firm unable to pay bills and sparks concerns of anti-Iran bias\nA bank has been accused of potentially putting people\u2019s health at risk during the coronavirus crisis by freezing an NHS pharmacy\u2019s business account with no explanation, leaving it unable to pay suppliers.\nThe co-owner of NDY Peters Pharmacy in Marylebone, central London, said the firm\u2019s staff were working on the NHS frontline, helping patients and the community, but added: \u201cAt this moment we are struggling \u2026 we are very worried about the shop.\u201d\nNeda, who did not wish to disclose her surname, said she and her husband discovered on 2 March that Metro Bank had frozen the shop\u2019s business account, which they use to pay their pharmaceutical suppliers, staff wages, utility bills, rent and other costs. It has more than \u00a310,000 in it, which they now cannot access.\nShe said she believed the bank had suspended the account \u201cbecause of our ethnicity and where we come from\u201d. Her parents are Iranian, though they moved to Europe about 40 years ago and have lived in the UK for 20 years. Neda was born in Italy and has visited Iran several times.\nIn recent years, several UK banks have been accused of conducting purges of customers who have links to certain countries, and last month Metro Bank was hit with a lawsuit by a group of Iranian customers who said their accounts were unfairly suspended without notice or explanation.\nThe personal Metro Bank accounts of Neda and her mother, who is a director of the pharmacy, were frozen on the same day as the business account, and it had already suspended Neda\u2019s husband\u2019s personal account.\nNeda said: \u201cAs a pharmacy we have responsibility towards our patients for their medications. We are working every day as NHS frontline \u2026 but we need our banking facility to be in good order to continue to do so.\n\u201cWe could not pay our staff until now, and they are kind enough to work during this situation. However, we have managed to borrow money at least to pay our suppliers so we can order medications and carry on opening our pharmacy on a daily basis.\u201d\nNeda said a pharmacy was clearly a vital business during the pandemic, and added: \u201cThis could put people\u2019s lives at risk ... We are struggling as a business already. We have to keep it open \u2026 we work for the NHS.\u201d\nThe affected accounts were opened in late 2018, and Neda said there was no apparent reason why the bank would take such tough action: \u201cThis is a pharmacy \u2013 there haven\u2019t been any weird transactions coming in from the Middle East.\u201d\nNeda said because of its location in the capital, the pharmacy had been heavily affected by the lockdown \u2013 many of its customers are passing tourists and others from overseas, including embassy staff.\nThe Guardian reported last month that the Metro Bank lawsuit involved a group of 17 claimants who were expected to seek at least \u00a31.5m in damages, with any potential trial expected to take place in 2021.\nIn recent years, the Guardian has featured a number of cases of banks allegedly dumping customers they view as having links to countries about which they have concerns. This controversial practice is known in the industry as \u201cde-risking\u201d.\nIn 2016, the Financial Conduct Authority said it had become aware that banks were withdrawing banking facilities from customers \u2013 or failing to offer them in the first place \u2013 in greater numbers than before.\nIt said there was a perception that this was driven by lenders\u2019 concerns about the money laundering and terrorist financing risks posed by certain types of customer. Iran may be viewed as problematic because of the sanctions imposed on it by the US.\nCommenting on the case, a Metro Bank spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry to hear about this situation and apologise for the inconvenience this is causing. We never take a decision to suspend a customer\u2019s account lightly, however the steps we have taken are required in line with our terms and conditions, and we are undertaking our review as quickly as we are able to do so.\u201d",

        "content": "Residents of Western Isles, which have yet to record a Covid-19 death, have plenty experience of isolation\nResidents of the Outer Hebrides are experts at surviving through harsh weather, cancelled ferries and social isolation. And it seems to have paid off, after it emerged that the islands may be the only area of the UK where no one has yet died from Covid-19.\nUnlike Scotland\u2019s other island groups, such as Orkney and Shetland, the Western Isles have had remarkably few confirmed cases: so far, only six people out of a population of nearly 27,000 are known to have contracted coronavirus.\nOfficial data confirmed this week that for 13 days there had been no new cases in the Western Isles, an archipelago that stretches from Lewis and Harris through the Uists and Benbecula down to Barra and Mingulay at its southern tip.\nThe remarkable figures suggest an early decision by Scottish ministers to begin restricting all non-essential ferry travel, alongside issuing urgent appeals for city dwellers to stay away from the highlands and islands, may have paid off.\nCalMac and NorthLink, the country\u2019s main ferry operators, started preventing holidaymakers and non-residents from using their ferries from 19 March, the day before the UK and Scottish governments ordered the nationwide lockdown, and on 27 March they introduced an emergency timetable.\nOnly essential workers and lorry drivers have been allowed to travel since then. On Easter Sunday this year, only 146 people used Hebridean ferries, compared with 12,000 people on Easter Sunday last year. CalMac\u2019s traffic has fallen by 95%.\nDr Alasdair Allan, the Scottish National party MSP for the Western Isles, Na h-Eileanan an Iar in Scottish Gaelic, cautioned that many more cases on the islands might have gone undetected, but said islanders were quick to embrace the lockdown.\n\u201cPeople on the islands were instantly aware of how dangerous that was because they knew their health services couldn\u2019t cope with that situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a high degree of compliance despite the fact that the effects economically are very precarious, for areas with a seasonal economy.\u201d\nOrkney and Shetland have had a tougher experience: official data from National Records of Scotland (NRS) shows that Shetland has had six deaths since the outbreak began, a rate of 2.6 people per 10,000 population, and 52 confirmed infections. Orkney has recorded two deaths, a rate of 0.9 per 10,000, yet has only had six confirmed infections. Alongside the Western Isles, it was the last place in Scotland to record a new infection, on 8 April.\nNRS data suggests the lockdown has protected other parts of rural Scotland too. The Highland region has had 50 deaths, but at 1.6 per 10,000, and the death rate in Grampian, which includes the Cairngorms, Speyside and Aberdeen, is 1.5 per 10,000.\nBy contrast, the rate in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which has the country\u2019s most deprived and closely packed populations, is at 4.4 per 10,000 and at 3.5 per 10,000 in Lanarkshire.\nThe Western Isles figures were highlighted because of a mistake that briefly caused alarm on the islands. After a patient died in Stornoway\u2019s hospital from suspected Covid-19, that was put on his death certificate. But a test sample came back negative from Glasgow and the NHS board has asked for the NRS to change its records to record zero coronavirus deaths in the Western Isles.\nGordon Jamieson, chief executive of NHS Western Isles, said it planned to greatly increase testing with a new machine that is expected to become operational on Monday, allowing it to test for the virus more widely among key workers and in the community. \u201cI can fight it much better that way,\u201d he said.\nIt has allocated 60 \u201csurge\u201d beds for Covid-19 cases and capacity for eight intensive care patients in Stornoway \u2013 capacity that has not yet been needed, according to Jamieson. Their testing in the community suggested that, so far, the virus had not yet established itself.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re living in fairly remote island communities, you find that people come to terms and adjust very rapidly to anything that happens up here,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very beginning there was an immediate and very high level of compliance with social distancing and with staying at home. It has been clear and it has been consistent; people have been very disciplined, and supportive and cooperative.\u201d\nAllan remained cautious, however. He hoped greater testing would confirm that the lockdown has worked. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody here is complacent about the possibility that we may just be at an early stage here. We might just be one of the last places in Europe to be affected. I\u2019m hoping with more testing in the few days, we will get a complete picture of that.\u201d\nShetland has had a similar response from its residents. Past experience with infectious diseases, such as the recent swine flu outbreak and tuberculosis many decades ago, meant many islanders had voluntarily locked down early on.\nDr Susan Bowie, a GP In Hillswick, a village in the far north-west of mainland Shetland, said her community self-isolated as soon as they heard the virus had arrived, earlier than in other parts of Scotland. Hillswick is 43 miles (69km) along difficult roads from the islands\u2019 only hospital, in Lerwick, increasing the sense of vulnerability.\nPreparing for bad weather is instinctive. \u201cPeople have been amazing at self-isolating, and they went into self-isolation at least two weeks before the rest of the UK,\u201d she said. Her neighbours \u201ckeep a lot of full freezers. We always have quite a lot in the larder.\u201d\n This article was amended on 24 April 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly gave the fatality rates in percentages for Greater Glasgow and Clyde (4.4%), and Lanarkshire (3.5%).

        "content": "Workers in a sector with a history of exploitation face hazards including a lack of masks and overcrowded accommodation\nIn Sri Lanka, police have been enforcing tough lockdown measures and a strict curfew since March. The country\u2019s inspector general has instructed police to take action against social media users who criticise the government or spread \u201cmalicious\u201d pandemic information.\nAn exception has been made, however, for the country\u2019s tea pickers. A caveat on the country\u2019s lockdown order, issued on 20 March, read: \u201cPaddy farming and plantation, including work on tea small holdings and fishing activities, are permitted in any district.\u201d\nThe Ceylon Workers\u2019 Red Flag Union say coronavirus public health measures mean little on estates. There are no facilities to wash hands with soap during a shift and masks are not always issued, even though it has been mandatory to wear them in public since early April.\nSome workers have bought their own masks. Others improvise with handkerchiefs and serviettes. Where companies provide a cloth mask, the cost can be deducted from wages. In the humidity and heat, Red Flag has observed women constantly touching their faces to wipe away sweat. The union is concerned that, without health education, the masks may not be washed daily or used correctly.\nA pressing concern is living conditions. Accommodation on tea estates generally consists of overcrowded, tin-roofed \u201cline rooms\u201d, usually five consecutive rooms in long rows. Each 30-square-metre room is a household, making social distancing impossible. Toilets are sometimes communal.\nBecause of the curfew, partners and children working and living in urban areas have been returning, so rooms are more overcrowded. Where household members work in neighbouring estates, cross-area infection is a risk.\nWith the political environment ominous \u2013 Human Rights Watch fears the country may be using the pandemic to curtail free speech \u2013 the critical voice of plantation trade unions has played a vital role in fighting deepening inequalities in a semi-feudal sector with a long history of exploitation.\nTea, along with rubber and coconut, is among the country\u2019s leading exports. The plantation system, devised by British colonialists in the 1820s, was run with an indentured workforce, uprooted from India\u2019s Tamil Nadu. The population of about 840,000 people only gained Sri Lankan citizenship in 2003.\nToday, the work remains physically demanding, with poverty and debt bondage weighing heavily on estate communities. Smallholder tea farms, a more recent development dating back to the 70s and 80s, are believed to offer better working conditions.\nThe labour force, consisting predominantly of women from the island\u2019s \u201cplantation Tamil\u201d communities, is marked by social exclusion and grinding poverty.\nDemonstrations by civil society groups last year highlighted the chronic immiseration of tea workers, with protesters asking for a doubling of the minimum wage to 1,000 rupees a day (\u00a34.22). And ethical brands do not guarantee better pay.\nA 2019 investigation by the Thomson Reuters Foundation found take-home wages in some tea estates certified by Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade were as little as 26 rupees a day (\u00a30.11) after the deduction of debt repayments, salary advances and other fees.\nWith the pandemic curfew, even basic foods such as rice and lentils have been scarce, and women are struggling more than ever to maintain the health of their households\nMalnutrition was identified by a 2017 World Bank study as a significant problem for women and children on plantations.\nReports of domestic violence and child abuse have also risen during the curfew.\nRed Flag has been in negotiations with the Sri Lanka State Plantations Cooperation (SLSPC) to make sure the health of plantation workers is prioritised. Using daily updates from its local representatives, the union is trying to resolve problems quickly and successfully intervened over salary payments after some estates delayed paying wages.\n\u201cWe have written to the president demanding that workers get paid 25 days of salary for two months, regardless of whether they are working or not,\u201d said Menaha Kandasamy, an adviser to Red Flag.\nDilhan Fernando, chief executive of ethical tea company Dilmah, says the business has implemented several safeguarding measures, including social distancing, ensuring access to hand washing, food and medicines and paying employees a bonus of one month\u2019s salary.\nFernando said all tea pluckers are given a mask, while factory workers are provided with masks, gloves and sanitiser. Despite a lack of evidence, workers are being advised to gargle with salt water. Fernando described how \u201ceducation on the critical importance of the precautions as well as daily disinfection in and around the accommodation and production areas is carried out\u201d.\nSLSPC was asked to respond to questions on line rooms, hand washing and masks on their estates. They said that they have advised that workers wear face masks, keep a distance and drink Sri Lankan black tea, and that temperatures be checked at daily muster.\n This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to add a comment from SLSPC and to credit Red Union Flag for the photographs.\n Yasmin Gunaratnam is a reader in sociology at Goldsmith\u2019s College, University of London.

An expression of interest campaign lasting three weeks started on Tuesday.\nVirgin chief executive Paul Scurrah, who remains in his job during the administration, said the board\u2019s decision to place the company in administration came after the federal government knocked back a final plea for $200m in assistance \u2013 far less than a loan of $1.4bn the airline initially requested.\nIn an affidavit filed with the court, Strawbridge said the airline\u2019s business was hit hard by a series of travel restrictions imposed by state and federal governments last month in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHe said the administrators had so far identified about 10,200 creditors, including about 9,000 employees who are owed about $450m.\n\u201cThe administrators expect that the total number of creditors is estimated to be over 12,000,\u201d he said.\nHe said 26 secured corporate debt and aircraft finance lenders were owed about $2.28bn.\nMore than 1,000 trade creditors are owed $166m and a group of 81 landlords are owed $71m.\nAbout 50 companies from which the airline has leased 94 planes are owed $1.88bn.\nUnsecured bondholders, who have the most vulnerable position, are owed close to $2bn, but Strawbridge did not say how many there were.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nCorrespondence filed with the court shows some aircraft leasing companies raised concerns that they would not be paid for the use of a handful of planes that remain in service.\nNormally, the administrators would be personally responsible for the leases from next Tuesday.\nHowever, Middleton\u2019s order means this personal liability begins instead on 26 May.\n\u201cAt present, the administrators have been unable (and will, before 28 April 2020, not have been able) to form a view as to whether it is necessary or desirable, in the interests of preserving the value of the business, to exercise rights over the leases,\u201d Strawbridge said in his affidavit.",

Sledging the England team has its drawbacks after all.\u2019\n\u2018Ronan O\u2019Rahilly, who has died aged 79 after suffering from dementia, was the Irish maverick who took on the British political and broadcasting establishments by launching the UK\u2019s first offshore pirate station, Radio Caroline, on Easter Sunday 1964.\u2019\n\u2018He is George, England\u2019s hero and a symbol of pride and patriotism as the nation\u2019s patron saint. In reality he was born in what is now Turkey, died in modern-day Israel and never even considered stepping foot in England.\u2019\n\u2018Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor could be heard calling for help before Richard Pusey began filming the crash, Melbourne magistrate\u2019s court was told on Friday.\u2019\n\u2018It\u2019s so unnecessary for Tucci to be banging his cocktail shaker down with the force that he does. But he does it anyway, only adding to the sense that his arms could squeeze all the loneliness out of you. It also adds to the sense of confidence he exudes throughout.\u2019\n\u2018In the real world, people are strange and confusing. In Titanic they\u2019re not. The good people are the poor ones who appreciate painting and dancing. The bad people are the rich ones who disapprove of Picasso and have never heard of Freud. As with many inherently conservative films, it likes to think of itself as siding with the radicals and underdogs.\u2019\n\u2018\u201cI wanted to crush him,\u201d said Carlsen afterwards, using the c-word which was also a favourite of the legendary crushers Bobby Fischer and Judit Polgar. The champion dominated the play and showed a higher level of understanding in the first three games.\u2019",

        "content": "The artist reflects on the events that inspired Hampstead theatre\u2019s #aiww: The Arrest of Ai Weiwei, streamed by the Guardian this month\nYou began an 81-day confinement on 3 April 2011. What happened that day?That day, I woke up and prepared to go to the airport with my assistant Jennifer, who had begun working with me not long before. This was our first trip together and we were going to go to Taiwan to prepare for an exhibition opening later that autumn. Our flight was to Hong Kong where we would transfer to Taipei. \n  Many things happened in the days before the trip. I had been under surveillance and followed by secret police for years, but the days before the trip involved more frequent visits. There were all kinds of excuses: a fire safety check, residential registrations, many strange reasons that had not been used before. I could sense something was coming, but I could never have imagined what would happen. They could have come to my home in Beijing to see me and take me away if they had wanted to. They could have come and questioned me at any time, but they never directly confronted me. When we approached the immigration checkpoint that day, I knew something was going to happen. A police officer took my passport and I saw the other police gathered in the hall begin moving toward me. Another police officer came and told me he had something to discuss. I followed him into another room. From there, I was led to a car, a black hood was put over my head and I was driven to an unknown area. That was the beginning of 81 days of solitary confinement.\nHow have you revisited the confinement in your own art?I created a few pieces related to the period of detention. There was SACRED, an installation consisting of six iron boxes with scale dioramas depicting my detention conditions. It showed in exact detail how I slept, walked, ate, was interrogated, washed and used the toilet. I also made The Divine Comedy, a heavy rock album that directly reflected this time.\nWith this play, your confinement became an artwork \u2013 how does that feel?When I heard of the play, I felt that it was created in the same spirit as my work at that time. I was trying to fight through all possible forms: artworks, online activities, interviews, happenings, photographs, videos. I would use whatever medium I could get. \n  What I have learned living in this kind of authoritarian society is that the struggle is often very difficult. Most of the time, your voice cannot be heard. There is no platform without censorship and tight police control. And even if you had a voice, very few people would be able to hear it. Those outside of China are too far away and nobody cares what they have to say. Those within China have the attention of a very small audience that shares the same feelings and can follow the argument. The arguments are not necessarily popular ones, either philosophically or aesthetically, and it takes some effort to follow along. \n  So when I heard at the time that a good theatre in London was putting on a play based on the book by Barnaby Martin, who is someone I knew to be very alert and attentive to my situation, I was encouraged and felt like it became a part of my activity.\nHow did the confinement change you?This was a very harsh experience and it\u2019s difficult to grasp it, or even deal with it. It\u2019s not a common experience so it\u2019s hard to share with another. There is no existing vocabulary to illustrate a condition that requires a special kind of reality. Once it comes to a point when the authority cannot rationally communicate or have a clear exchange of ideas or when they cannot allow the argument, then the only thing they can do is to make you feel that rationality, moral judgment and the law no longer work. They must prove to you that nothing works except power itself. And that power is identified with incomprehensible treatment, which can be ridiculous and surreal, but you must follow every step and detail to get through it.\nThe play\u2019s title includes the hashtag #aiww. How did social media change your life?It\u2019s an intelligent title. It\u2019s not social media that changed my entire life. My entire life is social media. Without social media, \u201cAi Weiwei\u201d simply does not exist. I live by social media. In a religious sense, it\u2019s not unlike the biblical reference to \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life\u201d.\nIn the play, the interrogators accuse you of being a fraud and a conman. Did this happen \u2013 and does it reflect any kind of internal criticism you may have about your art and the marketplace?It\u2019s quite strange. The interrogators never believed that what I did could be called art. They could not believe that something I took could be called art, or that something I dropped could be called art, or an action on the internet or pointing my middle finger toward a monument could be called art. They thought I was famous because I was paid by western anti-China forces. I do not blame them. I don\u2019t care whether my work is called art or not. I am an artist because I have no other job; it is not that I like the title very much. It is the only title where you don\u2019t have to do very much and no one will question it because people don\u2019t understand art anyway. I enjoy the liberty of being someone who is doing nothing practical. At the same time, in the west, including the art world, they think my work isn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d. I guess it is because I am not playing the game in the same way they are playing it, or my voice is different from their way of singing. This part I enjoy even more. If I have to call myself an artist, I would rather be different from the others.\nYour father was imprisoned \u2013 did you find strength through his experience during these 81 days?At the beginning of my detention, I was so proud of myself. I matched my father\u2019s experience from 80 years ago when he was imprisoned by the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) for political subversion. I was told my crime was subversion against the state. \n  Before I was detained, I was jealous of my father for having been imprisoned. Having grown up in this communist society, I was supposed to be a part of the second revolutionary generation. Having learned everything from Chairman Mao\u2019s education, there was no chance for me to be a criminal. That was true until I made arguments about the lawfulness of the existing party. I became the ultimate enemy of the established power, but still without a crime. They don\u2019t have to like me, but I did not think they would put me in jail. Once that was achieved, I kind of felt happy because it gave me an opportunity to argue my reasoning with them face to face.\nBefore the arrest, confrontations were never direct because they did not want to have any argument. First, they don\u2019t think you are entitled to an argument and, second, they are incapable of making an argument. I had tried to initiate the argument for years on the internet. It became my own game. No one was answering me and therefore the argument couldn\u2019t go further. I was fighting against an invisible enemy, which is everywhere but nowhere at the same time. So when it did happen, I thought it was wonderful. We are sitting face to face, two metres across, looking at each other. You ask a question and I answer. I felt some sense of power and usefulness in being confronted directly.\nWhat advice do you have for artists who are struggling financially and spiritually at this time of lockdown?Give up art. Do something which can bring home bread and soap. Rob a bank, but do not get caught.\nThere is a lengthy discussion in the play about how best to prepare Beijing noodles. What is your preferred method?You need to watch the noodles cook, not for too long or too short. It is really dependent on what kind of sauce you are cooking with. It can be very basic or have a variety of flavours. You could really write a long book about just this topic \u2026\n#aiww: The Arrest of Ai Weiwei by Howard Brenton will be streamed by the Guardian from 10am on 27 April until 10pm on 3 May.",

        "content": "Public meetings were banned in New South Wales during the last pandemic, but Australians adapted. And we will do so again\nAnzac Day 2020 will be a far cry from the Australian War Memorial\u2019s dawn service of recent years. While dignified and solemn, the dawn service has also been a spectacle. Sophisticated technology is used to project images from the memorial\u2019s photographic collection onto the building. From an hour before the service, members of the armed forces read from the diaries and letters of men and women who have served in war over more than a century.\nThe choreography of the whole event is unmistakable as national performance. Even the birdlife at the foot of Mount Ainslie seems to recognise it has a role to play with its singing and screeching and laughing \u2013 instantly recognisable as an Australian soundscape \u2013 alongside the speechmakers, catafalque party and bugling of the Last Post.\nThis year, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, it will be different. The dawn service will be held without members of the public, but will be televised on the ABC and streamed online. There will be no local marches.\nThe Returned and Services League (RSL) has encouraged people to film themselves reciting the ode in their homes and post it online. The RSL is partnering with News Corp in Light Up the Dawn, asking Australians to step into their driveways to observe a minute\u2019s silence, possibly carrying a candle or using mobile phones for illumination. They have even created a virtual candle you can download to your phone.\nWe can be sure the novelty of the 2020 Anzac Day commemoration will attract plenty of media attention. The Australian media have a ready-made, multipurpose rhetoric that is easily adapted to whatever novelty \u2013 minor or otherwise \u2013 each year\u2019s Anzac season brings with it. This year will be no exception.\nWe can expect to read and hear of Australians in these troubled times expressing mateship, of children in pyjamas and dressing gowns showing the young are connecting more and more with Anzac each year, that coronavirus has not dampened the Anzac spirit of the nation \u2013 and so on. We will learn of the doughty Australian suburbanites who weren\u2019t going to let a mere global pandemic get in the way of their appreciation of those who defend their freedoms. Our health workers will be seen as displaying the self-sacrifice and heroism of Anzac, born all those years ago on the shores of Gallipoli.\nAnzac 2020 will be less novel than it is presented. In the enforced private nature of Anzac commemoration in 2020, we are being returned to some of the earliest themes in Anzac commemoration.\nWhile the day has had its elements of public ritual since 1916, much early Anzac Day commemoration was private rather than public, sometimes conducted at the gravesides of Australian soldiers buried in cemeteries in Britain and Australia. Women were prominent in these efforts, honouring the memories of men they might or might not have known by placing flowers on their tombs.\nThere are other echoes of the past. Anzac Day in 1919 was also disrupted by a major crisis in public health. In New South Wales, where the rate of infection from Spanish influenza was high and the number of deaths \u2013 approaching 1,000 by Anzac Day \u2013 was alarming, the government had banned public meetings.\nThe government called off the march until May 22. When that happened, it was a fiasco. Rain prompted organisers to decide against marching all the way to Sydney\u2019s Domain, and soldiers and sailors who had come from Central Railway Station instead slipped straight into the service in the Town Hall. Unfortunately, no one remembered to tell the thousands of people lining the streets to watch.\nOn Anzac Day itself, there had still been activity \u2013 more than we\u2019ll see this year. The Centre for Soldiers\u2019 Wives and Mothers appealed to the parents of the city\u2019s children \u2013 home for their Easter break \u2013 to take their Shakespeare down from the shelf and read their children Henry V\u2019s speech to his troops before Agincourt.\nGallipoli might have made the nation, but Australians still looked for inspiration to a much longer British history stretching back through Mafeking, Rorke\u2019s Drift, Balaclava, Waterloo and Trafalgar \u2013 and even further to that \u201cband of brothers\u201d who made short work of the French on St Crispin\u2019s Day, 1415.\nThe Centre of Soldiers\u2019 Wives and Mothers held a service in the Domain. \u201cWomenfolk, many of them in mourning, preponderated\u201d, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, and most were wearing masks. The location of this service was pointed: it was at Woolloomooloo Bay, where so many soldiers had embarked for the war.\nOutside Sydney, there was also some disruption. \u201cThe Approach of Anzac Day this year was overlooked locally,\u201d explained a local newspaper at Dorrigo in northern New South Wales. \u201cOwing to the presence of the influenza epidemic, the thoughts of the people seem to have been turned away from other things.\u201d But there were Anzac Day activities; a surprising number, actually.\nAnzac Day was commemorated at Lismore, notwithstanding that the town had seen several serious cases of influenza and, in the week before Anzac Day, the deaths of two men. At Grafton, thousands enjoyed a soldiers\u2019 carnival. And in the other states, there were few signs of difficulty:\nAdelaide was gay with flags from end to end, and the trains and tramcars brought thousands of people into the central city to view the procession of soldiers.\nIn Brisbane, despite heavy rain, the route of a march of soldiers and returned men \u201cwas lined with thousands of people\u201d.\nA subdued Anzac Day in Perth was attributed not to the influenza but to the authorities\u2019 hope that the proclamation of peace in Europe would be timed so that the two \u201ccelebrations\u201d might merge.\nIn 1919, as soldiers returned to Australia on ships and often went into quarantine, the nature of Anzac Day commemoration remained fluid. It was still not a public holiday, and the Anzac Day march had not yet become an essential or permanent fixture of the city commemorations. Melbourne had no march on 25 April 1919, but then it didn\u2019t have a march on most other Anzac Days in these early years, either.\nSome will be disappointed there will be no marches and other public gatherings this year. But Anzac Day 2020 is less likely to be recalled as an absence than as yet another way in which Australians adapted their national life to the challenges of the greatest public health crisis for a century.\n This was originally published in the Conversation",

        "content": "Toxic fumes and repiratory disease among hazards facing people reliant on informal processing plants for work and fuel, study finds\nBlack pools, long trenches and charred earth have become common sights in the fields of north-west Syria, signs of an informal oil economy that has developed during the war.\nDespite damaging both the environment and health, up to 5,000 backyard oil refineries, crucial to the livelihoods of besieged Syrians, have cropped up in recent years, identified through satellite imagery in a report by open source investigators Bellingcat.\nIn and around the last remaining rebel-held areas, these refineries have provided fuel to a region where almost half the population has been displaced internally or from elsewhere in Syria. Yet they also bring a range of risks, according to the report\u2019s author Wim Zwijnenburg, a researcher with Dutch peace advocacy group Pax.\n\u201cThere was a need for oil and you could see on satellite imagery that artisanal refinery was growing but there are also concerns about health because of the dangerous working conditions like barrels that could explode,\u201d said Zwijnenburg. \u201cPeople were exposed to toxic fumes from burning that\u2019s going on, and also a lot of children were involved.\u201d\nThe clusters of refineries around the region receive oil transported from fields in eastern Syria and process it into fuel used for cooking, heating and transport by using rudimentary set-ups to burn it.\nThe open source material and satellite imagery used by Zwijnenburg shows that many refineries have emerged in fields that were still green until 2016.\nThere had previously been tens of thousands of refineries operating in north-east Syria, closer to the oil fields, before territory was seized from Isis and formal production returned.\nLocals say the toxic smoke produced by the refineries has caused air pollution, contaminated water supplies and caused explosions that have forced a response from the White Helmets, the rescue group that runs operations in anti-government areas.\n\u201cSome of these locations are operational for a year, so you see issues around respiratory problems, skin diseases and you see long-term concerns about cancer. Burning this fuel day in, day out raises a lot of concerns among locals,\u201d said Zwijnenburg.\nHe said oil waste produced by these operations was increasingly turned into cooking coals, which heightens health risks because it involves scraping the waste from barrels used in the burning process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very dirty job,\u201d said Syrian activist Wissam Zarqa. \u201c[A worker\u2019s] skin would become darkened all the time, not from lack of cleanness. However he tries to clean himself, it would not work.\u201d\nA displaced former resident from the Aleppo countryside, who did not want to be named, said the refineries have increased the suffering of Syrians but also been necessary, especially in areas resisting the return of government control.\n\u201cIt is a problem, especially for the children. Personally I had problems sometimes because my village is small and some of the villagers were burning oil very close to the homes, only 150 metres away.\n\u201cIn the area of the burners there is a lot of pollution because of the smell from the smoke, which reached into my house. My son was very small and he developed breathing problems.\u201d\nThe resident said, however, that the refineries had also become important for Syrians living in rebel-held areas. This was partly because oil, which costs more than $100 (\u00a381) a barrel, has become so expensive, and partly down to refineries becoming a major source of work, both within processing plants and for those who transport oil from the oil fields.\nMuch of the oil is transported by tanker through Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria, activity that has been captured on satellite imagery included in the Bellingcat report.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has claimed that much of the oil is pumped from fields in Kurdish-held areas and owned by politicians with links to President Bashar al-Assad.\nA bombing campaign by Assad\u2019s forces and Russia displaced hundreds of thousands in Idlib and intensified food and fuel shortages through the winter, especially as many of the refineries were targeted.\n\u201cThis is a fundamental problem for the residents here, fuel is needed for cars and to fuel the ovens we need to bake bread,\u201d the former resident said.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have a choice, they are forced by this matter,\u201d he added, suggesting that the refineries would not be needed if fuel were provided to them or prices were cheaper.\n\u201cIf only there was some help to providing an alternative, people would take another route.\u201d\n This article was amended on 25 April 2020 to correct the main picture caption, which described the oil refinery at al-Qahtaniyah as being in the north-west of Syria when it is in the north-east.",

        "content": "Club\u2019s compassionate approach recognises that lockdown life \u2018leaves a big hole\u2019 for children ripped from their usual routines\nLast Friday I had a good old-fashioned nosy at Ryan Giggs\u2019s kitchen, close enough to check out his fancy light fittings \u2013 if only virtually. Like much of the past month, it was a surreal experience, this one conjured up by the youth development team at Manchester United.\nWhen, one Saturday morning in 2014, a man in a padded jacket slid along the touchline to hand me his number on a scrap of paper, I looked at him blankly. He said he was a scout for United and would like to get my son down to the development centre to take a closer look. I was pretty dubious \u2013 our little boy was only five.\nFive and a half years later he\u2019s still pulling on the red kit once a week, effervescent with excitement on the drive to Carrington, hidden away among the flat fields and winding lanes just off the M60. In a perverse way, from a parental point of view, we\u2019ve been lucky; he\u2019s had all the thrills but not reached the heady heights of the academy, where a much more intense level of commitment and sacrifice is required from all members of the family.\nIt has been a fascinating experience by proxy, watching a diverse selection of boys come and go, some fleetingly, others fast-tracked, and trying to work out why each one is special. What unites them is a complete devotion to the game and their football education. There must have been incidents with discipline but I\u2019ve never seen one, and the silence as they train never stops being a surprise. In a way unusual for groups of young boys, there is a real seriousness about their purpose. They are told that they are here for a reason, show it.\nUnited don\u2019t over-promise. There seems to be no desire to make the kids too professional, too soon \u2013 they just let them play. They try to do cultural things, educate; recently the under-12s curated an exhibition at Carrington on Walter Tull, one of the first black footballers and the first black British officer to lead white troops \u2013 and United\u2019s senior squad came across from their building to be shown around by the younger boys.\nA few days into the lockdown, an email arrived from the academy. It was thoughtful, kind. It reminded us that parents are the biggest influence on a child and encouraged reading and a regular bedtime. It went on: \u201cDuring the coming weeks we still want the boys to enjoy their childhood, explore learning for themselves, use their imagination and be creative. Some of the best learning to take place during this prolonged period of time at home will be created by the boys themselves.\u201d It advised parents \u201cnot to force your boys to practise. Let them practise because they are in love with football\u201d.\nThere has been regular contact since. They\u2019ve sent worksheets, encouraged the boys to look after their wellbeing and made a short film of all the fitness sessions that the boys designed and sent in via WhatsApp. And then there are those hour-long Friday morning Q&A sessions, each watched by nearly 200 children. The first week they were able to question Michael Carrick; the second, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, whose Scando-Manc commitment to the academy sing-songed through each answer; then Giggs; and, on Friday, comes Marcus Rashford, a local boy who grew up on free school meals, and who in the past few weeks has helped to raise \u00a320m for FareShare, a charity aimed at relieving food poverty.\nThe programme was drawn together from scratch in a few days by the academy head, Nick Cox, and his team. \u201cThe consensus was that we had to do something,\u201d says Cox. \u201cFootball brings together people from all walks of life. Some boys will be enjoying time with their families, for other boys it will be very difficult; some will be struggling financially or health-wise, living in cramped conditions at the top of a block of flats. Some of these kids will normally be with us four or five times a week \u2013 it leaves a big hole in their lives.\u201d\nBefore arriving at Old Trafford four years ago, Cox was at Watford and Sheffield United. Both have great youth setups but United is different. It is just so huge and has, in Cox\u2019s words, \u201can absolute commitment to youth which surpasses all others\u201d. Last December the club celebrated their 4,000th consecutive game with an academy player in their match-day squad, a sequence going back 82 years. Cox has had no problem persuading big names to help him with his Friday interviews: \u201cIt is what Manchester United is about \u2013 they all understand the value of the academy.\u201d\nThis is just one small story about a huge club. It has nothing to do with the vats of cash swilling around at the top \u2013 though huge sums are ploughed into the academy \u2013 and everything to do with human relationships at ground level, supporting the boys and girls who are never happier than with a ball flicking, flicking, at their toes. Alongside United continuing to pay casual staff despite there being no games for them to steward, and City and United giving a joint donation to Greater Manchester food banks, it illustrates that nothing is simple; that Premier League football may be greedy and selfish, but it can also be life-enhancing and compassionate.\nIt is quite possible, of course, that none of those boys hanging on to Giggs\u2019s every word as he advised young wingers, and admitted that Sir Alex Ferguson could be \u201ca scary man\u201d, will make it as a professional footballer. But they might remember that during a very confusing time in their lives, when their freedoms disappeared and the thing they loved best was taken away, their club didn\u2019t forget them.",

        "content": "Some of you have been brave enough to pick up your scissors and clippers in lockdown. The results look great \u2026 from the front, anyway\nSince I was already growing my beard and hair during lockdown, I decided to do something fun with it while raising money for a great cause. This led me to create the #hairforhospitality challenge, which has raised about \u00a31,200 thus far for Hospitality Action\u2019s emergency relief fund by letting donors decide on how my look will change for the remainder of lockdown. The official reveal was Friday, and the new look speaks for itself. Matthew Holy\nMy wife decided to give me a mohawk as I have no jobs for the foreseeable future. It looks a lot better than the 70s porn star hair that was starting to show. Gordie Cavill\nMy partner and I have shaved our heads and committed to donating \u20ac8 per centimetre our hair grows to supporting the homeless. Let\u2019s turn this bald gesture into a bold one! Lesley Horn\nI fleetingly suggested to a housemate that we all peroxide our hair and, unfortunately for me, my housemate mobilised to make this bold suggestion a reality. Five hours later, the vision was realised. Unlike most groups of five adults in the park, we can take our daily exercise together. We found out the easy way; police don\u2019t question the living arrangement of a motley group with identical, striking, blonde hair. We are now more of a family than we\u2019d ever had imagined. Fi Wilson\nAfter growing steadily more uncomfortable with the length of my regularly barbered hair, I decided to go for it and cut the mop. What could go wrong? The first few strokes of the shaver revealed a natural talent for self-barbering. It even looked quite cool. The next step was to tackle the thickest part of the mop, at the top. A shave here, a snip there and it would be complete. Unfortunately, as I was feeling rather pleased with my newfound abilities, I lost focus for a millisecond. And in this moment I left what can only be described as a crater in the top of my head. I could have been a 12th century Cistercian monk. What does one do with such a disaster and no hairdressers open? Julian Chackathayil\nAfter a fair bit of arm-twisting and my reassuring him that it would be a doddle, my husband agreed to cut my hair. He did the back and I sorted the front and sides. I was stoked at the result. Judy Nieuwendijk\nOn a scorching Saturday afternoon, my older sister reluctantly agreed to cut my hair. Our mother\u2019s funeral was on the following Friday and my hair was out of control. I sat in the garden for hours in the hot sun as my sister slowly but surely cut my hair, at first with the clippers and then on to scissors. She did a fantastic job. She has absolutely no hairdressing experience! Lee Nottle\nI wanted to do something to raise some funds for NHS Charities Together during the crisis to show my appreciation for everything they are doing to protect us during this scary time. So I decided I would shave my head. My original target was \u00a3500 and I gave myself two weeks to reach the target, hoping to get there eventually. A lot of amazing people donated. I\u2019ve made more than \u00a31,300 \u2013 and I\u2019ve shaved my head! Lucy Swift\nI hadn\u2019t had a haircut since last December when the lockdown went live in Qu\u00e9bec. After a couple of weeks stuck inside, I was faced with an unruly messed-up forest on top, a mean beard growing down, and some seriously mounting self-esteem issues. Am I a man? A beast? A man-beast? Will I ever see my face again? I asked my girlfriend to kindly try her best. She was initially way too shy with the scissors, so I handed over my clippers, despite not having shaved my hair in 20 years! She went to town and I haven\u2019t felt this good-looking in months. I\u2019ll definitely do it again! Alexis de Becque\nI wanted to go for something nostalgic, so chose a bowl cut. Are we ever going to get away with these hairstyles again? I knew it would generate a bit of a giggle. I own three bars in Edinburgh and wanted the staff to have a laugh, to cheer them up a bit. Iain McPherson\nIt is a little-known fact that Antoni Gaud\u00ed designed his staggeringly beautiful Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona by hanging thousands of tiny sacks of sand on strings, then attaching them together so that gravity forced the strings into the forms he wished. He then took a photo of the structure, turned the photo upside down and built the cathedral based on the upside-down photo. Likewise, the trick to cutting one\u2019s own hair is to stand in front of a mirror with your head upside down, let gravity splay out your hair, and then trim it like a bush so that it falls more evenly. I have been doing this for years and, though I have no hairdressing experience, people keep telling me my hair looks nice. Gracias, Antoni. Angus Sinclair\nMy husband asked me to use his clippers to cut his hair. I said yes, if he would do my long hair too. He started by taking the clippers and cutting off two pigtails. Then he gave me a number five. It was the most hilarious experience, although nerve-racking for him. I think he was worried about how I would react. I\u2019ve never had so many compliments before. Short, buzz-cut hair is so freeing. I really recommend it. I\u2019m sure I was born with more hair than I have now. I was so moved by the compliments I got on it, I decided to set up a fundraiser for Shelter UK. I will dye my hair blue when I reach my fundraising goal \u2013 blue to show my support for the NHS. Trupti\nI cut my husband Chris\u2019s hair using thinning scissors, sewing scissors and clippers. The brief was to reduce the bulk at the sides and neaten the perimeter. I took a bit too much off around one ear, so there is a slight \u201chole\u201d there if you look closely. He was not happy about that, but otherwise it was a professional-looking result. I was even praised on our shared chat groups. The neat \u201cedging\u201d around the back was a lot easier to achieve than expected! Angela Parikh\nMy self-cut was more or less a success. I looked up a WikiHow article and, after a brief scan, decided that was all the encouragement I needed. However, I did limit myself to trimming back and sides with my beard clippers. One small problem was that the numbers on its scale do not correspond to those on a pro clipper. So the number four setting gave me a number two haircut. Another problem is that the top of the back is not well blended and looks pretty stark and rough. My wife says it\u2019s not too bad though. Aaron Kennedy\nI love my lockdown haircuts. I started hacking at my hair some time ago and now it\u2019s become an obsession. My mum wanted me to be a hairdresser \u2013 she was right. The secret to my cut is to mostly keep it one length, just a bit shorter at the front, and just trim. Only take off a quarter of an inch at a time \u2013 that way you will not mess up too much. I trim mine almost every week now! What else is a girl to do during lockdown? Today it had to look perfect, as it was my birthday. Anna Caliendo\nHairdressing salons in Denmark are reopening this week, but nobody knew that a week ago when I asked my wife to cut my hair. The result won\u2019t win any beauty contests, but it was easy, practical, and done in less than 10 minutes. My regular hairdresser can undo the damage in a couple of weeks. Jesper Sommer\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while, and watching videos on YouTube recommendations. One early morning I decided that was it: I washed my hair, took the pair of scissors, and got to it. My youngest girl said she was afraid of the scissors and ran away. It was a huge success! Now, I\u2019m trying to find the moment to go on both my daughters! Miranda Cassino, Argentina\nIt\u2019s very much a video-conference-ready haircut. The back holds up less well under scrutiny, but I\u2019ve definitely paid for worse cuts, so a success overall. Surprisingly, I found it a therapeutic process. Coping with lockdown is about focusing on the things you can control rather than worrying what the whole world is up to; cutting your hair just brings one more little thing under your control. Chris Cummings\nThe sad fact is that my wife, Marion, has been cutting my hair at home for several years now, the little that I have left requiring no more than a quick going-over with the clippers. The dog (Rio, a grumpy Lhasa Apso) was more of a challenge. He had been booked in for the groomers the morning after the lockdown was announced. Desperate times. He was less than happy halfway through, but the end result was great. Scott Blair",

        "content": "Behavioural science is being used to tackle some of Brazil\u2019s biggest challenges, from the pandemic to extreme weather\nBrazil has been the Latin American country hardest-hit so far by the coronavirus pandemic, with many fearing that deaths from Covid-19 are rocketing well beyond the 2,588 officially recorded so far.\nThe situation is particularly dire for the millions of Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where physical distancing is almost impossible. But Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro doesn\u2019t seem to be taking concerns over the virus seriously, accusing the media of \u201chysteria\u201d. And he has clashed with Rio de Janeiro\u2019s governor, Wilson Witzel, who has ordered the state\u2019s 17 million citizens to stay at home \u2013 and off the city\u2019s beaches.\nHelping in the effort to keep people safe and away from public areas is NudgeRio, a department in Rio\u2019s city hall that uses behavioural science to influence people\u2019s decisions. The team has helped produce messages to encourage people to stay at home, including a photograph of Sugar Loaf mountain with accompanying text that reads: \u201cRio\u2019s landscape gives the hint. Let\u2019s flatten the curve.\u201d\nFor the past week, city hall has been sending drones around the city with audio messages, created by NudgeRio, to remind people to avoid crowded areas and to wash their hands. \u201cWe have produced three messages so far, but will be doing more,\u201d says Jose Moulin Netto, who set up NudgeRio in 2018.\nThe team is also involved in a project to combat growing domestic violence, a global problem exacerbated by lockdown situations. Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence.\nThe nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler\u2019s insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for individuals and society.\nFormer UK prime minister David Cameron was a fan and in 2010 set up the first nudge unit, the Cabinet Office behavioural insights team. Its successes include sending letters to British GPs who were prescribing more than their peers, cutting unnecessary prescriptions by 3.3%.\nThe UK government\u2019s early response to the pandemic was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team. But this was subsequently changed and, as Tony Yates, a former professor of economics at Birmingham University, pointed out in early March, the UK strategy was an outlier: \u201cIf the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the \u2018science\u2019?\u201d\nBefore coronavirus took hold, the four permanent members of the Rio team were working onchanging messaging to tackle flooding. In April 2019, Rio de Janeiro recorded its worst level of rainfall in 22 years, with storms that left 10 people dead. \n  Monsoon rains impact poorer communities worst, especially those in favelas on steep hillsides. This year alone, about 150 Brazilians have been killed or are missing following heavy rains, landslides and flooding.\nSummer in the city is always \u201cproblematic\u201d, according to Thais Miguelino, a spokeswoman for the Rio operations centre that monitors traffic, accidents and weather and manages crisis situations, including the pandemic. \u201cWe need to know how to communicate with people so they know what they need to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea is to change people\u2019s thinking so we can save lives.\u201d\nThe centre wants to work out how best to use its social media channels to communicate messages that will encourage people to stay put and avoid travel during a storm, or advise them how to get to a place of safety. To do this, NudgeRio has created different personas, including a mother with a baby and an older person, and seen how they might react to events such as flooding or a landslide.\n\u201cThe rain in Rio is unpredictable and varies according to which region of the city you\u2019re in,\u201d explains Rafaela Bastos, a member of the NudgeRio team. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the population knows how to take decisions in certain situations, to be prepared and reflect on what to do with the information available.\u201d\nOther NudgeRio projects relate to tax collection, school registration and reducing jaywalking and have led to savings. But the team faces challenges getting people to take nudge seriously and proving the impact of projects. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince people and to get employees involved,\u201d admits Moulin.\nInnovation in the public sector is always a challenge, he adds: \u201cThe public sector has to abide by certain rules. There are very specific definitions of what you can do. It\u2019s so much harder.\u201d\nThere has also been criticism of the nudge approach. Sometimes it\u2019s seen as a sticking plaster for gaping holes in public services that need more investment. Rio\u2019s summer weather, for instance, has always been unpredictable, yet the same problems keep reappearing, suggesting a more structural approach is required.\nMoulin and the NudgeRio team acknowledge the pitfalls but remain excited by the potential impact. They cite a project with the city\u2019s education department as an example.\nEvery two years, the Brazilian government holds a national exam to measure the academic performance of public school students aged 10-11 and 14-15, with a mock test a month beforehand. Last year NudgeRio was asked to try to increase participation and students\u2019 grades.\nOn the eve of the mock exam, the department of education sent an inspirational message from the education secretary, for parents to pass on to their children the following morning. The result? On average, grades rose by 4.1%.\n\u201cI can\u2019t emphasise it enough,\u201d says Moulin. \u201cThis message was sent at 7.30pm in the evening on the day before the exam and yet there was a significant increase in grades. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.\u201d\n This article was amended on 28 April 2020.

A total of NZ$17m had been paid back to the government, and of more than 2,400 audits undertaken, just 183 cases required further investigation.\n\u201cWe owe it to those workers and employers to make sure their good work isn\u2019t undermined by anyone abusing the scheme,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe also have a duty to all New Zealanders to ensure taxpayer money is going where it is intended to support the economy.\u201d\nSince 20 March 30,000 people had also applied for the jobseeker benefit, Robertson said, and food banks around the country were experiencing growth in demand of up to 600%.\n\u201cThis has been a true New Zealand effort in fighting a once-in-a-century social and economic crisis \u2026 we will continue to draw ideas from people from all walks of life,\u201d Robertson said, saying the May budget would be focused on rebuilding the economy, which is expected to contract by more than 7% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nThere are three more days until New Zealand\u2019s strict lockdown ends and the country moves from level four to level three, meaning 400,000 people can go back to work, and food and online deliveries will be permitted, as will swimming, surfing, fishing and hunting.\nMore than 1,400 New Zealanders have been infected with Covid-19 and 17 have died, all with pre-existing health conditions.

        "content": "Continuing our series of writers recommending underseen films available to stream, a recommendation for a sly screwball comedy from 1936\nSometimes escapist films only need to take the audience a few steps, or city blocks, from reality. Gregory La Cava\u2019s My Man Godfrey, a peerless comedy from Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, is a screwball with a social conscience. This 1936 classic is a glamorous 90 minutes of frivolity that doesn\u2019t so much explore the divided society of the Great Depression, as take the imbalance between the haves and have-nots as the launchpad for a series of grimly bitter jokes. With slammers of punchlines.\nIn the movie\u2019s audacious opening scene, we meet William Powell as Godfrey, \u201cDuke\u201d to his down-at-heel pals. He\u2019s a tramp, apparently, living on a New York City dump under the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. Two cars pull up next to the ash piles, disgorging Cornelia and Irene Bullock, \u201cPark Avenue brats\u201d in evening wear. They\u2019ve come to find a \u201cForgotten Man\u201d, a victim of the Depression, as part of a grotesque scavenger hunt game being played by the wealthy patrons of the glittering (fictional) Waldorf Ritz Hotel. Offered five dollars to be dragged into the foyer as a prize, Godfrey quite understandably pushes the haughty Cornelia into a heap of muck. But his relationship with Irene (Carole Lombard) takes a more interesting turn. Irene wins the scavenger hunt by bringing Godfrey to the hotel, but also gives him a job as the family butler. This being a comedy, romance will ensue. But as it\u2019s a screwball, something nastier will follow.\nThe humour in My Man Godfrey is madcap, but in the best way, and the main source of comedy is the vulgar behaviour of the spoiled, witless Bullock family. Their zigzagging conversations are filled with entertaining gibberish about proteges and pets, until their disregard for the wellbeing of those who work for them becomes as ridiculous as it is mean. Alice Brady is particularly unhinged as the alcohol-addled mother, who sees pixies but not the plain truth. Eugene Pallette has a more flattering role as the exasperated patriarch. While the Bullocks have the most sparkling dialogue, the lower-class characters have the best lines. Told that \u201cprosperity is just around the corner\u201d, one tramp mutters, \u201cI wish I knew which corner\u201d, while Godfrey\u2019s exchanges with the Bullocks\u2019 maid (\u201cMay I be frank\u201d \u2013 \u201cIs that your name?\u201d) are far more to the point that the family\u2019s meaningless noise. The dialogue is mostly the work of director La Cava, who co-wrote the script with Morrie Ryskind from Eric Hatch\u2019s novel 1101 Fifth Avenue, but also liked to improvise on the shoot. Lombard said that anyone who enjoyed the film should \u201ccredit 75% of it to Gregory La Cava, who directed it, wrote all the dialogue, and literally gave birth to it\u201d. Her own on-set ad libs were mostly too blue to make the final cut.\nIt\u2019s a sly film too, that satirises and glamorises in the same breath, where a hotel foyer full of high-society types is compared to a lunatic asylum. It\u2019s likely Lombard never wore a more beautiful gown than the shimmering silver number, complete with cape, that Travis Banton designed for her to wear in this film. That her character wears it to a trash-heap, in search of a human prize \u201cthat nobody wants\u201d, is the essence of the film\u2019s satire. And yet poor Irene is one of the best of a bad bunch: sincere if stupid, kind-hearted if misguided.\nLombard remains the queen of the screwball subgenre, and her Irene, who talks, and acts, in an outlandish stream of consciousness, is one of her finest creations. \u201cNutty, slaphappy, goofy\u201d was how her friend Mitchell Leisen summed up Irene, recalling how Lombard strove to make sense of a woman whose words \u201clacked continuity, were unrelated and without thought\u201d.\nDespite the diverting babble and dramatic poses, her character has a clear path. From the moment she meets Godfrey in the dump, her life of luxury begins to tarnish. As she explains the rules of the scavenger hunt, she seems astonished by the absurd cruelty of the project \u2013 a prank she once took for granted that now seems as strange as wearing a silver evening gown to a Hooverville shanty town. It\u2019s the start of something. Irene and Godfrey have a few layers of pretence to shed before they can be united \u2013 his pretensions are just as calculated as her artful tantrums, although he has nobler intentions.\nThere\u2019s joy to be found in the romance between Godfrey and Irene, though in this comedy of misunderstanding, their affair runs along parallel tracks, seemingly destined never to meet. Powell and Lombard spark beautifully with each other. Well they might: they had previously been married for two years, and remained pals in the three years since their divorce. In fact Powell nominated Lombard for the role \u2013 he knew she was the best fit for the film \u2013 and their divorce had been as amicable as their marriage, which was undone by the 16-year age difference, and then Lombard\u2019s introduction to Clark Gable, who would become the great love of her short life.\nHollywood escapism is rarely as simple as it promises to be, and the best Golden Age treasures have more to offer than silk gowns and sharp dialogue. As films tend to, My Man Godfrey offers a neat, gentrified solution to many of America\u2019s prevailing ills, one that may seem increasingly unconvincing as the decades turn by. Films may not be the place to make social policy, but the best of them can make us look at the world in new way, just as Irene does.\nMy Man Godfrey is available on Amazon Prime in the UK and US",

        "content": "30 British attendees at Panama event criticise embassy and say they fear being stuck for months\nIt must have seemed like a dream adventure: a two-week festival on a beach in Central America, camping out under the stars at night in what organisers called \u201cparadise on Earth\u201d.\nBut because of the coronavirus outbreak, a group of 30 British workers and volunteers at the festival are stranded in a makeshift camp facing nonstop rain, a difficult relationship with the British embassy, and a sewage problem.\nThe group were taking part in Tribal Gathering, a festival in Panama billed as \u201can amazing indigenous musical journey through time and space\u201d.\nThe festival was put in lockdown in mid-March after Panama declared a national emergency following its first coronavirus case. That meant many attendees missed their flights home. Some managed to leave the site and catch later flights, but others are still there.\nPeter Grant, from Somerset, who volunteered in the kitchens at the festival, praised the organisers\u2019 work to take care of them but said the Britons had received insufficient support from the British embassy and feared they could be stuck for months.\n\u201cWe were in limbo for about a week,\u201d Grant said. \u201cInitially the embassy offered buses to Panama City but we only had 12 hours to decide. We also had no guarantee of being able to get a flight. In the end some of those people got their flights cancelled while they were in the airport queue.\u201d\nHe said people were not keen to leave the site without knowing what would happen to them next. \u201cAt the time the beach was the safer option for us, and we were never offered those buses again.\u201d\nAt first, he said, the beach wasn\u2019t too bad. \u201cThe festival organisers were great. They were delivering food and provided us with big tents to shelter in. There was also running water.\u201d\nThen the weather changed. \u201cIt rained nonstop for a few days. There was no sewage system and disgusting water was pouring everywhere. Not only that, a few people have mental health issues and they started really struggling.\u201d\nHe said the group made repeated attempts to speak to the embassy. \u201cThey just kept giving us the same options every time, saying \u2018hold tight\u2019 or giving us expensive hotel options in Panama City with no means of getting there. And there were no options for flights home.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve faced bureaucracy from Panamanian officials, too. You need permits to move around and they don\u2019t really want Europeans going into the city.\u201d\nHannah Bates, from Brighton, who was part of the production crew for the festival, was one of those who got on the buses sent by the embassy on 20 March. She is now staying in an Airbnb in Panama City and is quickly running out of money.\n\u201cThe embassy had written to the production manager saying they\u2019d send buses to collect British nationals to go to Panama City, and that this would be their last chance to get out of Panama,\u201d she said.\nIn a video seen by the Guardian, a British embassy worker tells her and others on the bus: \u201cYou should be aware flights will be suspended internationally from Sunday [23 March]. If you don\u2019t get a flight by Sunday, you won\u2019t be going anywhere for at least 30 days.\u201d\nBates booked an overnight hotel and went to the airport the next day to catch her flight. \u201cAt the desk they confirmed that I could get to New York for my layover, but that all flights out of New York were cancelled. I didn\u2019t feel safe leaving to stay in New York as I couldn\u2019t get back to the UK from there.\u201d\nShe then tried to get a flight via any route back to the UK but was told that the airport would be closed the next day. \u201cI sat on the ground and broke down. I felt alone and scared in the airport.\u201d\nIn a now-deleted post on Facebook on 28 March, the embassy said there was limited availability for Brits on flights going back to mainland Europe, but \u201cnone of these flights is destined for the UK and onward connection will be the responsibility of anyone seeking to go home\u201d. Travellers would have to report to the airport at \u201cvery short notice\u201d for these flights, which for those stuck at the beach was not possible.\nTwo days later the government announced a \u00a375m scheme to help repatriate Britons stranded abroad, and suggested citizens should get on any available commercial flights \u201cwithout delay\u201d. For those left in Panama, flights out quickly became fully booked, were cancelled or were too expensive.\nThis week Panamanian authorities announced a 30-day extension to its ban on international travel into and out of the country.\n\u201cThe embassy is a joke,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThere was a glorified lift-off site and that was it. There\u2019s been no help with food, accommodation, nothing. We\u2019re told there are no further plans of future flights for Britons leaving Panama, and now we were being offered lifts back home on flights put on by other European countries. Then how do I get home from there? I\u2019ve lost three flights already; I\u2019m not in a financial position to keep booking them. We\u2019re facing months here.\u201d\nThe Foreign Office said it had helped 85 people return to the UK. \u201cWe are in regular contact with members of the group remaining at Tribal Gathering,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have provided details of available accommodation and have offered safe passage letters to assist in moving there.\u201d",

In September the Taiwan affairs office of China\u2019s state council said he was being investigated for \u201cengaging in criminal acts that endanger state security\u201d, and in late November Chinese media revealed he had been arrested in Guangzhou.\nAt least three other Taiwan residents were arrested around the same time, for charges relating to assisting foreign forces in relation to Hong Kong or endangering national security.\nSince the protests began last summer the Chinese government and state media has repeatedly blamed \u201cforeign forces\u201d, in particular the UK and US, for creating chaos in Hong Kong and supporting the protests.\n\u201cSome foreign forces are seizing the opportunity to advance their own strategy to hurt China by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong,\u201d said a China Daily editorial in June.\n\u201cThe US should know one thing, that Hong Kong is China\u2019s Hong Kong and we do not allow any foreign interference,\u201d said the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, about the unrest in July.\nIn November the vice-foreign minister told the US to \u201cstop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China\u2019s internal matters\u201d.\nLee\u2019s case is the first prosecution of a foreigner in relation to the protests, but more than 7,000 citizens, mostly young Hong Kongers, have been charged or prosecuted.\nOn Friday the pro-democracy former legislator Au Nok-hin was sentenced to 140 hours of community service after being convicted of assault by yelling through a loudspeaker and damaging the hearing of a police officer.\nDespite consistent accusations of brutality against demonstrators, no police officers have faced charges.\nCrackdowns on those leading and participating in the pro-democracy protests reached a crescendo last week, with the arrest of 15 senior figures including the 81-year-old barrister and founder of the Democratic party, Martin Lee.\nInterventions by Beijing\u2019s top bodies in Hong Kong have also deepened the city\u2019s political crisis, ahead of legislative council elections in September. Last year Hong Kongers voted overwhelmingly in favour of pro-democracy candidates in the district council elections, despite the damage done by the protests to the city\u2019s social and economic life.\nIt is widely anticipated that once coronavirus physical distancing measures are lifted the protests will return, and that they will have been spurred on by recent events.\nBefore he was arrested, Martin Lee told the Guardian he believed Beijing and its supporters were \u201cresorting to all kinds of tricks\u201d to ensure pro-democracy candidates could not run in September.\n\u201cThey are now trying to do everything to help pro-Beijing candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even some pro-Beijing legislators said that it could be counter-productive.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Pei Lin Wu",

        "content": "Doctors warn US president\u2019s musings on disinfectant as a cure for coronavirus could lead to death\nDonald Trump has stunned viewers by suggesting people could receive injections of disinfectant to cure the coronavirus, a notion one medical expert described as \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d.\nAt Thursday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, the US president mused on new government research into how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces.\nTrump said: \u201cAnd then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute! And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds interesting to me.\u201d\nDr Deborah Birx, the taskforce response coordinator, remained silent. But social media erupted in outrage at the president, who has a record of defying science and also floated the idea of treating patients\u2019 bodies with ultraviolet (UV) light.\nSeveral doctors warned the public against injecting disinfectant or using UV light and a leading household cleaner manufacturer urged users not to inject it into their bodies.\nReckitt Benckiser, the British-based maker of Dettol and Lysol, said in a statement: \u201cWe must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\u201d\nPolitical commentators joined the condemnation. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and a former labor secretary, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s briefings are actively endangering the public\u2019s health. Boycott the propaganda. Listen to the experts. And please don\u2019t drink disinfectant.\u201d\nWalter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, added: \u201cIt is incomprehensible to me that a moron like this holds the highest office in the land and that there exist people stupid enough to think this is OK. I can\u2019t believe that in 2020 I have to caution anyone listening to the president that injecting disinfectant could kill you.\u201d\nTrump was already facing a backlash over his championing of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, as a therapy for the coronavirus, a quixotic effort amplified by the conservative network Fox News. Research has found no evidence that it is beneficial and a government vaccine expert has claimed he was fired for limiting its use.\nUndeterred, on Thursday Trump showcased an \u201cemerging result\u201d from Department of Homeland Security research that indicates coronavirus appears to weaken more quickly when exposed to sunlight, heat and humidity, raising hopes that it could become less contagious in summer months.\nBill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, said at the briefing: \u201cOur most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus \u2013 both surfaces and in the air. We\u2019ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well, where increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favourable to the virus.\u201d\nResearchers found that the virus survives best indoors and in dry conditions, and loses potency when temperatures and humidity rise. Bryan said: \u201cThe virus dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight under these conditions.\u201d\nHe showed a slide summarising the results of the experiment that were carried out at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center. He also said tests had been carried out with disinfectants and isopropyl alcohol, specifically in saliva or in respiratory fluids.\n\u201cAnd I can tell you that bleach will kill the virus in five minutes; isopropyl alcohol will kill the virus in 30 seconds, and that\u2019s with no manipulation, no rubbing \u2013 just spraying it on and letting it go. You rub it and it goes away even faster. We\u2019re also looking at other disinfectants, specifically looking at the Covid-19 virus in saliva.\u201d\nTrump seized on the findings to refer back to a claim he made on 14 February that warm weather might kill the virus, like common flu, noting that he had been criticised by the media. \u201cI think a lot of people are going to go outside, all of a sudden, people that didn\u2019t want to go outside,\u201d he said.\nAnd he asked Bryan an extraordinary question: \u201cSo I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you\u2019re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous \u2013 whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2013 and I think you said that that hasn\u2019t been checked, but you\u2019re going to test it.\n\u201cAnd then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you\u2019re going to test that too. It sounds interesting.\u201d\nBryan responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the right folks who could.\u201d\nUV rays are an invisible type of radiation that can penetrate and damage skin cells, and overexposure can cause skin cancer. How much sunlight would be needed to have an effect on the coronavirus is unknown. The virus has caused heavy death tolls in warm-weather areas such as Louisiana and Florida, and Singapore has seen a recent surge in cases.\nA Washington Post reporter asked if it was dangerous for Trump to make people think they would be safe by going outside in summer heat. The president turned to Bryan and said: \u201cI would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there\u2019s any way that you can apply light and heat to cure.\n\u201cMaybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d\nIn a cringeworthy moment, he asked Birx if she had ever heard of heat and light in relation to the coronavirus. \u201cNot as a treatment,\u201d she said, explaining that the body responds to the virus with a fever.\nWhen the Post reporter pressed further, Trump retorted: \u201cI\u2019m the president and you\u2019re fake news \u2026 I\u2019m just here to present talent, I\u2019m here to present ideas.\u201d\nExperts questioned why the homeland security report had been promoted at the briefing. Dr Irwin Redlener, the director of the Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told MSNBC: \u201cEverything that this scientist talked about from homeland security was basically incoherent, nonsensical, not really supported by evidence and really quite contrary to a lot of things that we do know about some of the things he was saying.\n\u201cFirst of all, people do get Covid, have been getting Covid in warm climates. Second of all, this issue with UV light is hypothetical, but also UV light can be very harmful and we did not hear anything resembling a balanced discussion of what the evidence is for and against UV light, but it\u2019s certainly not ready for prime time.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe very fact that the president actually asked somebody about what sounded like injecting disinfectants or isopropyl alcohol into the human body was kind of jaw-dropping.\u201d",

        "content": "PM also rejects teachers\u2019 union calls for physical distancing in classrooms saying it is \u2018not a credible requirement\u2019\nScott Morrison has laid down the gauntlet to aged care providers over what he sees as excessive restrictions, warning that the Australian government will step in if elderly residents are locked in their rooms without access to visitors.\nThe prime minister has also rejected teachers\u2019 union calls for physical distancing in classrooms before schools can return, arguing it is not supported by medical advice and \u201cnot a credible requirement\u201d to insist on 1.5 metres between students or 4 sq metres of personal space in such settings.\nAddressing reporters in Canberra after the latest meeting of the national cabinet, Morrison confirmed he was working with state and territory leaders on plans to resume community sport as the country moved into the \u201cnext phase\u201d of the coronavirus response.\nMorrison announced that parliament would resume on 12, 13 and 14 May, a move welcomed by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who suggested the next session would need to deal with \u201cimportant privacy legislation\u201d to protect information gathered by Australia\u2019s contact tracing app.\nMorrison confirmed the ABC report that data collected from the app, still under development but soon to be released, would be stored by Amazon Web Services.\nBut Morrison said the servers would be located in Australia and \u201cit will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than\u201d people conducting contract tracing, rejecting the thrust of the story that data would be within reach of US intelligence services.\nOn Friday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, also announced a raft of changes expanding eligibility for the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy, including allowing charities to exclude government revenue from the reduction in turnover needed to access the program.\n\u201cThis will help to ensure that the eligibility of charities is not adversely affected where they are delivering significant services that are funded by government,\u201d Frydenberg said.\nThe move is designed to help charities which run services including child care, homelessness and aged care.\nThe government will also provide an alternative decline in turnover test for special purpose service entities that employ staff who then work in related entities in a company group. The new test will examine the turnover decline of the related entities using the services of the employer entity.\nEarlier, Morrison said national cabinet had reiterated its concerns about some aged care providers imposing restrictions on visitors above and beyond the national rules.\nMorrison acknowledged it was \u201centirely sensible\u201d to have tougher rules in some places such as in north-west Tasmania and western Sydney due to local outbreaks, but this should be an exception rather than a rule.\n\u201cMore broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are not going to have these as secret places, where people can\u2019t access them.\u201d\nMorrison warned that if he did not see an \u201cimprovement\u201d on a voluntary basis, he would move towards a mandatory system where aged care providers had to apply for permission to stray from the rules.\nAs New South Wales has announced a phased return to face-to-face teaching in term two and the Australian Capital Territory prepares a plan to do the same, the argument is slowly turning in the commonwealth\u2019s favour that schools should be reopened.\nBut a return to full face-to-face learning is opposed by Victoria, based on its own medical advice, and the New South Wales Teachers Federation, which has called for physical distancing in classrooms.\nOn Friday Morrison reiterated that schools did not need to impose the rules, telling Sky News \u201cthe 1.5m [distance] and the 4 sq metre [rules] are not required, based on the health advice, so suggestions that are coming from that group that this is necessary \u2013 that\u2019s just not true, that\u2019s not a credible requirement\u201d.\nThe Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advised it believes the \u201cvenue density\u201d rules are not \u201cappropriate or practical in classrooms or corridors\u201d. However, on 16 April the AHPPC did note that schools were taking such measures to \u201cminimise risk\u201d.\nMorrison said physical distancing should apply in the staff room, lunch room and at the pick-up and drop-off of school children but the risk in classrooms was \u201cno different\u201d to workers in supermarkets or bus drivers.\nEarlier, at the press conference, he said parents who were trying to work from home while also trying to help the children learn was \u201cnot working too well\u201d for them.\n\u201cSo when we can get back to the point where we can have kids back at school, and we can get people back at work, then I think we\u2019re going to see that also lift our economy in ways that we very much need.\u201d\nNational cabinet agreed to a set of \u201csafe workplace principles\u201d, asking employers to consult with workers to understand risks and introduce hygiene and physical distancing measures.\nThe government also released the latest update to its modelling on how the virus was spreading in Australia. The effective rate of transmission remains below 1, although experts urged against complacency.\nJodie McVernon, a professor at the University of Melbourne and director of Doherty Epidemiology, said the modelling team had updated its assumptions about the spread of infections by returned travellers because strong quarantine measures had been put in place.\nThat meant the estimate of the effective rate of transmission was \u201ca bit higher than our previous report, but still below the critical threshold of 1 needed to prevent case numbers from increasing, confirming that current public health and distancing measures are working\u201d.\nAccording to the revised estimates, the reproduction rate remains above 1 in Tasmania, and just below in Western Australia and Queensland.",

Companies will also be able to book them for employees.\nPeople who register will receive a text or email with an appointment at one of 48 drive-through centres or can request a home test kit. However, moments after the website went live on Friday morning all the home tests for key workers had already gone.\nA note on the government website said: \u201cCurrently, only drive-through tests available. We\u2019ve issued today\u2019s allocation of home test kits. If you need a home test kit, check back here tomorrow, when more will be available. You can continue if you\u2019re able to visit a drive-through test centre.\u201d\nHancock said testing was \u201cslow at the beginning of the month\u201d but claimed the government was ahead of its plan to be able to test 100,000 people a day by May.\n\u201cThe reason why the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month is because we have been building these symptoms to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\u201cWe are ahead of our internal plan for where we expected the amount of capacity to be and we have got a week left to hit that goal.\u201d\nAsked if he thought the 100,000 target would be met, he replied: \u201cI do, yes, but nothing is guaranteed in life.\u201d\nA help desk has been set up to aid the process, and 48 mobile units run by the army will travel around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Hancock added: \u201cNot as many people have been coming for [a test] as we had expected. Of course that was a problem but it\u2019s a good problem because it means we\u2019ve been able to expand who can get a test faster than we had planned.\n\u201cThey will start in small numbers but that service will grow, and I think that will be a popular service as it increasingly becomes available.\u201d\nThe government also announced a contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d. Eighteen thousand people, including 3,000 clinicians, will be recruited to work on contact tracing, supporting an NHS mobile phone app that will automatically log users\u2019 contacts and warn them if they have been close to someone who tests positive.\nHancock said these steps would be crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease. \u201cThey work far better when there are fewer new cases but, if they work as they have done in other countries, then they will be able to hold down the number of new cases with fewer social distancing restrictions, which is why they are so important to get in place in large scale.\u201d",

On Friday 1 May at 1300 BST, we\u2019ll be live for an hour or so and you can reserve your free ticket here.\nTwo weeks ago we posted a link to a podcast with the modern-day sage Mo Gawdat.

And we\u2019ll take your questions.\nIt\u2019ll be experimental, rough around the edges, but maybe just the start of something. And if nothing else, we\u2019ll always have the Upside journalism to fall back on, pieces like:\nHow Europe is tiptoeing back to life.

Though it\u2019s early days, it will be interesting to see if this kind of service takes off and sustains its appeal.\nAnd finally, this factual explainer on how quickly we might get to a vaccine was published by the Wellcome Trust.\nBarbara Feeney, recently repatriated to Dublin from Melbourne, wrote in praise of the simple hug:\nIn Iceland, the country\u2019s forestry service has recommended that people hug a tree once a day during lockdown, to aid relaxation and boost their sense of wellbeing. Rangers are recommending a daily five-minute tree hug. A rather peculiar instruction, but there\u2019s something quite lovely about it too.\nThis got me thinking about hugging. Before now I had never thought a lot about hugging. I suppose it\u2019s just one of those things we do on automatic pilot.\nThere\u2019s a lot to be said for technology and how it can connect us and help us feel less alone, but nothing makes up for a good hug. So, while I wait for a government-approved hug, I\u2019ll keep hugging my teddy and maybe give the Icelandic tree-hugging a go!\nDede Callichy meanwhile got in touch from Byron Bay, Australia:\nMy greatest reasons for gratitude are crystal-clear air, much quieter streets, more respect and kindness between people, and the dedication of those making big donations and those in service \u2013 medical staff, supermarkets, meal takeaway outlets, garbage collectors, teachers ... and the list goes on. Thank you all.\nBrooke Fandrich from Wisconsin is relishing the chance to take stock:\nOver this lengthy period of social distancing, I\u2019ve felt like the \u2018mute button\u2019 has been pressed on my life. The typical noise of my days has been silenced, and that\u2019s made a huge impact since we\u2019ve finally been given some time to be alone with our own thoughts. It seems like people are using their isolation as an opportunity for self-reflection and healing. During social distancing, I\u2019ve realized that myself and many others were experiencing chronic stress in our old daily life. We were finally able to work up the courage and get professional psychiatric help. Many members of my family are coming out about their own mental health, and it seemed like every website I went to for professional help gave a notice that they were receiving a significant number of new patients during the pandemic.\nI know that social isolation is extremely harmful to overall wellbeing, and many people are suffering from social distancing, but a lot of us have actually been encouraged by it to start speaking up for ourselves. It may be interesting for you to research if the world of professional psychological care has really been experiencing an overall wave of new patients during the pandemic. All these changes have exposed serious faults in the way our society was being run, and I think that goes down to the most basic individual level.\nIt would be amazing if this crisis has encouraged people to reach out for the help that they\u2019ve needed for so long. Thanks for the positives.\nAnd thank you, Brooke.\nWith everyone out there who is still singing.",

Neville had been due to take charge of Team GB in Tokyo this summer, however the FA remained vague on whether he would remain in post for the postponed competition, likely wishing to keep the option on the table when discussing the post with potential successors.\nThe FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football, Sue Campbell said: \u201cIn light of the impact of current global events on the sporting calendar and in the best interests of the England Women\u2019s team, both parties were in agreement that our shared priority was to ensure the Lionesses have continuity of coaching going into the home Euros and looking towards the 2023 World Cup.\n\u201cOnce football returns after this difficult period, Phil will continue his work with the Lionesses on the further development of his squad. I will support him fully with that important task whilst moving forward with the crucial succession planning process.\n\u201cWe will now discuss next steps with the British Olympic Association and the home nations with regard to Team GB Football and we are not in a position to make any further comment at this time.\u201d\nWith Uefa having confirmed the postponement of the Euros until 2022, Neville now misses out on leading the Lionesses at a second major tournament \u2013 the Euros initially fell within his contract term.\nNeville said: \u201cAs a result of the changes to the proposed tournament scheduling we will now be working to plan for a revised match calendar once it is safe and appropriate to do so. I am looking forward to getting back to work with the team as soon as possible. We have a fantastic squad of players and there is plenty to work on as we look to progress as a team going into 2021.\u201d",

        "content": "Nothing better sums up my experience of being a lower-league fan than a goalless draw against a team with eight men\nOn 28 December 1999, Cambridge United drew 0-0 at home to Cardiff City in Division Two (now League One). Nothing remarkable there. Until you realise that Cardiff City had three men sent off \u2013 one for deliberate handball on the line. Yet Cambridge still couldn\u2019t get three points.\nMy memories of standing on the north terrace that day are pretty hazy. But I distinctly remember being excited that David Elleray was the referee. Who knows what mistake he\u2019d made in the Premier League the week before to be sent down to our level but he was by some distance the most famous person on the pitch. And he meant business.\nHe sent off one of their players before half-time, another with half an hour to go. Finally, with seven or eight minutes left, their substitute Lee Phillips made a decent save and Ellery gave the penalty and sent Phillips off.\nBy then the atmosphere in our end was a mixture of disbelief and hilarity. Eleven v nine was ridiculous enough. It was a training game. But we just could not score. We barely looked like scoring.\nAs Martin Butler placed the ball on the spot \u2013 against eight men \u2013 I obviously wanted him to score. We\u2019d had our fun. We\u2019d laughed at how we couldn\u2019t beat nine men. Now we\u2019d have both victory and a funny story for later. Butler was a lovely footballer and a decent penalty taker. But Jon Hallworth \u2013 all blonde hair and blonde eyebrows \u2013 saved it, and Cardiff held on, very briefly going down to seven men when one of their players was stretchered off in injury time.\nI urge anyone to listen to the Cardiff commentary from that day. I recently mentioned the game on a podcast and the commentator Phil Stead got in touch. \u201cI had just started working for the club and recorded it on a dictaphone to try it out as a new fangled audio download. It was my first and last commentary. We played it on the bus speakers on the way home.\u201d\nAs a one and only commentary, it is sensational \u2013 improved by the terrible audio quality and the fact he\u2019s just standing in the away end. The words without the atmosphere don\u2019t do them justice, but it\u2019s quite the monologue.\n\u201cElleray must blow up any second. We\u2019re in the third minute of injury time \u2026 And it\u2019s all over and Cardiff City celebrate as they draw 0-0 with eight men. A remarkable performance. Cambridge United nil, Cardiff City nil. And we celebrate! We celebrate as if we\u2019ve won the European Champions League! A great day in the history of Cardiff City. And this is emotional \u2026 this is emotional here in Cambridge. This is what it\u2019s all about. Cardiff City! The greatest team in the world. Richie Humphries come here my son. And he goes into the City crowd. The man\u2019s a hero. They are all heroes \u2026 We are surely the greatest team in the history of football. This is what it\u2019s all about. Man United? No. Chelsea? No. Tottenham? No. Barcelona? No. Real Madrid? No. Cardiff City. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about!\u201d\nSadly for Cardiff, we beat them 4-0 at Ninian Park when it was 11 versus 11 and they got relegated that season, finishing four points below us.\nFrom a Cambridge perspective, this game epitomises what it means to be a lower league fan. Most of it is bad. Occasionally hilariously bad.\nThere have been great victories - Chesterfield in the first play-off final at Wembley in 1990. Those cup runs in the 90s \u2013 5-1 v Bristol City in a fifth-round replay in 1990 and 4-0 over Sheffield Wednesday the following year. There have even been stoic defeats - 2-1 to Arsenal in 1991, when Dion Dublin equalised and David O\u2019Leary should have been sent off, but nothing sums up my supporting experience better than a goalless draw against eight men.",

        "content": "Misclassification raises fears of hidden health emergencies in one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable populations\nNative Americans are being left out of demographic data on the impact of the coronavirus across the US, raising fears of hidden health emergencies in one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\nA Guardian analysis found that about 80% of state health departments have released some racial demographic data, which has already revealed stark disparities in the impact of Covid-19 in black and Latinx communities. But of those states, almost half did not explicitly include Native Americans in their breakdowns and instead categorized them under the label \u201cother\u201d.\n\u201cBy including us in the other category it effectively eliminates us in the data,\u201d Abigail Echo-Hawk (Pawnee), director, urban Indian health board and chief research officer, Seattle Indian Health Board, told the Guardian.\nIn states that do categorize Native Americans in the demographic results, early data indicates dramatically disproportionate rates of infection and death. Last week, the Arizona department of health services reported that Native Americans make up 16% of the state\u2019s Covid-19 related deaths, despite representing only 6% of the state\u2019s population. In New Mexico, Native Americans make up less than 10% of the population but over one-third of coronavirus cases.\nThis week, the health authority for the Navajo Nation, which includes areas of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, reported 1,197 positive coronavirus cases and 44 deaths. If it were a state, it would rank third in the country for confirmed cases per 100,000 population, behind only New York and New Jersey (though the nation is also testing at a far higher rate than most states).\nCommunities of color are not more susceptible to coronavirus, but because of years of unequal access to healthcare, clean water and nutritious food, they are at greater risk of developing complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Native Americans experience diabetes three times more than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States, and have the highest rates of asthma. Before the pandemic, the federal health system serving Native Americans was already chronically underfunded.\nThe Guardian found health departments did not include Native Americans in their racial demographic data even in areas with high numbers of Native residents. The majority of Native Americans live in urban areas, with the highest populations in New York City and Los Angeles. But neither explicitly include Native Americans in the breakdowns of their Covid-19 data.\nThe NYC department of health and mental hygiene did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. The Los Angeles county department of public health said it was \u201clooking into getting more accurate information on the race/ethnicity field\u201d and hoped to provide \u201cmore meaningful reports on this in the future\u201d.\nHalf of all American Indian and Alaskan Natives live in just 10 states, according to the US Census Bureau. As of 21 April, all 10 had published some racial demographic data, but four \u2013 Texas, Florida, New York and Michigan \u2013 had not included a breakdown for Native Americans. A spokesperson for the Texas department of state health services said that Native Americans were categorized as \u201cother\u201d because their case numbers were small compared with other groups.\n\u201cWe are a small population of people because of genocide. No other reason,\u201d said Echo-Hawk. \u201cIf you eliminate us in the data, we don\u2019t exist. We don\u2019t exist for the allocation of resources.\u201d\nLeaving Native Americans out of public health data is not new in the US. For example in January, the CDC released its most comprehensive study to date on race and maternal mortality rates, but American Indians and Alaskan Natives were not included. When the Urban Indian Health Institute did its own research, it found Native women living in cities were 4.5 times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women.\nHealth experts have also warned that local and state health departments that are including Native Americans in their demographic data are still likely to be undercounting Native Covid-19 patients and deaths due to racial misclassification.\nAccording to some studies, Native Americans have a 50% chance of being listed as the wrong race on medical records, as well as birth and death certificates. A 2015 study of hospital discharge records in Oregon found that over half of Native patients had been miscategorized on their file, the majority as white. A separate 2014 study found that 30% of Native American patients had been miscategorized on their death certificates.\nThe Indian Health Services (IHS), a chronically underfunded federal healthcare system that serves 2.5 million tribal citizens in 37 states, has been publishing testing results daily during the coronavirus outbreak.\nWhile not every Native person accesses healthcare through IHS, the system ought to be best placed to provide a snapshot of the impact of the Covid-19 in Indian country. But IHS cannot track hospitalization or mortality data for most of its patients, because the majority of IHS facilities do not provide intensive care, and so critically ill patients are transferred to non-IHS hospitals.\nThe \u201cIHS may not be notified of deaths\u201d wrote an agency spokesperson. Therefore \u201cto avoid underreporting\u201d, IHS is only publishing testing results, they said.\nBut testing numbers are also incomplete. The IHS includes a network of facilities operated  by the IHS, tribal health services, and urban providers. Only IHS direct service facilities are required to report their data , representing about 17% of the facilities in the system. For all others, data sharing is voluntary. According to an IHS spokesperson, about a third of tribally run and urban facilities have reported their numbers.\nIHS is also hampered by an electronic record system that was developed in the 1980s. An IHS spokesperson said \u201ca replacement is necessary\u201d but in the meantime, \u201cCovid-19 surveillance data is being collected manually\u201d.\n\u201cHealth disparities are nice words for systematic racism \u2026 it\u2019s the residual effects of the founding of this country,\u201d social demographer Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear (Cheyenne) told the Guardian.\nBut Rodriguez-Lonebear said it was not enough to just include Native Americans in demographic data; the data also needs to include tribal affiliation. For tribal governments, she said, \u201cbeing able to identify who your citizens are in these big data sets is so vital to being able to understand the impact of the virus on your tribe\u201d.\nUnlike states and counties, tribes cannot rely on healthcare systems to tell them when their citizens are sick or dying and must collect the data themselves. The Guardian asked 15 state and local health departments with high Native populations if they were collecting tribal affiliation. None reported doing so.\n\u201cWe wish we had the resources to drill down to the tribal affiliation; however, we are not able to at this point,\u201d a spokesperson for Maricopa county, which includes the city of Phoenix, said.\nThe only public national coronavirus database reporting tribal affiliation is being run by the independent Native newspaper, Indian Country Today, whose team of 16 people has been adding the positive Covid-19 cases and deaths they can verify to a daily report on their website.\n\u201cOften researchers and legislators say there is no data\u201d on health issues affecting Indian country, said Jourdan Bennett-Begay (Navajo), ICT\u2019s Washington editor. But she did not want that to happen after this pandemic. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be forgotten\u201d.\nICT\u2019s database is already being used by a team of indigenous researchers at UCLA and the University of Arizona, that includes Rodriguez-Lonebear, to look at characteristics \u2013 such as a lack of access to running water, that might be facilitating the spread of Covid-19 in Indian country and what interventions could potentially slow down a second wave. In Navajo Nation, for instance, one in three people do not have access to running water or electricity.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren and congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, both Democrats, joined others to introduce a bill last week calling for consultation with tribal governments on federal data collection and an additional $3m for Indian Health Services.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t see,\u201d Warren said last week. \u201cIf we want to slow the spread of the virus and ensure our response is robust and equitable, we need comprehensive data on who is getting tested, who is getting treatment, and who is dying.\u201d\nThe bill did not address racial misclassification or data collection on tribal affiliation.\nHowever, Echo-Hawk thinks it is already too late to be accurately represented in the data about the current outbreak.\n\u201cWith what we\u2019re seeing right now, there will absolutely be a gross undercount of the effects of Covid on American Indian and Alaska Native peoples,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to prepare for the next wave.\u201d",

She knew that she needed help, but was scared about contracting coronavirus if she went to the hospital.\n\u201cA young woman with existing problems, isolated in a stressful home situation without support with thoughts of taking her own life \u2026 that\u2019s a high-risk perfect storm,\u201d said Henderson, who works at the Crisis Center in Birmingham, Alabama, part of the national suicide prevention lifeline network.\nShe\u2019s not the only one. Every aspect of normal life has been turned upside down by the strict physical distancing measures to mitigate the pandemic, which has already claimed almost 50,000 lives and 26m jobs in the US. With no end in sight, the mental health consequences of Covid-19 are starting to manifest \u2013 fuelled by the devastating mix of uncertainty, isolation, grief and economic despair.\nNationwide, crisis services are trying to deal with the immediate aftermath. But the country\u2019s weak mental health system may not be able to meet rising demand.\nCounsellors on the crisis text line, a global SMS helpline typically utilized by teens with relationship issues, said they were dealing with a 40% increase in messages in the US. The demographics have changed radically: now, over-35-year-olds are the most frequent users, with those on low incomes accounting for 31% of traffic \u2013 compared with 19% before the pandemic.\n\u201cIn the first wave people were anxious, but now in the second wave people are feeling depressed and isolated, especially very poor people and those in violent situations,\u201d said Nancy Lublin, the CEO and co-founder.\nIn Alabama, calls to the hotline are up 50% since the start of the pandemic, with a big rise in isolated young people and rural dwellers worried about finances. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in suicidal ideation among people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, worrying about how they\u2019re going to feed their families,\u201d said Meg McGlamery, executive director of the Crisis Center.\nIn California, calls to a disaster distress line more than tripled between February and March, and are on track to rise another 50% this month, according to Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of callers to this national hotline are anxious about Covid-19 .\nAs the economic fallout deepens, mental health advocates warn about the potentially devastating impact on millions of Americans. \u201cWe fully expect a jump in calls to the suicide prevention lifeline in the next couple of months as people remain unemployed, lose their homes and can\u2019t pay the bills,\u201d said Lyn Morris, the senior vice-president of clinical operations at Didi Hirsch.\nThere\u2019s precedent for that dire outlook. In the aftermath of the 2007 recession in North America and Europe, about 10,000 more people, mostly middle-aged and older men, committed suicide than expected in a two-year span.\nBut it\u2019s not just about isolation or financial dire straits \u2013 the pandemic has its own specific victims. The number of Asian Americans using the national crisis text line has doubled, counsellors say, amid a wave of harassment and bullying probably linked to the racist rhetoric spouted by Trump and some of his supporters who blame China for the spread of the virus.\nRequests for help from domestic violence victims are also up by a third at the crisis text line. The world over, home is the most dangerous place for women and children \u2013 a grim reality exacerbated by physical distancing and travel restrictions.\nIn Alabama, Henderson recalled a call from a woman desperate to flee a violent partner but who was scared of being arrested if she crossed state lines. In another case, the center struggled to find emergency shelter for a rape survivor.\nChildren are often the most vulnerable during public health crises. There is particular concern for those with pre-existing psychological issues, and those cooped up with an abuser or an adult with substance misuse problems, mental health experts said.\nIn order to mitigate the risks, one school counselor in New Jersey told Lisa Athan, a grief specialist, that she holds up a paper sign with \u201ccan you speak freely?\u201d to which the child responds with a nod or shake of the head.\nAthan said children are struggling to process grief as normal rituals associated with death such as saying goodbye and funerals are almost impossible.\n\u201cWithout these rituals, deaths don\u2019t feel real, and children feel helpless, anxious, angry and too upset to concentrate on school work,\u201d said Athan, who is trying to teach mindfulness and yoga virtually. \u201cNow they see protesters [on TV] who want businesses reopened while their teachers and grandparents are still dying \u2026 it makes them feel angry, that these people don\u2019t care.\u201d\nThe unresolved grief and trauma from the pandemic, meanwhile, can increase the risk of complex problems such as depression, substance misuse, physical complaints and violence.\nCrisis services and clinicians have scrambled to adapt by rolling out virtual therapy and telehealth consultations. But the country\u2019s inadequate mental health infrastructure, means this is unlikely to be enough.\n\u201cThe US mental health system is patchy at best and faces being overwhelmed by the likely substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, domestic violence and child abuse,\u201d said Sandro Galea, the dean of Boston University\u2019s school of public health.\nIn 2018, there were 27.9 million people without health insurance, and record-high unemployment will increase that figure.\nRecruitment and training of mental heath professionals has also fallen way behind: the Department of Health and Human Services predicts widespread staffing shortfalls by 2025 including up to 57,000 psychologists, 14,000 psychiatrists and 48,000 mental health and substance abuse social workers.\nEven before the pandemic, half of adults with mental illness did not receive treatment, according to the National Association of Mental Illness (Nami) which has seen calls to its helpline rise by 40% during the pandemic.\nAs the need for mental health services rises, access to adequate and timely help will probably decline \u2013 unless drastic steps are taken now to expand digital outreach, improve surveillance to detect abuse, and fund services, according to Galea.\nEven then, the repercussions are likely to be felt well after the peak of the pandemic.\n\u201cThe mental health curve is going to have a long tail,\u201d said Dr Ken Duckworth, the chief medical officer for Nami. \u201cWhen life finally returns to normal, the following year will not be a good one for mental health.\u201d\n If you need mental health support you can find help 24 hours a day:\nText HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis text line counsellor\nCall the national suicide prevention lifeline on 1-800-273-8255\nCall 1-800-985-5990 for the national disaster distress helpline",

It is a sharp increase that appears to dash hopes that the country has reached a plateau in its battle against the virus. The near-record jump in cases brought the total to 68,622, with nearly half of those in Moscow. Sixty people with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 615, Russia\u2019s official crisis response centre said.\nDonald Trump has said Boris Johnson sounded \u201cincredible\u201d on a phone call with him after he was discharged from hospital, prompting speculation that the prime minister will return to work soon. The US president revealed details of their conversation at one of his regular press conferences in which he claimed Johnson, who was in intensive care with coronavirus earlier this month, sounded \u201cready to go\u201d.\nThe Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Friday, with some countries easing restrictions and others tightening them. Egypt is to ease its coronavirus lockdown by allowing more businesses to reopen and shortening a nighttime curfew. The United Arab Emirates has cut a nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours to now run daily from 10pm-6am, instead of from 8pm.\nTrump also said he may extend federal social distancing guidelines to the summer. It came as Congress approved a $484bn coronavirus relief package, taking to nearly $3tn the money pledged so far. Also in the US, the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren revealed her older brother had died after contracting Covid-19.\nThe number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a month, with 367 new deaths reported on Friday, Reuters has reported. The latest update took the total number of deaths to 22,524 from 22,157 the day before, the health ministry said. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 219,764 from 213,024 the day before.\nSouth Korea reported just six more cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours before midnight on Friday, raising the total number of infections to 10,708. There were no deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 16 March \u2013 39 days. The death toll is now 240, or 2.24%.\nChina has published its daily coronavirus figures, reporting just six new cases and no new deaths.\nThe French president said the government aimed to release its detailed end of lockdown plan \u201cprobably on Tuesday\u201d. Speaking to a group of mayors by video-conference on Friday, Emmanuel Macron said managing the return to normal life was a \u201clogistical and organisational challenge\u201d.",

        "content": "In 1972 M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad Robinson and her husband Tim, the writer and cartographer, left their home in West Hampstead, London, for the west of Ireland, where they lived for more than 40 years. M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad, the mysterious and beloved \u201cM\u201d of Tim\u2019s books, was his creative partner, his office manager and the publisher of his maps through their imprint, Folding Landscapes.\nM\u00e1ir\u00e9ad, who has died aged 85, also had her own life as an independent scholar and activist. The Robinsons returned frequently to a flat in London, and her community activism in West Hampstead in the 1970s and 1980s during winter breaks was mainly focused on housing. She was vice-chair of West Hampstead Housing Association and a committee member of West Hampstead Housing Co-op. Both organisations provided low-rent, nonprofit housing, and enabled many young people to live in London. She also championed the community theatre group Mombasa Roadshow.\nM\u00e1ir\u00e9ad was born Margaret Fitzgibbon in Loch Garman, County Wexford, and first moved to London in the 1950s to train as a lawyer. She mastered Gaelic, Italian and French, and read Latin and ancient Greek. Her reading was eclectic, ranging from Dante to the memoirs of 18th-century French aristocratic women\u2019s salons.\nShe met Tim Robinson when, as recent graduates, they were renting rooms in the same shared house, and they married in Islington in 1959. They moved to Istanbul to teach and later to Vienna, where Tim began to develop his work as a visual artist. On their return to London, in the 1960s he exhibited under the name Timothy Drever and M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad worked as a manager at Camden Arts Centre.\nI first met her around 1970 or 1971 at a London arts event and we soon became close friends. By then, life in the capital was becoming more difficult for artists and Tim was keen to leave what he described as the \u201cegotistical dynamism of the London art world\u201d after an aimless, wandering year, despite successful exhibitions in 1969 and 1970.\nWhen I went round to visit her in 1972, I was shocked to see M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad had chopped off her hair in preparation for their move to Ireland, prompted by viewing Robert Flaherty\u2019s film Man of Aran. The couple lived at first on Inis M\u00f3r, the largest of the Aran Islands, and in 1984 they moved to the tiny harbour village of Roundstone, in Connemara.\nThere, M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad established Folding Landscapes, a small press that printed and sold Tim\u2019s maps. They repurposed an abandoned lace-making factory overlooking the Roundstone harbour as a home, studio and walled garden. It has been described both as a \u201cmonastery built for two\u201d and as one of the most beautiful buildings in Ireland, with stunning views over the bay to the mountains.\nM\u00e1ir\u00e9ad was a brilliant host. Among the many events she and Tim ran were the annual Conversations, where scientists and artists would discuss their work; University of Galway poetry summer schools and symposia; and intensive screen writing courses. Their regatta party would see her catering for the scores of visitors who watched the red-sailed old hooker ships from their terrace.\nAfter a visit to West Hampstead at the end of 2015, they were prevented by ill-health from returning to Roundstone. Tim survived M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad by two weeks.",

The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown:\nHealth and social careFrontline health and social care staff such as doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, as well as support and specialist staff in the health and social care sector. In addition it includes those working in supply chains including producers and distributors of medicines and personal protective equipment.\nEducation and childcareNursery, teaching staff and social workers.\nKey public servicesThose required to run the justice system, religious staff, as well as those responsible for managing the deceased, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.\nLocal and national governmentAdministrative occupations essential to the effective delivery of the Covid-19 response or delivering essential public services.\nFood and other necessary goodsThose involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food.\nPublic safety and national securityPolice, support staff, Ministry of Defence civilian staff and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue staff, and those responsible for border security, prisons and probation.\nTransportThose who will keep air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating.\nUtilities, communication and financial servicesStaff required to keep oil, gas, electricity, water and sewerage operations running. Staff in the civil nuclear, chemical and telecommunications sectors. Those in postal services and those working to provide essential financial services.\nBut within three hours of the site launching, anyone accessing the self-referral test site was told that applications had closed.\nA message said: \u201cYou can\u2019t currently register for a Covid-19 test. Please check back here later.\u201d\nThe Department for Health and Social Care blamed the problems on \u201csignificant demand\u201d. In a tweet it apologised for the inconvenience and promised more tests would be available on Saturday.\nThere has been significant demand for booking tests today. We apologise for any inconvenience. We are continuing to rapidly increase availability. More tests will be available tomorrow.\nThe Labour MP Toby Perkins, the shadow minister for apprenticeships, was among many who received the message about closed applications.\nWhen I click on the link, it says Coronavirus test- applications closed. Is there a link that works that I can share @grantshapps ?\nAnd those who did get through earlier were told that Friday\u2019s allocation of home test kits had already been issued.\nThe problems took the gloss off Hancock\u2019s launch of the self-referral system, which he said was \u201ccritical\u201d to ramping up testing.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio\u2019s Today programme before the problems emerged he said: \u201cIf you have symptoms or somebody else in your household has symptoms, then you can go online to Gov.uk and self-refer for a test \u2013 that\u2019s a new system up and running this morning.\u201d\nHe said until now there had not been enough people coming forward for tests despite the increase in capacity. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have, because it means that we can then expand the amount of those who are eligible and critically we\u2019ve been able to bring in this new online booking system that opened, six o\u2019clock this morning, so that if you\u2019re an essential worker, you can just book yourself instead of going through what was a quite a complicated route through your employer.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt was always part of the plan to bring in this new booking system. We only finished writing the code yesterday. So it\u2019s been an unbelievable effort by the technical people to build this new system \u2026 The reason that the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month was because we\u2019ve been building these systems to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed. So we\u2019re ahead of the plan, but you know, many a slip between cup and lip.\u201d\nAsked whether he thought the government would meet the target of 100,000 tests a day by next Thursday, Hancock said: \u201cI do, yes, but nothing\u2019s guaranteed in life.\u201d",

        "content": "The pressing need to find a solution to the pandemic means risks and shortcuts may have to be taken\nThe stakes could hardly be higher; the prize still tantalisingly out of reach. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 \u2013 the only sure escape route from the pandemic.\nYet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University\u2019s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.\nThe vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.\nSo what is the path to success?\nTraditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.\nThe approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won\u2019t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly \u2013 especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.\nA slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.\nSo it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach.\nThe rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn\u2019t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or \u201ccorona\u201d around the virus.\nAdvances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists\u2019 creativity in developing this defence.\nTeams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.\nBut many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week\u2019s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.\nAnd then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?\nFirst into clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.\nRNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside the nuclei of cells, to the cell\u2019s protein-making factories outside the nucleus.\nIn this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London\u2019s team, this week backed by \u00a322.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn\u2019t been tested before in people.\n\u201cSome groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,\u201d said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that luxury. It\u2019s probably cost us one or two months, but it\u2019s much better to be cautious and be sure you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s really safe.\u201d\nAlso testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.\nBoth are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don\u2019t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as \u201cnon-replicating viral vectors\u201d.\nThese teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go.\nA third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.\nIts vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.\nThis might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .\n\u201cClearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,\u201d said Joseph Kim, Inovio\u2019s CEO. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\nFinally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.\nThis is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.\nIt\u2019s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.\n\u201cSome vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the challenge that we face is that there\u2019s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You\u2019re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.\u201d\nA few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.\nThere is a chance none of them will work.\nFor some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.\nThe truth is we\u2019re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.\n\u201cReasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,\u201d according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing may need to continue until 2022. \u201cOn the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It\u2019s really speculative at this point.\u201d\nOn the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.\nThere are also questions around the type of immunity required.\nThe body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.\n\u201cAn ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,\u201d said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.\nThere is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. \u201cYou need a certain hit rate in the population you\u2019re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,\u201d said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England\u2019s National Infection Service at Porton Down.\nThe possibility of \u201cchallenge trials\u201d, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this \u2026 because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,\u201d said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.\nVaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.\nShattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial\u2019s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.\n\u201cWe can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cMany other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It\u2019s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we\u2019ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.\u201d\n\u201cIf our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well \u2013 and that\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we could deploy it in the UK this winter,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cAll these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.\u201d\nBy September there could be a vaccine \u2013 maybe several \u2013 that appear broadly safe and effective.\nThat\u2019s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under \u201cemergency use\u201d rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.\nThere are precedents for this \u2013 in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.\n\u201cThat might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people\u2019s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,\u201d said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.\nBut very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past \u2013 recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.\nThe principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. \u201cIn this case, that would include the fact that if you\u2019re being offered a vaccine in October that didn\u2019t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.\u201d\nIndividuals could be faced with tough choices \u2013 take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.\nAt the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.\nBut multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.\nOthers urge a unified approach; governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.\nNational governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.\n\u201cIf vaccine nationalism asserts itself, you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cIt\u2019s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can\u2019t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can\u2019t deal with this one country at a time.\u201d\nHatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. \u201cIn global health terms that\u2019s a very big number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that\u2019s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that\u2019s a really good investment.\u201d\n This article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell, rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in \u201cThe frontrunners\u201d section.",

        "content": "Emmanuel Ambunya Oyombe pleads not guilty over fatal shooting of Carilton Maina in Nairobi in December 2018\nA Kenyan police officer has appeared before a Nairobi court charged with the murder of 23-year-old Carilton Maina, a former Leeds University student, who was shot dead in December 2018.\nThe charging of police constable Emmanuel Ambunya Oyombe marks a significant milestone in the Kenyan government\u2019s commitment to tackling its issue with questionable police shootings, and to speeding up its justice process in bringing those accused to trial.\nThe Milimani high court hearing on Thursday was held outdoors, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the first time this has happened in Kenya since the 1950s state of emergency.\nOyombe, who remains a serving police office, pleaded not guilty to murder. A trial date has not yet been set.\nHe was arrested last week, according to an announcement made on social media by Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations. The director said the officer would be charged with the murder of Maina, who \u201csuccumbed to gunshot wounds inflicted on him by the said officer\u201d.\nIrungu Houghton, Amnesty International\u2019s director in Kenya, who has been lobbying the government to do more to stop such incidents, said on Thursday he had taken a keen interest in the case and welcomed the investigation.\nMaina\u2019s mother, Josephine Wangare, was in court, supported by a legal team from Amnesty. She said seeing someone brought to court to face trial had restored her faith in justice.\n\u201cI am grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cThe death of my son Carilton has been very painful for us and his friends. He was greatly loved. After a year with no one prosecuted for his death I had begun to despair.\u201d\nMaina was raised in Kibera, Africa\u2019s largest slum. A straight-A student, he showed exceptional talent, which eventually earned him a scholarship to Leeds University in the UK. He had returned to Kibera over the Christmas holidays and was walking home on 22 December from watching a televised football match with friends when they met two police officers.\nIt is said that there was an exchange of words and Maina ran from the officers. At Laini Saba, a short instance from the home where he lived with his grandmother, he was hit by four bullets to his body and head.\nLast year the Guardian interviewed Josephine Wangare about the killing, which had sparked outrage in the local community. Students took to the streets in protest with placards demanding \u201cJustice for Maina\u201d.\nThe court case comes against a background of Kenya\u2019s questionably high police-related deaths \u2013 referred to as \u201cextrajudicial killings\u201d by communities and local news reports \u2013 often shootings after street interventions or stops.\nIn an attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and people in Kibera, the Kenyan police have been carrying out a community engagement programme aimed at building trust and rooting out those who prey on the vulnerable. Gang rape, murder and robbery are all too common occurrences in the slums. Officers are targets for criminals and gangs in slums such as Kiberathat are dangerous and difficult to patrol. Several have been killed over the past few years.\nKenya\u2019s government claims to be making an effort to weed out the rogue officers among its 60,000-strong police force. As of March 2018, the country\u2019s Independent Policing Oversight Authority was monitoring 9,878 outstanding complaints against police, of which 5,085 were earmarked for detailed investigation.\n This article was amended on 29 April 2020 to remove an erroneous reference to the city of Kisumu as a \u201cslum\u201d.",

        "content": "Health professionals, experts and unions say poorly fitting equipment is risking lives of female workers\nSome talk of abrasions on their faces caused by having to pull masks too tight, others about having to roll up the sleeves of their fluid-repellent gowns. Some have been left barely able to see, while others have used micropore tape to seal gaps around their jawline. The thing they all have in common? They are trying to save lives \u2013 and they are women.\nNHS professional bodies, experts and trade unions have warned that female healthcare workers\u2019 lives are being put at risk because personal protective equipment is designed for men. As one frontline NHS worker put it: \u201cPPE is designed for a 6 foot 3 inch bloke built like a rugby player.\u201d\nDr Helen Fidler, the deputy chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) UK consultants committee, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s lives are absolutely being put at risk because of ill-fitting PPE. We know that properly fitted PPE works, but masks are designed for a male template, with the irony being that 75% of workers in the NHS are female.\u201d\nCaroline Criado-Perez, whose book Invisible Women addresses the issue of ill-fitting PPE for women in one of its chapters, said she has been inundated with messages from healthcare workers who could not find protective equipment to fit them.\n\u201cRespiratory protective equipment is designed for a male face, and if it doesn\u2019t fit it won\u2019t protect,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of a dearth of sex disaggregated data we don\u2019t know how many women are affected, but I am hearing on a daily basis from women in the NHS who say they can\u2019t get their masks to fit.\u201d\nOne intensive care nurse revealed that half the women on her unit had failed the fit test \u2013 a rigorous process which ensures health workers wear the right size mask, which does not leak \u2013 on both of the FFP3 masks available. \u201cThe only men I know of that have failed are either very small, or ones that refuse to shave their beards so don\u2019t get a tight fit. Sexism is very much present here,\u201d she said.\nAnother experienced critical care nurse had to be redeployed to work with less ill patients because her \u201chead was too small for the mask to create the right seal around her mouth\u201d. Collecting sex disaggregated data on the result of fit tests was vital to addressing the problem, Criado-Perez said.\nAsked about the lack of PPE for women, the minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, said \u201cpeople need the same level of protection\u201d, which Criado-Perez argues is currently impossible.\n\u201cPeople are dying and we should all be furious about that, it is an international scandal,\u201d she said.\nKnowledge of the lack of properly fitting PPE for women is not new. A 2016 survey conducted by the trade union Prospect, the TUC, and others found that just 29% of female respondents were using PPE designed for women, and 57% said their PPE hampered their work.\nFrances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said frontline workers were being forced to risk their lives because they lacked proper PPE. \u201cWith women making up nearly eight in 10 of the NHS workforce, it\u2019s a disgrace we don\u2019t have protective uniforms in women\u2019s sizes. Our workers deserve better,\u201d she said.\nFemale nurses were routinely expected to work without adequate PPE or to use PPE that had not been produced to meet the required safety standards, said Rose Gallagher, the professional lead for infection prevention and control at the Royal College of Nursing.\n\u201cNurses can find it very difficult to deliver care to patients if this equipment is so uncomfortable it bruises the skin and makes them feel hot and unwell,\u201d she said.\nFiddler, also a consultant gastroenterologist at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS trust, said one colleague in intensive care had developed ulcers on her face after pulling a mask as tight as possible to protect herself. However, she said, there was still an unwillingness among female health workers to complain.\n\u201cIt is seen as somehow just something you have to put up with, but is really not acceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken a global pandemic for people to realise that women are a different shape than men. The government has a moral, legal and ethical responsibility to sort this out, and quickly.\u201d",

        "content": "The race director of the London Marathon has refused to rule out staging the event as an elite-only race in the autumn if social distancing rules make it impossible to run as normal.\nHugh Brasher told the Guardian that while organisers still hoped to hold the event with 45,000 mass participants on 4 October, they were now scenario-planning around 10 other options because of the global pandemic.\n\u201cThe flame is still burning,\u201d said Brasher. \u201cAnd is there hope? Absolutely. But you have to do what\u2019s right for society. You usually have 750,000 people out in central London watching 45,000 runners. Then there\u2019s the medics, the 6,000 volunteers and the transport system. There\u2019s masses to take into account when making any decision.\u201d\nWhen asked directly whether the London Marathon \u2013 which was due to take place this Sunday before being pushed back \u2013 might have to be only for elite athletes if social restrictions had not eased completely, Brasher replied: \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know. But in today\u2019s society, you can never say never. We are trying to stay really agile and to keep scenario planning. And at the moment, I don\u2019t want to discount anything until it becomes really impossible.\u201d\n  Last month\u2019s Tokyo marathon was staged as an elite-only race, with the field reduced to just 300 runners and the streets largely deserted. Most major spring marathons subsequently decided to postpone their races to the autumn \u2013 but those events also look in doubt with no vaccine in sight and, ominously, the Berlin marathon has already cancelled its race in September.\n\u201cOur decision will be made by the back end of August at the latest,\u201d explained Brasher. \u201cIt will be based on the government guidelines, and what we and society think is right and what feels right.\u201d\nBrasher would not confirm whether Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, who were due to meet on Sunday in a clash for the ages, had signed up for October\u2019s revised race. However he told the Guardian: \u201cWe always want to get the most competitive race. This was going to be the 40th London marathon, and its greatest race. It was going to be spectacular. But we want to make October 4 spectacular too. So that\u2019s what our focus is.\u201d\nLast year the London Marathon raised \u00a366.4m for charities, again making it the biggest single-day fundraising event in Britain. And while Sunday\u2019s race will not take place, organisers are still hoping that thousands of people will spend the day raising and donating money for charities as part of a nationwide 2.6 Challenge \u2013 in which people tackle something related to the numbers two and six.\nMore than \u00a31.5m has already been raised for the campaign, and Brasher said he hoped it would prove a lifeline for many charities which usually rely heavily on the race to fund their work.\n\u201cThe London Marathon is normally about so many scripts and so many stories,\u201d said Brasher. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest athletes in the world with the everyday athlete \u2013 who are doing this incredible challenge with the gods of the sport such as Kipchoge, Bekele and Brigid Kosgei, on the same day, on the same course, with the same crowd. In fact, the everyday person gets more people watching them. That\u2019s the incredible thing. And, of course, they are raising so much money for charity too.\u201d\n\u201cSadly it\u2019s estimated charities will lose \u00a34bn in income as a result of the pandemic. But they are needed more than ever \u2013 and they will be needed more than ever as we come out the other side. That\u2019s why we came up with the idea of the 2.6 Challenge, because charities are such an intrinsic part of society and they need our help.\n\u201cThe response has been fantastic,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we really hope that Sunday and beyond will show how much we care as a society for all the charities that exist across the UK that underpin a huge part of what makes Britain great.\u201d",

        "content": "A startup is recycling tonnes of discarded fishing nets throughout Chile. Is this a template for tackling the global plastic waste problem? \nIn Tumbes, a village in southern Chile, discarded plastic fishing nets are crammed into gaps between parked cars and market stalls, evidence of a global waste problem that the town is working to resolve.\nUntil recently, most discarded fishing nets in this coastal fishing village were dumped straight into the sea \u2013 contributing to the massive plastic pollution crisis that\u2019s choking the planet\u2019s oceans.\n\u201cIf you have a broken net, you throw it anywhere you can,\u201d says Ramon Maldonado, a fisherman in Tumbes.\nBut a startup called Bureo \u2013 founded by three North American surfers \u2013 is collaborating with fishermen like Maldonado to keep hundreds of tonnes of discarded nets out of the ocean each year.\nNets are sorted, cleaned, and cut in Bureo\u2019s warehouse in Concepci\u00f3n, a city a few miles from Tumbes. Here they are turned into 100% recycled polyester and nylon pellets, called NetPlus, which are sold to companies as a sustainable alternative to first-use plastics.\nToday NetPlus is used in Patagonia\u2019s hat brims, Trek bike parts, Humanscale office chairs \u2013 and even sustainable Jenga sets.\nBureo joins dozens of initiatives addressing an urgent environmental question: how do we tackle our ocean plastic problem? And can we do it without reducing plastic use?\nWhile it is challenging to gauge exactly how much plastic has accumulated in the world\u2019s oceans, an estimated 8m tonnes of new plastic pollution enters oceans every year. The oil industry is investing in a huge surge of plastic production, which is expected to grow by 40% by 2030. Studies have also shown the proliferation of single-use plastic is accelerating climate change through greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its lifecycle.\nIf current trends continue, by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\nNorthern Point, Girlfriend Collective and Rothy\u2019s are all budding companies producing clothing entirely from ocean plastics. Larger brands such as Nike, Adidas and Fjallraven have also launched garments from recycled ocean plastic.\nThe plastics industry has long pushed recycling as the solution to pollution. In reality, less than 10% of the plastic produced in the US each year is recycled. This is in part because it is hard to make recycling initiatives profitable, as Bureo learned firsthand when they tried to produce sustainable skateboards in 2013.\n\u201cOcean plastic is not one type of plastic that can be used for high-value products, it is mixed and degraded and needs to be separated,\u201d says David Stover, who founded Bureo alongside Ben Kneppers and Kevin Ahearn.\nDurable products need to be made from quality substances. Wading through masses of ocean trash and sourcing key material is time-consuming and financially draining.\nThe company met with scientists and coastal communities in Chile to vet different materials. They found that rather than smaller plastics such as bottles and six-pack rings, coastal communities were particularly burdened by fishing nets piling up on beaches.\nNets account for 10% of the ocean\u2019s plastics, according to a United Nations report. Heavy and cumbersome, they choke land mammals and pollute sea beds and beaches. And fishermen in Chile were desperate to get rid of them.\n\u201cIt was a burden and they had no solution for it,\u201d says Kneppers.\nKneppers spent two years living in Chilean coastal villages, working directly with fishermen to flesh out how to collect and process the nets. Bureo compensates artisanal fishermen for their collaboration, while industrial vessels can earn environmental certifications by participating.\nCurbing global plastic production, however, may prove the bigger challenge, especially given a likely surge in cheap new plastics resulting from falling oil prices.\n\u201cReplacing virgin plastics in the market with recycled materials is important to get to a circular economy,\u201d says Luisa Santiago, who leads Latin American operations at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The ultimate goal, she stresses, must come from solutions that eradicate waste production, rather than rely on it. \u201cWe can\u2019t recycle our way out of the problem.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Bureo is making a dent in Chile\u2019s net waste problem. The Concepci\u00f3n facility processes 800 tonnes of nets annually, clocking 2m lb of recycled raw plastic to date. They reached profitability in 2019.\nThe team has scaled production, launching sites in Peru and Argentina. They have also entered an agreement with Chile\u2019s National Commercial Fishing Industry Association, and are on track to recycle 100% of the country\u2019s wild-caught net waste.\nAll Patagonia\u2019s hat brims now use Netplus, accounting for 60 tonnes of recycled material. Matt Dwyer, who leads Patagonia\u2019s materials innovation and development team, says the hats are just the beginning.\n\u201cWe have to provide whatever economic incentive we can for these materials to get recycled into high-quality durable goods, like a jacket you\u2019re going to wear for 25 or 30 years,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about proving it can be done.\u201d\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

        "content": "Proposal follows slow take-up of bank lending by companies during Covid-19 crisis\nThe Treasury is considering introducing 100% government-backed rescue loans for Britain\u2019s smallest companies after the slow take-up of bank lending by businesses during the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is believed to be close to making a decision about adapting the current scheme, which has come under criticism in the last week from business lobby groups, former chancellors and the governor of the Bank of England.\nThousands of businesses have complained that the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS), which is run by the British Business Bank, is cumbersome and includes financial hurdles that many businesses are unable to overcome. Currently, the government underwrites 80% of the value of the loan but is now giving serious consideration to raising that to 100%, in a development first reported by the Financial Times.\nThe Institute of Directors has joined the CBI in calling for 100% state-backed loans to circumvent onerous commercial bank lending rules, saying this would unlock a system that is currently expanding at a slow crawl.\nThe former chancellors George Osborne, Norman Lamont and Sajid Javid and the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, have called on Sunak to move to 100% government-backed business loans.\nThe Treasury has already had to change its criteria to get money out more quickly to businesses that may otherwise fail to survive the lockdown. It has banned personal guarantees that put business owners\u2019 property at risk, and scrapped a controversial requirement for banks to offer loans at commercial interest rates \u2013 reportedly as high as 12% \u2013 to any eligible businesses before offering a CBILS application.\nThe latest weekly data released on Thursday by the banking lobby group UK Finance showed that lending under CBILS had reached 16,624 companies, which accounts for just 40% of the 36,000 formal applications lodged with banks so far. However, the amount of lending to small and medium-sized businesses under CBILS has more than doubled to \u00a32.8bn over the past week.\nWhile approvals have increased from a rate of 21% a week earlier, critics are still concerned that banks are not able to get money fast enough to businesses that need it most.\nGermany and Switzerland have pushed out tens of thousands more loans to businesses after putting in place standard forms and common criteria for high street banks to follow. France has agreed \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.5bn) of loans, which have a 90% state guarantee, to more than 170,000 businesses and expects to process a further \u20ac20bn by the end of the month.\nHowever, senior banking executives have played down the likely impact of the government giving 100% backing CBILS loans, claiming it would make no difference in the pace of approvals.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have the impact that people think,\u201d one senior banker told the Guardian. \u201cThe agreement with the government is very clear: we have to do our appropriate due diligence and ascertain that the business was a viable business pre-Covid.\u201d\nUK regulations also require small business customers to undergo affordability checks so banks do not saddle them with an unaffordable amount of debt. Sources said those extra checks have \u201cput off\u201d some banks from offering loans worth less than \u00a325,000.\n\u201cSo even if the government said [they would back the loans] 100%, the banks shouldn\u2019t really be acting massively differently. I don\u2019t think it would be good behaviour.\u201d\nAn executive at another major high street bank said the discussions about higher guarantees were a \u201cdistraction\u201d in a wider debate about whether governments should be handing money directly to businesses.\n\u201cAn alternative would be a grant scheme where customers end up self-declaring their financial position through an application,\u201d the banking executive said. In that scenario, banks would serve as a processing hub for government cash.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very different scenario which would be quicker for a borrower to access but clearly there are big implications in terms of what risk does the public sector and taxpayer take in this type of market,\u201d the executive said.\n\u201cIf you want it to be quicker, faster, more straight forward, you therefore need to move away from the banks undertaking those credit checks,\u201d he added.\nUnited States\nWashington\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program is almost a hybrid of the UK\u2019s CBILS and furlough schemes, providing forgivable loans that are meant to support worker pay.\nThe PPP offers small businesses with less than 500 employees loans to cover staff wages for eight weeks, though a smaller portion can be used for mortgage interest payments, rent and utility costs, even if the companies remain shuttered. If all the criteria are met, the loans \u2013 which otherwise come at an interest rate of 1% \u2013 do not have to be repaid.\nThe PPP was originally allocated $349bn (\u00a3305bn) but was increased by $320bn after the initial funding ran out out within two weeks of the scheme opening. More than 1.6m firms had loans approved.\nFrance\nFrance has so far agreed \u20ac20bn (\u00a317.5bn) of loans to more than 170,000 businesses. It expects to process a further \u20ac20bn by the end of the month.\nIn total, the government is backing up to \u20ac300bn of bank loans, with state guarantees ranging from 70-90%, depending on the size of the business.\nThe loans are available to all firms, regardless of size, and are usually worth up to three months of the company\u2019s revenues in 2019 and do not have to be repaid for up to 12 months.\nLike the UK, business are also being supported though a deferred tax payment arrangements and the government is also providing state subsidies for worker wages through employers during the lockdown.\nThe French government has said it is willing to nationalise French companies if necessary.\nGermany\nBusinesses have been able to apply for loans of up to \u20ac1bn, which are 80% and 100% guaranteed by the state depending on the size of the firm.\nThe loans, which come with interest rates as low as 1%, are available to struggling companies that were viable before the Covid-19 outbreak. Depending on their size and creditworthiness, companies can access up to \u20ac1bn in emergency funding.\nWhile the process was working well for small businesses borrowing up to \u20ac3m, reports suggested there were initial difficulties in getting some loans out to larger firms. However, those hiccups seem to have been temporary.\nAuthorities have also had to deal with fraudsters trying to exploit the generous programme, which has forced some German states such as North Rhine-Westphalia to temporarily suspend payouts.\nThe total number of state-backed loans now approved in Germany \u2013 including between startups, medium-sized businesses and large companies \u2013 has reached 17,906 with \u20ac10.3bn (\u00a39bn) granted to date, according to the German economic ministry. About 18,170 business have applied for emergency financing to date.",

To change the date, Congress has to intervene.\nTrump has not announced plans to delay the 3 November election, but it is a concern both political parties have raised. The president has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding about the limits on executive power, particularly when it comes to his own self-preservation.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has also increased concerns about how to conduct in-person voting safely. In response, many are pushing for an expansion of voting by mail.\nTrump has used Covid-19 press briefings to make false claims about voting by mail, calling it \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d. Earlier this month, Trump also urged Republicans to fight efforts to expand voting by mail.\n\u201cRepublicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDemocrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans.\u201d\nAt the fundraiser, Biden also referenced reporting by the Washington Post which revealed Trump\u2019s reluctance to fund the US postal service and efforts to force changes to its financial structure, which could harm voting by mail.\n\u201cImagine threatening not to fund the post office. Now, what in God\u2019s name is that about? Other than trying to let the word out that he\u2019s going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.\u201d\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has already reshaped the 2020 campaign. The candidates are campaigning from home and at a stage in the cycle when the election tends to dominate news coverage, reporters are instead focused on Covid-19.\nBiden also shared a broader concern about interference in the presidential election by Russia and two unnamed \u201cmajor actors\u201d.\n\u201cI promise you the Russians did interfere in our [2016] election and I guarantee you they are doing it again with two other major actors,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou can be assured between [Trump] and the Russians there is going to be an attempt to interfere.\u201d\nIn response to Biden\u2019s comments, the Trump campaign said in a statement: \u201cThose are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality. Perhaps he also missed the news that the infamous Steele Dossier, central to the Russian Collusion Hoax, was likely compiled with Russian disinformation. That\u2019s the real Russian collusion.\u201d",

        "content": "Belgium appears hardest hit on paper, but not all countries count non-hospital fatalities\nEvery day, the statistics bring more grim headlines: \u201cItalian death toll passes 20,000\u201d, \u201cRecord UK daily death toll\u201d, \u201cEurope\u2019s fatalities pass 100,000\u201d. Across the world, people await national updates on the coronavirus \u2013 and compare their country with others.\nThe comparison game has been especially marked in Belgium, which on paper has the unhappy title of highest number of Covid-19 deaths per capita in Europe. Belgium \u2013 population 11.5 million \u2013 has counted at least 6,675 deaths since the start of the outbreak, more than Germany, which is nearly eight times more populous.\nBut such comparisons can be misleading. Unlike the UK, Italy or Spain, Belgium counts all coronavirus deaths outside hospitals in its daily statistics: deaths in care homes account for 53% of the total. Belgium\u2019s official toll also includes people suspected of having died of coronavirus, without a confirmed diagnosis. Nearly all deaths in care homes (94%) are suspected Covid-19 cases, rather than confirmed \u2013 an approach that has led some to complain Belgium is overestimating the number of fatalities.\nMarc Van Ranst, a Belgian virologist, told the Flemish national broadcaster that the official methodology was \u201cdumb\u201d, while some ministers have voiced concern in private. \u201cNobody would benefit from reporting people as Covid deaths if they are ordinary deaths from old age,\u201d a federal government source told Flemish daily De Tijd last week.\nBelgian officials have defended the approach, arguing it is more precise and saves lives, as information has prompted policy changes, such as mass testing in care homes. \u201cMore and more countries are beginning to copy the Belgian model,\u201d Prof Emmanuel Andr\u00e9, the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 crisis spokesman, told journalists this week.\nThe Netherlands has recorded at least 4,050 deaths from coronavirus, 24 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 55 per 100,000 in neighbouring Belgium. But a Dutch health ministry spokesman said the Netherlands figure was \u201can underestimation\u201d because it only included deaths where coronavirus had been confirmed. Between 6 and 12 April, 5,036 people died in the Netherlands, compared with an average of 2,857 in the same week in the three previous years, a number of excess deaths that helps give an idea of the scale of undercounting.\nThe UK has reported that at least 18,738 people have died in hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus. This headline figure, which is given in the government\u2019s daily briefing, also does not tell the full story. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show Covid-19 fatalities in care homes in England and Wales more than quadrupled in a week, rising to 1,043, while coronavirus deaths at home more than tripled in the same period to 466.\nIn France, the care home number is 7,896, which represents 40% of the country\u2019s overall coronavirus deaths. The figure is almost certainly higher. France\u2019s health authority has been giving care home death figures since 3 April, when they were only \u201cpartial\u201d. Now they are said to be more or less complete figures.\nFrance has more than 10,600 public and private care homes and they are a long ignored part of the health system. Covid-19 has revealed a lack of equipment and material, including masks and testing. But it has also shown the overwhelming dedication of carers, who are largely underpaid, and under recognised for their work.\nOne of the worst cases is in Mougins, near Grasse on the French Riviera, where 37 of 109 residents of a private care home have died of Covid-19, and 14 of 50 staff tested positive when testing was finally done.\nIn Spain, the official number of coronavirus deaths is about 20,000. But it could be much higher if deaths in care homes are taken into account, according to the regional governments of Madrid and Catalonia, the areas hardest hit by the pandemic. Collating data from care homes and funeral directors, they say that in the two regions respectively about 4,275 and 3,000 care home residents have died from the virus.\nThe Spanish health ministry did not request care home data until 8 April and several of the country\u2019s 17 autonomous regions have yet to provide it. Last Friday the ministry said it would continue to base its statistics on deaths of people who had been tested for the virus, thus excluding until now most care home deaths.\nIn most of central Europe, coronavirus numbers are still much lower than in countries further west, but there is concern here too that care homes are vulnerable and could quickly lead to rising numbers. Hungary\u2019s far-right government and the liberal mayor of Budapest have been locked in a blame game over one care home in the city which has recorded 223 residents and 19 workers as being infected, about 10% of the country\u2019s total coronavirus cases.\nNeighbouring Slovakia has some of the lowest numbers in Europe, and until last week, just two people had died from the virus. However, seven people have since died after an outbreak in a nursing home in the town of Pezinok, and the government has promised to embark on widespread testing in homes across the country.\nVariations in counting of Covid-19 deaths, different testing strategies and lockdown policies make international comparisons a minefield. \u201cA comparison between [EU] member states is difficult and should be done with extreme caution,\u201d said a spokesperson at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the EU agency to tackle infectious diseases.\nThe agency is urging governments to count everyone who dies of coronavirus, irrespective of whether they die in hospital, a care home or private residence, as well as recording deaths where Covid-19 was \u201cthe main or contributing cause\u201d.\nData for France, Spain and central Europe was collected on 21 April; data for the Netherlands, the UK and ECDC statistics on 23 April, and for Belgium on 24 April.\n This article was amended on 27 April 2020. The data was collected on various dates in April, as above, not during March as a previous version said. This has been corrected.",

He has been recuperating at Chequers after being released from hospital on 12 April.\nThe health secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Johnson was \u201con the mend in a big way\u201d but that his return to work was a matter for the doctors. Hancock described Johnson as \u201cebullient\u201d while recovering at his country retreat, where he is said not to be doing official work.\nThe prime minister is said to have told aides to start scheduling catch-up meetings with individual cabinet ministers next week as he retakes the reins of the UK\u2019s coronavirus response, and he may chair the cabinet meeting himself.\nRaab, who is also foreign secretary, has been deputising for Johnson since he fell ill. This has involved him leading cabinet meetings as well as taking prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday.\nAccording to the Telegraph, Johnson has spent the past week increasing his workload in anticipation of his return and has spoken to Raab on a daily basis.\nHe is said to have been studying government papers and closely following parliamentary proceedings. The phone call with Trump involved a discussion on a UK-US trade deal.\nHow the UK will leave the lockdown and the way that will be communicated to the public will be among of his most pressing issues.\nTrump told reporters in the US: \u201cHe was ready to go. I am very surprised to tell you this. It\u2019s like the old Boris. Tremendous energy, tremendous drive. He called me pretty close to when he got out the hospital. I think he\u2019s doing great. He\u2019s so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of ours, a friend of mine.\u201d\nJohnson told the public about his coronavirus diagnosis on 27 March and that he would isolate in his flat at No 11 Downing Street for a week.\nAfter seven days, No 10 said he would not be returning to frontline work as his temperature had persisted. On 5 April he was admitted to St Thomas\u2019 hospital, where he was placed in intensive care on 7 April and treated with oxygen. He was released five days later.",

        "content": "Exclusive: Scientists examine whether this route enables infections at longer distances\nCoronavirus has been detected on particles of air pollution by scientists investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected.\nThe work is preliminary and it is not yet known if the virus remains viable on pollution particles and in sufficient quantity to cause disease.\nThe Italian scientists used standard techniques to collect outdoor air pollution samples at one urban and one industrial site in Bergamo province and identified a gene highly specific to Covid-19 in multiple samples. The detection was confirmed by blind testing at an independent laboratory.\nLeonardo Setti at the University of Bologna in Italy, who led the work, said it was important to investigate if the virus could be carried more widely by air pollution.\n\u201cI am a scientist and I am worried when I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we know, we can find a solution. But if we don\u2019t know, we can only suffer the consequences.\u201d\nTwo other research groups have suggested air pollution particles could help coronavirus travel further in the air.\nA statistical analysis by Setti\u2019s team suggests higher levels of particle pollution could explain higher rates of infection in parts of northern Italy before a lockdown was imposed, an idea supported by another preliminary analysis. The region is one of the most polluted in Europe.\nNeither of the studies by Setti\u2019s team have been peer-reviewed and therefore have not been endorsed by independent scientists. But experts agree their proposal is plausible and requires investigation.\nPrevious studies have shown that air pollution particles do harbour microbes and that pollution is likely to have carried the viruses causing bird flu, measles and foot-and-mouth disease over considerable distances.\nThe potential role of air pollution particles is linked to the broader question of how the coronavirus is transmitted. Large virus-laden droplets from infected people\u2019s coughs and sneezes fall to the ground within a metre or two. But much smaller droplets, less than 5 microns in diameter, can remain in the air for minutes to hours and travel further.\nExperts are not sure whether these tiny airborne droplets can cause coronavirus infections, though they know the 2003 Sars coronavirus was spread in the air and that the new virus can remain viable for hours in tiny droplets.\nBut researchers say the importance of potential airborne transmission, and the possible boosting role of pollution particles, mean it must not be ruled out without evidence.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u00a0a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nPeter Beaumont,\u00a0Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\nProf Jonathan Reid at Bristol University in the UK is researching airborne transmission of coronavirus. \u201cIt is perhaps not surprising that while suspended in air, the small droplets could combine with background urban particles and be carried around.\u201d\nHe said the virus had been detected in tiny droplets collected indoors in China.\nSetti said tiny droplets between 0.1 and 1 micron may travel further when coalesced with pollution particles up to 10 microns than on their own. This is because the combined particle is larger and less dense than the droplet and can remain buoyed by the air for longer.\n\u201cThe pollution particle is like a micro-airplane and the passengers are the droplets,\u201d said Sett. Reid is more cautious: \u201cI think the very small change in the size of the [combined] particles is unlikely to play much of a role.\u201d\nProf Frank Kelly at Imperial College London said the idea of pollution particles carrying the virus further afield was an interesting one. \u201cIt is possible, but I would like to see this work repeated by two or three groups.\u201d\nAnother expert, Prof John Sodeau at University College Cork, in the Republic of Ireland, said: \u201cThe work seems plausible. But that is the bottom line at the moment, and plausible [particle] interactions are not always biologically viable and may have no effect in the atmosphere.\u201d He said the normal course of scientific research might take two or three years to confirm such findings.\nOther research has indicated correlations between increased Covid-19 deaths and higher levels of air pollution before the pandemic. Long-term exposure to dirty air is known to damage lung health, which could make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.\n Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

        "content": "Jonathon James is previously unidentified individual who reached millions with false claims about Covid-19\nA recording spread around the world at the end of March, purportedly featuring a former Vodafone executive claiming to let the public in on a secret that the coronavirus pandemic is cover for a global plot to install 5G mobile phone masts, track the world\u2019s population through vaccines, and then destroy human society as we know it.\nIn reality, the Guardian can reveal, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor from Luton who recently tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy.\nJonathon James, who regularly preached at churches in Bedfordshire, is the previously unidentified individual who reached millions of people with his detailed but nonsense claims that Covid-19 is a fake disease covering for the impact of 5G.\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with biological warfare but is our bodies reacting to radiofrequency radiation,\u201d he told listeners to the 38-minute recording, claiming the real cause of global deaths was new mobile technology causing cell poisoning. \u201cThey are using coronavirus to try to hide the fact that people are dying from the 5G frequency.\u201d\nAlthough James was not the first individual to attempt to connect the pandemic and 5G, the popularity of his recording grew at the end of last month, just as people believing the conspiracy theory began to burn down phone equipment and harass telecoms engineers.\nIn the recording he suggests that Bill Gates is involved in a plot to produce coronavirus vaccinations that will contain computer chips to track individuals, a move he claims will ultimately herald the destruction of society.\n\u201cThe coronavirus is not what\u2019s killing people, it is clearly, categorically, unequivocally proven that the radio frequencies we are being exposed to are killing the people,\u201d he told his audience without any evidence. \u201cGod has blessed me with the ability to bring disparate pieces of information together that puts the puzzle together and makes sense of it.\u201d\nAlthough many copies of the recording have been deleted by YouTube for breaching its policy on dangerous disinformation, new uploads continue to be available. Delivered in the form of a sermon, it has also racked up millions of views across other networks and continues to circulate on WhatsApp. But until now the originator\u2019s identity has been unknown.\nMuch of the audio clip\u2019s claims to credibility rely on James\u2019s assertion that he is the former head of the largest business unit at Vodafone, supposedly giving him the inside track on new technologies at one of the world\u2019s biggest telecoms companies.\nVodafone insiders told the Guardian that while James had worked for the company, he was hired for a sales position in 2014 at a time when 5G was not a priority for the company and was unlikely to be in his remit. They said he ultimately left Vodafone after less than a year.\nDespite this, many of the leading online anti-5G groups repeatedly refer to the supposed censoring of a \u201cformer Vodafone boss\u201d as a key source backing up their beliefs, with the recording spreading out of the UK and reaching large audiences in the US and Nigeria.\nInternational radiation watchdogs have cleared 5G as safe, while NHS bosses have called on people to stop spreading rumours linking the pandemic to 5G and threatening vital infrastructure.\nJames\u2019s identity was ultimately pieced together by researchers at the fact-checking startup Logically, working in conjunction with the Guardian. When the preacher was contacted he said he \u201cwas absolutely shocked that [a] somewhat \u2018private message\u2019 to a dedicated small community went viral and [was] ubiquitously covered [on] various social media platforms\u201d.\nThe preacher, whose WhatsApp profile picture shows him relaxing on a private jet wearing a monogrammed shirt, said: \u201cFor the record, I certainly wasn\u2019t trying to vilify, incriminate or implicate any mobile network operator for their commercial endeavours to roll out their unified telecoms and next generation of mobile topologies in this regard.\n\u201cHad I known my voice note would have gone to a wider audience I certainly would have contextualised my thoughts, been more specific on what I was sharing citing references, and far less explicit. I was simply trying to summarise what the \u2018perceived truth\u2019 was behind this bizarre pandemic in the interest of serving my community.\u201d\nJames, who regularly preaches at the Light City Christian Ministries in Luton, has apparently had a varied career since his time at Vodafone. He claims to have at one point advised central bankers in \u201cthe Congo\u201d and Bangladesh on cryptocurrencies and he has posed with the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa. In 2018 he was working as an economic adviser for a Zimbabwean opposition party, urging it to save the economy using Bitcoin-type products pegged to diamond deposits through blockchain technology.\nAsked if he had any final comment, James said he was unable to reply as he \u201chad some rather pressing head of state engagement necessitating my full attention and time [for the] last 48 hours\u201d.",

For more than 12 hours, the gunman evaded police, traveling across the province before he was shot dead outside a gas station.\nAs Canada reels from the worst mass shooting in its history, new details of the slaughter and its aftermath have emerged \u2013 raising fresh questions about the shooting and the response of the emergency services.\nAmong the revelations is the fact that for nearly seven hours, authorities did not realize the murderer was disguised as a police officer and driving a replica police cruiser.\nClinton Ellison and his brother, Corrie, were staying at their father\u2019s home in Portapique when they heard a single gunshot on Saturday evening.\nHeading outside to investigate, the brothers spotted a large fire up the road. Corrie walked ahead, but he soon called his brother and told him to contact the fire department.\nWhen Corrie failed to return home, Clinton followed his path towards the smoke and found his brother\u2019s body in the road.\n\u201cI shut my flashlight off, I turned around \u2013 and I ran for my life in the dark,\u201d Clinton told CBC News. Sprinting as fast as possible, Ellison turned up the driveway of a cottage.\n\u201cI turned around and looked towards the road I had just run from to see a little flashlight flashing around, looking for me,\u201d he said.\nRealizing the gunman was searching for him, Ellison ran blindly into the woods.\nFor nearly four hours he hid among the trees \u2013 praying for help amid bursts of gunfire and explosions from the fires \u2013 before officers led him to safety.\n\u201cTo walk up and find my brother dead, and to be hunted by this fella that killed all these people, I\u2019ll be traumatized for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.\nPolice have not yet identified the first victims, but a number of news outlets reported on Friday that it was his longtime girlfriend, who he assaulted and handcuffed following an argument.\nThe woman, who has not yet been identified, survived his attack and managed to escape, hiding in the woods for hours as gunshots rang out in the dark, before finally emerging and contacting police.\nIt was then that authorities received their most critical tip: the woman told authorities that their suspect in the shootings was dressed as a police officer and driving a replica police vehicle. She provided the RCMP a photograph of the car, kicking off the frantic, hours-long search across the province for Wortman.\nThe head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Brenda Lucki, has said that several of the victims were known to the gunman \u2013 but that he later simply opened fire at anyone in his path.\nLate on Saturday night, an officer in tactical equipment arrived at Nathan Staples\u2019 house to check on the Glenholme resident.\n\u201cHe came to apologize. He said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry we couldn\u2019t have been there quicker.\u2019 That\u2019s when I got angry,\u201d Staples told the Globe and Mail, uncertain why he was being visited by police.\nOn Friday, the RCMP said that a number of people had been approached by officers who they believed might have been in danger.\n\u201cWe were contacting individuals who we believed could have been on a list or were potentially at risk,\u201d RCMP superintendent Darren Campbell told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe were contacting them, we were bringing them to safety and we were interviewing them at that time.\u201d\nDuring the manhunt, two officers discharged their weapons at a fire station in the town of Lower Onslow, leaving a string of bullet holes in the facade.\nSeveral people were inside the building but the suspect was not known to be in the area at the time. The serious incident response team \u2013 an independent body that intervenes after police shootings \u2013 is investigating.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they were firing at,\u201d the SIRT director, Pat Curran, told the Toronto Star.\nNearly 12 hours after police received their first 911 call, the murder spree came to an end at a gas station outside the town of Enfield, more than 50 miles from where the first victims were found.\nJonathan Heffernan, a firefighter at the Halifax international airport, had pulled in to refill his truck. Thanks to the coronavirus lockdown, the station \u2013 usually bustling on a Sunday morning \u2013 was largely empty, but the quiet was soon punctured by an exchange of gunfire.\n\u201cI had no idea what was going on,\u201d Heffernan told the Guardian. \u201cA guy was running around the corner of the building. He yelled to me that someone was shooting. We both hid behind my truck. We still had no idea what was happening.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a firefighter for 14 years. Absolutely the most terrified I have ever been.\u201d\nThe two hid behind Heffernan\u2019s truck as heavily armed police swarmed the area and helicopters circled overhead. Ten minutes later, the two men were told they could safely come out of hiding.\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that Heffernan realised that he knew one of the victims: Tom Bagley, a volunteer firefighter whose generosity and unflinching kindness were praised by friends and colleagues.\n\u201cLearning that a former member of our fire family was also killed just added to the emotion,\u201d said Heffernan.\nThe maritime province has been deeply shaken by the killings. \u201cThere are just so many pieces left to pick up before people can even begin to start grieving,\u201d said Tiff Ward, a lifelong resident of the region who knew several of the victims.\nPolice believe Wortman acted alone \u2013 although they are investigating whether he was helped in obtaining firearms and the police uniform. The RCMP said Wortman did not appear to have a firearms licence.\nBecause the coronavirus pandemic has prevented mass gatherings, community members have a planned an online vigil for Friday evening, said Ward.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s dropped their work and they\u2019re bringing their very best self too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need this. We need a really big light to shine up into the biggest darkness imaginable.\u201d",

        "content": "Tony Blair Institute says carefully applied technology could be route through crisis\nA dramatic increase in technological surveillance is a \u201cprice worth paying\u201d to fight Covid-19, argues a report from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.\nGovernments and private companies can use location data to track the success of lockdown measures, monitor bluetooth signals to help contact tracing efforts, or keep an eye on search queries to help identify new clusters of infection or previously unknown symptoms.\nPrivacy activists have warned, however, that such extensions of surveillance could be a dangerous precedent that would be hard to roll back once the crisis is over.\nThe TBI argues in the report published on Friday that those fears are valid, but understate the degree of trade-off that many countries face.\n\u201cCarefully applied, technology gives policymakers a possible way through the crisis that reduces otherwise very high costs in terms of lives lost and livelihoods destroyed,\u201d said Chris Yiu, the institute\u2019s executive director of technology and public policy. \u201cBut this escape route comes with a price: dramatically increased technological surveillance. Under the right conditions, this is a price worth paying.\n\u201cIn normal times the degree of monitoring and state intervention we are talking about here would be out of the question in liberal democracies,\u201d Yiu continued. \u201cBut these are not normal times, and the alternatives are even more unpalatable. This is quite different from the traditional debate about whether confronting security threats to our way of life merits sacrificing the values of freedom and privacy that define us.\n\u201cCovid-19 is not an ideology, and rebalancing the contract between citizens and the state to take advantage of the capabilities of new technologies is not capitulation.\u201d\nAs a result, governments should consider a number of interventions that might normally cross the line, Yiu said. For instance, states could require technology platforms to share, in aggregate form, search and social media trends, and telemetry from wearables and other connected devices, to help them respond to the crisis. And they could share patient data internationally, to accelerate the search for treatments and vaccines, rather than putting up walls around national health services as they would in normal times.\nBut the brakes should not be removed entirely. The TBI argues strongly against \u201ccoercive\u201d linking of apps and services: for instance, requiring people to use a contact tracing programme in order to receive digital credentials proving they are key workers. \u201cIf it is necessary to deem participation in a scheme mandatory,\u201d the report argues, \u201cthis should be legislated for.\u201d\nOthers disagree, however. A joint letter from almost 300 academics working in computer science and privacy rejected the dichotomy the TBI proposed, arguing that technological surveillance would hamper, not help, efforts to fight the coronavirus by wrecking the public trust that is needed for uptake.\nThe academics wrote: \u201cIt is crucial that citizens trust the applications in order to produce sufficient uptake to make a difference in tackling the crisis. It is vital that, in coming out of the current crisis, we do not create a tool that enables large-scale data collection on the population, either now or at a later time. Thus, solutions which allow reconstructing invasive information about the population should be rejected without further discussion. Such information can include the \u2018social graph\u2019 of who someone has physically met over a period of time.\u201d\nThe TBI\u2019s intervention comes amid an uneasy alliance of technology companies and nation states. To aid digital contact tracing, for example, Apple and Google announced a plan to build privacy-protecting technologies into the base layer of their Android and iOS operating systems. But some countries, including France, have argued the privacy protections that the tech companies have mandated are preventing them from carrying out important work, like telling individual users specific details of their contact with an infected person.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking Apple to lift the technical hurdle to allow us to develop a sovereign European health solution that will be tied our health system,\u201d France\u2019s digital minister, C\u00e9dric O, said on Monday.",

I\u2019m not great at bingeing. I just can\u2019t sit there and watch five episodes of Better Call Saul. After two episodes, I\u2019m ready for a break. I just don\u2019t have the time on lockdown. I\u2019m constantly making dinners, tidying up and taking the dog for a walk. Who wants to binge when the weather\u2019s like this?\nWe usually watch a movie at the weekend, but now you\u2019ve put me on the spot, I can\u2019t remember what. Yes, you\u2019re right, Sliding Doors was on the other day, but \u2013 ha \u2013 I\u2019ve seen that. I can\u2019t wait for the third series of Succession. It\u2019s King Lear, isn\u2019t it?

I liked what his wife said about how the British are obsessed with quizzes. I\u2019ve often thought that it\u2019s like why we\u2019re so obsessed with crime dramas. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t have guns. If you go round shooting everybody, you\u2019re easy to catch. Without guns, the elaboration of the crime mystery is a lot more engaging. It\u2019s all done with a candlestick in the library or getting shoved off a train. If we had guns, we\u2019d make westerns and shoot-out films. But instead we have Agatha Christie and Poirot and Miss Marple.\nI\u2019m also in this new Canadian TV show called Transplant. Hopefully it\u2019ll be shown over here.

It\u2019s so \u2018dad on TikTok\u2019.\u201d\nBut Starmer is right to worry about being well lit. \u201cIt makes it look professional,\u201d says Powner. Something that is perhaps particularly important for politicians: \u201cFor people like Keir Starmer, they are talking to us about life or death policies,\u201d says Roz Morris, the managing director of media training company TV News London and a former BBC and ITV broadcaster. \u201cHe\u2019s a serious person and he wants to look like one.\u201d\nThe right location can also help with lighting, as the director of Channel 4\u2019s The Steph Show, which is being filmed at presenter Steph McGovern\u2019s home, explains. \u201cWe got very lucky with the living room as it has a lot of natural light,\u201d says John Adams. \u201cWe use simple panel lights to just help lift levels on Steph\u2019s face.\u201d\nFor those outside the public eye, the long arms of Zoom and Skype are forcing many to think about their video appearance. There are lessons that Starmer \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 could learn from the stars of TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. So-called selfie ring lights have been big business. \u201cA small ring light will help to lift the complexion and bring radiance to counteract any shadows that may appear,\u201d says Hayley Hall, a beauty influencer who has a YouTube channel and more than 27,000 Instagram followers. She uses the Selvim selfie ring (\u00a327.99). \u201cIf you are concerned about remaining professional and looking your best then the light essentially lifts the shadows that can make you look tired.\u201d\nWith professional life shifting further online, \u201cthis is a whole new world of skills people are having to take on and lighting is vitally important,\u201d says Morris, who has seen a recent uptick in demand for her services \u2013 a webinar she is running next week has 800 registered guests rather than the usual 300.\n\u201cAs people had to learn to use computers, now they have to learn to use online image,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have made the mistake of thinking this is just a kind of visual phone call but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a professional encounter in which they have to be like a producer and director.\u201d",

        "content": "Looser regime means Sweden is better placed to face second wave, says chief epidemiologist\nSweden questioned the scientific basis of other EU countries\u2019 strict coronavirus lockdowns as Germany said its number of cases needed to fall from about 2,000 to a few hundred a day before it could ease restrictions further.\nAs several European countries continued to cautiously lift lockdowns, sending children back to school and reopening some shops and businesses, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said their original measures looked difficult to justify.\nSweden has favoured civic responsibility over mandatory rules, closing senior high schools and banning gatherings of more than 50 people, but asking rather than ordering people to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or feeling ill. Shops, restaurants and junior schools have stayed open.\nPolls show many Swedes support the policy, although the interior minister, Mikael Damberg, and the mayor of Stockholm, Anna K\u00f6nig Jerlmyr, urged people not to relax as the weather turned warmer, warning that bars and restaurants that did not follow physical distancing recommendations risked being shut down.\nThe strategy has also been heavily criticised by some senior members of the country\u2019s scientific community and the country has recorded 2,150 deaths \u2013 giving it a per-million total much lower than Italy\u2019s and Spain\u2019s, but many times higher than those of its Nordic neighbours.\nTegnell said in an interview with Nature magazine that it was \u201cdifficult to talk about the scientific basis of a strategy with these types of disease, because we do not know much about it and we are learning as we are doing, day by day\u201d.\nThe epidemiologist added: \u201cLockdowns, closing of border \u2026 Nothing has a historical scientific basis, in my view. We have looked at a number of EU countries to see whether they published any analysis of the effects of these measures before they started, and we saw almost none.\u201d\nHe told the BBC Sweden\u2019s strategy meant it was better placed to face a second wave of the outbreak, because scientists estimated between 15% and 20% of the population were now immune \u2013 enough to slow and control the spread of the disease further.\nThe strategy had worked in the sense that its aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so the country\u2019s healthcare system did not become overwhelmed, he said. Sweden\u2019s relatively high death toll was because \u201cas many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly, which have banned visitors\u201d so it was \u201chard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that\u201d.\nIn Germany, Lars Schaade, the vice-president of the country\u2019s infectious diseases agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said citizens \u201cshould not lower our guard now\u201d, echoing an earlier warning by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, that the country risked rushing out of lockdown and squandering its achievements so far.\nGermany, which last week allowed smaller stores, car and bicycle dealers and bookstores to reopen provided they observed strict distancing and hygiene rules, has recorded 150,383 cases and a relatively low death toll of 5,321.\nBut Schaade said he was opposed to any further relaxation until the number of new daily infections fell. \u201cIt is a paradox that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very same measures are now being called into question,\u201d he said. \u201cMore contact will mean more infections \u2026 which, in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.\u201d\nMeanwhile, media in Italy \u2013 whose 25,000 coronavirus deaths represent the second biggest tally in the world after the US \u2013 said the government was set to gradually begin easing Europe\u2019s longest and toughest lockdown, in place since 9 March, over the course of the next four weeks.\n\u201cThe next four Mondays will mark the country\u2019s reopening,\u201d the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. The country\u2019s economy would emerge from lockdown at intervals from 27 April, it said, beginning with some factories, followed by clothing and other shops and concluding on 18 May with bars and restaurants.\nThe economy\u2019s gradual reopening would be accompanied by strict hygiene and physical distancing measures, the paper said, with only one customer at a time allowed in shops smaller than 40 sq metres and bars and restaurants obliged to keep a distance of one metre between clients. There was no official confirmation.\nSpain, which has Europe\u2019s second highest death tally with more than 22,500 fatalities, hailed the fact that for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, more people were now being diagnosed as cured than those falling sick.\n\u201cWith all the effort that we have put in, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the health ministry\u2019s emergency centre coordinator. Officials from the country\u2019s 17 regions and central government were to meet later on Friday to discuss easing its six-week lockdown.\nIn France, where schools and shops are due to begin reopening from 11 May, the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Friday no decision would be taken on bars and restaurants before the end of next month. \u201cNothing would be worse than to make a hasty reopening which would then force us to close again,\u201d Le Maire said.\nThe Czech Republic unexpectedly opened its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine.\nFace masks will remain mandatory until the end of June, but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather compared with a previous limit of two. Restaurants and pubs can fully reopen on 25 May, two weeks earlier than initially planned.\nIn further developments:\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said China might have known of the coronavirus as early as November.\nSouth Korea reported just six more cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.\nAustria said it would start to reopen school classes from 4 May in a staggered return for pupils lasting until the end of the month.\nGerman business morale fell in April to its lowest level since reunification.\nMedical experts have widely condemned Donald Trump\u2019s musings about whether disinfectant and UV rays could be used on people to fight the virus.\nRussia reported nearly 6,000 new cases and 60 more deaths in 24 hours, scotching hopes it was reaching a plateau.",

The fire has been nipping at Bolsonaro\u2019s heels for a couple of months now \u2026 and congress has always hated Bolsonaro. So if that 30% starts to budge, things could move really quickly.\u201d\nWithin seconds of Moro\u2019s announcement there were already signs support for Bolsonaro was slipping with deafening pot-banging protests erupting in major Brazilian cities, including in strongly pro-Bolsonaro areas of Rio de Janeiro.\n\u201cFora Bolsonaro! Fora Bolsonaro!\u201d (\u201cBolsonaro out!\u201d), dissenters cried from their windows and balconies as they pounded their saucepans.\nA commentary in the conservative O Antagonista website said: \u201cIf he has any honour, Bolsonaro should resign. If he doesn\u2019t resign, impeachment proceedings should begin. In any case, the government is finished.\u201d\nThe immediate trigger for Moro\u2019s resignation was reportedly Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to remove one of the minister\u2019s closest associates, Maur\u00edcio Valeixo, from his job as head of the federal police.\nSince reports of Valeixo\u2019s impending firing emerged on Thursday, Brazilian newspapers have filled with speculation about why Bolsonaro would be so keen to remove him.\nA report in one major newspaper, the Correio Braziliense, claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s discomfort stemmed from the fact that a federal police investigation into the dissemination of fake news and promotion of anti-democracy protests was closing in on a highly sensitive target: the president\u2019s own son, Carlos Bolsonaro.\nCarlos Bolsonaro denied those claims in a pair of offensive tweets aimed at the broadsheet.\n\u201cYou scum never stop lying,\u201d one said. Another read: \u201cYourarse [sic].\u201d\nIn his explosive 40-minute resignation speech, Moro claimed he was leaving government because of what he called Bolsonaro\u2019s unacceptable and inappropriate political interference in Brazil\u2019s federal police.\nMoro claimed Bolsonaro had told him he wanted a federal police director he knew and could call up in order to have access to police intelligence reports.\nBut Winter, who knows Moro and had questioned his decision to enter politics, claimed other factors had also played a role \u2013 including Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-scientific handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cHe has been deeply frustrated by a number of things including the government\u2019s response to Covid-19,\u201d Winter said, claiming Moro had been part of a group of ministers \u201cconstantly lobbying Bolsonaro to take the pandemic more seriously and adopt a science-based response\u201d.\nWinter said Moro, who last year resisted calls to resign after leaked documents prompted claims he had improperly plotted to jail Lula, also sensed political pressure on Bolsonaro was growing and that the coming months would represent \u201can existential threat for the presidency itself\u201d.\nMoro, who rejected the allegations against him as \u201csensationalist\u201d smears, is the second top minister to leave Bolsonaro\u2019s administration in just over a week.\nLast Thursday, Bolsonaro fired his popular health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after he publicly challenged the president\u2019s coronavirus response.\nBolsonaro continues to play down the crisis and undermine social distancing measures despite Covid-19 now having claimed more than 3,300 lives. On Thursday a record 407 deaths were reported.\nSpeaking before Moro\u2019s resignation, the author and commentator Pedro Doria said he feared there would be a high human price to pay for the political chaos consuming Brazil.\n\u201cEvery single person in government should be totally focused on Covid-19,\u201d Doria said.\n\u201cThe only real result of all this is that a lot of people will die.\u201d",

Seven of the 10 local government signatories to the letter are in countries that have not volunteered to take in children under a relocation effort launched by the European commission in March.\nRutger Groot Wassink, Amsterdam\u2019s deputy mayor for social affairs, said it was disappointing the Dutch government had declined to join the EU relocation scheme. He believes Dutch cities could house 500 children, with \u201c30-35, maybe 40 children\u201d being brought to Amsterdam\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we can send a plane in and pick them up, because you need the permission of the national government. But we feel we are putting pressure on our national government, which has been reluctant to move on this issue,\u201d he said.\nThe Dutch government \u2013 a four-party liberal-centre-right coalition \u2013 has so far declined to join the EU relocation effort, despite requests by Groot Wassink, who is a member of the Green party.\n\u201cIt might have something to do with the political situation in the Netherlands, where there is a huge debate on refugees and migrants and the national government doesn\u2019t want to be seen as refugee-friendly. From the perspective of some of the parties they feel that they do enough. They say they are helping Greece and of course there is help for Greece.\u201d\nIf the Dutch government lifted its opposition, Groot Wassink said transfers could happen fairly quickly, despite coronavirus restrictions. \u201cIf there is a will it can be done even pretty soon,\u201d he said.\nTen EU countries \u2013 Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg and Lithuania \u2013 have pledged to take in at least 1,600 lone children from the Greek islands, just under a third of the 5,500 unaccompanied minors estimated to be in Greece.\nSo far, only a small number have been relocated: 12 to Luxembourg and 47 to Germany.\nThe municipal intervention chimes with comments from the German Social Democrat MEP Brigit Sippel, who said earlier this month that she knew of \u201ccities and German L\u00e4nder who are ready \u2026 tomorrow, to do more\u201d. The MEP said Germany\u2019s federal government was moving too slowly and described the initial transfer of 47 children as \u201cridiculous\u201d.\nAmsterdam, with Utrecht, organised the initiative through the Eurocities network, which brings together more than 140 of the continent\u2019s largest municipalities, including 20 UK cities. The UK\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel, has refused calls to take in lone children from the Greek islands.\nGroot Wassink said solidarity went beyond the EU\u2019s borders. He said: \u201cYou [the UK] are still part of Europe.\u201d",

        "content": "CMA vows to tackle concerns and says it will not hesitate to take action over breaches\nThe UK\u2019s competition watchdog will next week set out measures to tackle concerns about refunds and cancellations in the travel industry after a surge in complaints.\nOn Friday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in the week ending 19 April, four in five complaints received by its coronavirus taskforce related to refunds and cancellations.\nThe government-backed body said it was \u201cparticularly concerned\u201d about firms refusing refunds, charging high administration or cancellation fees and pressuring consumers into accepting vouchers instead of cash refunds.\nMy flight to Europe is cancelled. All I\u2019m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers. Is this legal?\nNo. But that hasn\u2019t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU\u2019s \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.\nThe problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.\nRefunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.\nNote: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU \u2013 for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.\nIn the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do?\nTaking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.\u00a0\nCoby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott\u00a0and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:\nI understand that my flight [fight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. You are reminded that the refund must be made within seven days. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.\nIf the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use Alternative Dispute Resolution.\nIf your flight cost more than \u00a3100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable. When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route.\u00a0\nMy flight operated as scheduled but I was unable to go on it. What then?\nThe fact that the government advised against all but essential travel means travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims provided you bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March.\u00a0\nMiles Brignall\n\u201cThe taskforce is looking closely at these practices \u2013 with a focus on sectors and individual businesses that have been the subject of a high volume of complaints \u2013 and next steps will be announced next week,\u201d the CMA said.\n\u201cThe CMA will not hesitate to take enforcement action if there is evidence that businesses have breached competition or consumer protection law.\u201d\nThe proposed action comes after the consumer group Which? claimed that 20 of the UK\u2019s largest airline operators were illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within 14 days.\nWhich? also found that 10 of the UK\u2019s biggest travel companies, including Love Holidays and Tui, were not offering full refunds within the legal time limit.\nThe CMA taskforce has received 21,000 complaints about coronavirus-related issues since its launch last month. It has sent advisory or warning letters to 187 firms after receiving 2,500 complaints about large price rises on food and personal hygiene products, such as hand sanitiser.\nThe largest price increases complained about related to hand sanitiser, with a reported median rise of 367%. The average increase across all complaints about price hikes \u2013 which related to rice, eggs flour, toilet paper and paracetamol \u2013 was 130%.\nThe CMA said it had written to trade bodies representing convenience stores and the online trading sites Amazon and eBay in its attempt to tackle price rises.\nIt said it was \u201ccontinuing to engage\u201d with eBay and Amazon to ensure listings that charge unjustifiable prices for essential goods were removed quickly.\n This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version said that four in five of 21,000 complaints received by the CMA coronavirus taskforce related to refunds and cancellations. In fact the four in five figure relates to complaints received just in the week ending 19 April.",

        "content": "Marbella\u2019s former Real Madrid player founded an artificial intelligence company for football but has a model for this crisis\nEsteban Granero has some good news, a little light at the end of a long, dark tunnel in Spain, where the coronavirus crisis has left more than 21,000 people dead. \u201cThe situation is terrible,\u201d says the midfielder, a league title winner with Real Madrid, \u201cbut the curve is clearly downward now; we reached the peak on the fourth [of April] and now we\u2019re on the way down. Things shift daily but we think at the end of the month, early May, the number of cases will be very low and there will be room for optimism.\u201d\nGranero does not speak lightly. He has been watching the trends carefully. Not just watching them, in fact: he has been helping to map, measure and predict the number of those infected in Spain. The former Queens Park Rangers, Madrid and Real Sociedad midfielder, who has just moved from Espanyol to the Second Division B side Marbella on a mission to take them to primera, is the founder and chief executive of Olocip, an artificial intelligence company engaged in the fight against the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a model that estimates and predicts the number of cases and tracks the evolution of those numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cThat allows us to anticipate potential problems in the mobilisation of resources. It predicts, for example, which regions will need masks and respirators, enabling you to anticipate supply. The model can also simulate distancing measures, measuring how changes in the lockdown impact upon the curve, foreseeing trends and helping us prevent a second wave.\u201d\nAll of which might sound like an unexpected activity for a footballer, but it started with the game. The advances that Granero and his team spent years working on are being applied to the pandemic, their findings available to health authorities. \u201cThroughout my career, I saw the information gathered, how it was analysed and used, and it was pretty deficient,\u201d he says. \u201cSome decisions were taken in an arbitrary way, and I thought there had to be a means of producing analyses that was not just descriptive but predictive.\u201d\nGranero, who began studying psychology at Complutense University in Madrid, contacted Pedro Larra\u00f1aga and Concha Bielza five years ago. Professors of AI at the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica and \u201ctwo of the most important scientists in Europe\u201d according to Granero, they and he worked with a network of data analysts, doctors and scientists to fine-tune their models.\n\u201cThe principal error in descriptive analysis is that it doesn\u2019t respond to the question the club is actually asking,\u201d Granero says. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a player to sign, I\u2019m not so interested in what he did last year as asking: \u2018Look, if I sign this player, how will he work here, in my context?\u2019 And that answer can only be provided by artificial intelligence.\n\u201cPeople tend to think of AI as a kind of magic; it\u2019s not, it\u2019s analysis. It\u2019s not a rejection of intuitive, \u2018inside\u2019 football knowledge, either. Or machine over man. Quite the opposite. You need intuition, understanding, to even identify the variables to be measured. The role of the expert is primordial, defining the analysis you need.\n\u201cFor example, you might ask: \u2018How can we get this player in this area of the pitch and generate a chance in fewer than three passes?\u2019 You can measure that, analyse it, and generate statistics on a descriptive level but also measure that as a predictive variable, enabling you to identify players who can perform that role. Applying the data in a predictive manner is the big leap.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call football mechanised but everything you do is susceptible to being converted into data, although there are intangibles, chance. What we do is build the tools that strengthen an expert\u2019s ability: a sporting director, say, or a doctor preventing injuries. In the same way a mathematician uses a calculator, we provide the tool that facilitates the process. We always say that human and machine working together are much stronger than either on their own.\n\u201cUncertainty can never be zero. These are models of probability, not deterministic. It\u2019s not a crystal ball. What it can tell you scientifically is that there is a certain type of player in the third division in Holland, say, that if you sign him there\u2019s a 95% chance he will score between 12 and 15 goals.\u201d\nAsked how often the model is right, Granero replies: \u201cThe normal thing is for it to get it right. Lots, lots, lots of players finish with the numbers predicted. At most you\u2019re talking one or two off. The prediction models are tested, validated, held against reality. It\u2019s not an easy process: some time ago these models didn\u2019t exist and we have worked at this, getting it right. When you see it works, the results are powerful. With so much in play and with these tools now available to help you take decisions better, bloody hell, it\u2019s your responsibility to do so.\u201d\nThere is far more in play now and the responsibility is greater. \u201cI got a call from a friend of mine who had created a platform called Stop Corona, asking if we wanted to help predict the evolution of the virus,\u201d Granero says. \u201cWe thought we had the tools to help and that it was our responsibility to contribute. We\u2019re providing the model free; there are lives at stake.\n\u201cThe official numbers can confuse things. When there\u2019s such an evident shortfall in the number of tests, when there are so many people who have caught it without it being tested, you know that\u2019s not the real number. It\u2019s a diagnostic reality, not a true measure of the people with the virus. The real number can be estimated by a model like ours.\n\u201cWe started when the state of alarm was announced. The model suggested something we now know: that if had it been declared sooner, the curve could have lower, smaller and recovery would have happened sooner. That\u2019s happened in countries all over the world, not just Spain. But some countries anticipated, using AI. Canada watched, predicted the impact of the epidemic and moved ahead of it.\n\u201cEqually you can project backwards, and if measures had been adopted two weeks later the dimension of the catastrophe would have been unimaginable. The exponential growth would have been prolonged, contagion on a scale that doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\n\u201cOur people are experts in their field, prestigious scientists, and we\u2019re not playing around with this. The data we provide is not law: it\u2019s analysed and interpreted by doctors, epidemiologists, mathematicians. We can\u2019t take decisions; what we can do is ensure the model is absolutely reliable to help doctors, nurses, medical staff on the frontline, putting themselves at risk every day. They\u2019re the heroes; the least we can do is put ourselves at their disposal, give what we can.\u201d",

Many others were seriously injured, he said.\nThere was no immediate confirmation from the Virunga park of the incident or casualties.\nThe park has been repeatedly hit by violence. It was shut to tourists for eight months in 2018 after a series of attacks on staff but reopened after a thorough review of security precautions and reinforcement of the 700 rangers deployed to keep animals and visitors safe.\nThe park, in North Kivu province, has a reputation as one of the most dangerous conservation projects in the world. It faces multiple security threats including illegal charcoal production, smuggling and poaching, as well as from the Mai Mai militia.\nFounded in 1925 by Belgian colonial authorities, the park struggled in the immediate aftermath of the country\u2019s independence in 1960 but flourished under President Mobutu Sese Seko, who took power in 1965.\nThe park suffered further during the civil war that followed Mobutu\u2019s chaotic fall in 1997. Virunga\u2019s mountain gorilla population declined to 300. It has since risen to more than 1,000, and the numbers of other animals such as forest elephants are also rising.\nIn 2007 a partnership was established between charities funded by private donors, the EU and the Congolese wildlife service. Emmanuel De Merode took charge and implemented a wide-ranging overhaul.\nThe rangers, who are recruited from nearby villages, are paid a monthly salary of $250, a sizeable sum for them. Initiatives have focused on nearby communities, with micro-loans and hydroelectric power projects to boost the local economy.\nAll visits to Virunga were suspended last month to protect the gorillas from infection by the coronavirus.",

Later that day, Murray tweeted: \u201cToday Jeremy Corbyn went to his local mosque for Visit My Mosque Day, and was attacked by a Brexiteer. Rachel Riley tweets that Corbyn deserves to be violently attacked because he is a Nazi. This woman is as dangerous as she is stupid. Nobody should engage with her. Ever.\u201d\nRiley has described Murray\u2019s tweet as an \u201cappalling distortion of the truth\u201d and is now suing for damages. She says Murray\u2019s tweet contained \u201cdefamatory statements of fact\u201d about her. In her defence, Murray argued that the tweet was not defamatory and was a statement of her opinion.\nOn Friday, following a preliminary hearing conducted by written submissions, Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that the meaning of Murray\u2019s tweet was that Riley \u201chad publicly stated in a tweet that he [Mr Corbyn] deserved to be violently attacked\u201d.\nThe judge also ruled that the part of Murray\u2019s tweet which said Riley was \u201cas dangerous as she is stupid\u201d was an expression of opinion, which meant that Riley had \u201cshown herself to be a dangerous and stupid person who risked inciting unlawful violence\u201d.\nNicklin said both of those parts of Murray\u2019s tweet are defamatory in common law. He rejected the contention, advanced by Murray\u2019s lawyers, that a reasonable reader of her tweet would understand the reference to Riley supposedly stating that Corbyn \u201cdeserved to be violently attacked\u201d to be an expression of opinion.\nConcluding, Mr Justice Nicklin said: \u201cAn imputation that a person had publicly supported a violent attack on someone is plainly defamatory at common law. It is conduct which would substantially affect, in an adverse manner, the attitude of other people towards the claimant or have a tendency so to do.\u201d",

        "content": "Economists predict bigger fall in April after panic-buying prevents larger March slump\nUK retail sales in recorded their largest fall on record in March as consumers were forced to restrict their shopping trips under the government lockdown.\nAmid concerns the economy could experience its biggest contraction in several centuries, the fall in retail sales of 5.1% compared with the previous month exceeded the already downbeat expectations of City analysts, who forecast a 4% slide for March.\nOnly panic-buying of food and freezers before the lockdown and household goods purchased bought online prevented a bigger slump, leading to predictions of a fall of up to 30% in April when the full impact of the government\u2019s restriction measures will be felt.\nThe Office for National Statistics said store closures had hit sales of furniture and home furnishings and especially clothing, which dived by 35% month on month. Petrol sales declined by 19% month on month.\nThe latest blow to high street sales came after a torrid 12 months in which many chains have gone to the wall and others shut stores in towns across the country.\nBefore the lockdown, retailers\u2019 profit margins had been hit by a combination of competition, rising business rates and escalating rents. Brexit uncertainty, which dampened consumer confidence, had also hit sales of \u201cbig ticket items\u201d such as cars.\nLast month the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced a raft of measures to protect businesses from the worst of the Covid-19 fallout, including a business rates holiday. On Friday, the government banned commercial landlords from \u201caggressive rent collection\u201d. This should help many retailers that have fallen behind with payments over recent months.\nBut the measures are not expected to prevent a further decline in the number of businesses on the high street after the lockdown is lifted. Shoppers, who have become used to shopping online, may continue to maintain deliveries of food and other items instead of visiting bricks and mortar shops.\nRevealing a strong divergence in sales, food, household goods and other non-food items all increased sales by value on the month by 15.3%, 18% and 16.4% respectively, the ONS said.\nSupermarkets reported a strong increase in volume sales, at 10.3%, while off-licence sales of alcohol soared 31.4% in volume terms. Online sales jumped to more than 22% of all sales, compared with an average of 18% over the last year.\nDepartment store sales rose by 2.8% month on month, though the increase appeared to be due to purchases of food and other items online.\nThe ONS said: \u201cComments from food store retailers suggested that panic-buying, or stockpiling during the coronavirus pandemic, was a big factor in the increased sales, particularly for supermarkets.\u201d\nThe ONS also confirmed that April was likely to bring even bigger falls. It said retailers responded to its survey between 1 March and 4 April 2020, meaning that two weeks of the five-week trading period were under physical distancing measures introduced before the lockdown.\nThomas Pugh, an economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith widespread lockdowns only beginning around the middle of March, retail spending looks like it will fall by much more in April, perhaps around 20-30% month on month.\n\u201cClearly there is huge uncertainty as to how deep the downturn proves and how long restrictions remain in place, a fall in the region of 25% in GDP over the next few months seems likely.\u201d\n\ufeffIan Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said that while a rush to remote working fuelled sales of home office equipment, and consumers bought home gym equipment, the situation was dire for many retailers.\n\u201cThe combination of a UK-wide lockdown, closure of many physical stores, and consumer confidence at a historic low, has posed a significant challenge to all retailers, albeit with differing consequences across retail sectors.\n\u201cThose trading in essential goods, particularly food, have seen sales increase by 3.9%, month-on-month, while the non-food category has seen the greatest decline as lockdown measures pressed an indefinite pause on the UK high street.\u201d",

It is misleading to link to the 2018 Guardian article \u201cNHS trusts win legal fight over Virgin Care child health contract\u201d, as Virgin Care had no part in, and had no choice over, the action the NHS trusts took, other than placing a bid for a contract offered by a public authority under procurement legislation.\nVirgin Group has invested more than \u00a375m to date into the NHS and neither Richard nor Virgin have ever taken a penny of profit out of the NHS, nor do they ever intend to do so. If Virgin Care ever does make a profit, we have committed to reinvest 100% of that back into the NHS.\nHyde also fails to paint an accurate picture of the tax affairs of the Virgin companies, all of which pay taxes in the countries in which they operate. That includes the brand-owning business, which is based, and pays taxes, in the UK.\nRichard spends the vast majority of his time starting not-for-profit ventures and raising millions for charity through speeches and other charitable engagements. Since he gives 100% of any monies he earns from these activities to charity, it makes no difference for his personal tax purposes whether he is located in the UK or the British Virgin Islands.\nWe were also saddened to see Hyde suggest that, if she were religious, she might think the fire on Necker Island and Hurricane Irma were some sort of punishment from God for Sir Richard Branson. Hurricane Irma devastated the BVI and further afield, and Sir Richard worked tirelessly to support the community and implement long-term projects to rebuild the region in the immediate aftermath. To use the hurricane in this context is a disservice to all those deeply affected by that natural disaster.Nicholas FoxVirgin Group\n Is Marina Hyde being a little harsh on Richard Branson? On a Virgin flight home from Los Angeles several years ago I answered the call for a doctor (the third call, actually, as hardened medics wait for somebody more gung-ho to respond) and saved the life of a businessman who had swooned during his in-flight massage (no, please, it was nothing).\nThe crew were so relieved when I spared them the expensive inconvenience of an unscheduled landing that they gave me a free orange juice as they ushered me past the empty business seats and back to steerage. It was followed up by a letter of gratitude and a promise of 10% off my next trip. I later found out that anybody could get 10% off by booking online.\nSo don\u2019t tell me Branson seems to feel entitled to the free benefit of others\u2019 generosity \u2013 I already know.Dr Richard O\u2019BrienHighbridge, Somerset\n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

Thankfully they have both recovered and returned to work this week.\nNow is the time for honesty, not reprehensible comments such as those of the health secretary regarding there being adequate PPE if used appropriately by staff. Firefighting the immediate problem is essential, but consideration of any form of phased exit from lockdown without a large stockpile of PPE would be criminal.\nThis country has a dynamic garment industry, and worldwide shortages cannot be blamed. The time required to assess the many companies that are coming forward with offers to help was mentioned at the ministerial briefing on Wednesday \u2013 it is far more urgent than that. Any company, not just those volunteering, that could adapt to the rapid manufacture of large quantities of PPE should be identified and their output requisitioned if necessary.\nBest practice regarding levels of protection should also be sought: a good place to start would be the Covid-19 hospital in Naples, where the use of effective PPE meant not a single member of the medical teams was infected at the height of the outbreak.Dr John O\u2019DriscollSale, Cheshire\n My mother was an Oldham cotton weaver, my father a cotton spinner. When I was growing up we often talked about the Great Depression. The mill Dad worked in teetered on the edge of closing, and often went on \u201cshort time\u201d (a two- or three-day week). My mother\u2019s place of work kept going. I asked Mum what she wove, and she replied \u201cstuff for hospitals\u201d. The hospitals got what they needed, and the weavers got the work and wages.

Let\u2019s get weaving!Fred BrookRedburn, Northumberland\n The government\u2019s response as to why it had not taken up the many reported offers from businesses to assist in the production of protective clothing was that it was concentrating on companies that could manufacture at scale. With its fondness for wartime metaphors, presumably this government would have told the soldiers at Dunkirk to ignore the small boat flotilla until a couple of big boats came along.John PatersonGlasgow\n Please can the government stop giving us macho but meaningless numbers regarding PPE that it is, or might be, acquiring: 70 million pieces of equipment means nothing.

Associated Newspapers denies the claims.\nAs the first round in her privacy claim was heard remotely before a virtual court hearing in London on Friday, she and Prince Harry were understood to be listening in from Los Angeles.\nMeghan is suing over five articles \u2013 two in the Mail on Sunday, and three on Mail Online \u2013 reproducing parts of the letters, with the headline on one reading: \u201cRevealed: The letter showing the true tragedy of Meghan\u2019s rift with a father she says has \u2018broken her heart into a million pieces\u2019.\u201d\nThe duchess has previously made clear that any damages over and above legal costs would be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\nAt a preliminary hearing, before Mr Justice Warby, lawyers for Associated Newspapers argued parts of the duchess\u2019s claim should be struck out, including that it had \u201cdishonestly\u201d cut out some words and sentences from the letter in order to paint a misleading picture of the relationship between father and daughter.\nAntony White QC for Associated Newspapers said allegations of \u201cdishonesty and malicious intent\u201d were not relevant in a misuse of private information case. \u201cThey are not relevant, they are not properly pleaded and should be pruned from the claimant\u2019s case.\u201d\nClaims by Meghan that the newspaper had \u201charassed, humiliated, manipulated and exploited\u201d her were \u201cremarkable\u201d given that she had not contacted her father to ask if he agreed, he added.\nDavid Sherborne, QC for the duchess, said: \u201cIt is the defendant\u2019s actions in stirring up, creating this dispute that they use as justification for publishing the contents of the letter.\u201d\nAssociated Newspapers is also seeking to strike out references to nine other articles, alleged by the duchess to demonstrate an agenda against her and part of her plea for aggravated damages. White said they were written by 14 different journalists, and were all said by Meghan \u201cto be false\u201d. He added these other articles were not sued on, and not written by the same journalist as the article sued on.\nDavid Sherborne, for the duchess, said it was a \u201ccomplete fallacy\u201d to dismiss claims that the newspaper had harassed and manipulated her father because she had not been in contact with him. Markle had \u201cmade it plain\u201d to his daughter in a letter complaining about his treatment by a journalist. It was also evident in highly damaging and distressing stories the publisher had run about Markle, including exposing him as a \u201croyal wedding scammer\u201d for having agreed to pose for fake photographs of his wedding preparations, the judge heard.\nThe Mail on Sunday was dishonest because while cherry-picking extracts to suit its negative narrative of the duchess, \u201cthey knew perfectly well it was not the whole letter yet they suggested it was the whole letter\u201d, the court heard.\nOn the other nine articles, on which she is claiming aggravated damages, Sherborne said it was all about the distress she felt at the realisation the defendant had an agenda of \u201cintrusive and offensive\u201d stories about her. The articles included: \u201cHarry\u2019s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: gang-scarred home of her mother revealed\u201d; \u201cKitchen supported by Meghan\u2019s cookbook is housed inside mosque \u2018which has links to 19 terror suspects including Jihadi John\u2019\u201d; and \u201cHow Meghan\u2019s favourite avocado snack \u2013 beloved of all millennials \u2013 is fuelling human rights abuses, drought and murder.\u201d\nCourt documents showed that Associated Newspapers wrote to Meghan\u2019s lawyers on 6 April, stating that Friday\u2019s hearing should be avoided if possible because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and offering not to seek costs if the disputed parts of her claim were withdrawn. However, it is claimed, her legal team replied saying she \u201cconsidered it was unreasonable to accept the offer\u201d.\nNo date has yet been set for the main trial. Her lawyers will argue that, contrary to the impression given in a series of articles, Meghan and Harry had repeatedly telephoned and messaged her father in the lead-up to the wedding, but he had refused to answer their calls.\nAssociated Newspapers will argue that the duchess had an expectation that the letter might be put in the public domain. An article in People magazine had quoted one of her friends making reference to it, it will argue.

Williams said: \u201cI think we are going to see a rise when we come out of lockdown.\u201d\nWilliams pledged an amnesty for domestic violence victims who may have breached lockdown rules saying the Met viewed stopping abuse as the priority: \u201cWe\u2019re interested in them as a victim of crime and holding the perpetrator to account.\u201d\nPolice were finding it easier to catch perpetrators as they were more likely be at home and less likely to be able to move around.\nIn one case in east London a woman called police but did not want to support a prosecution. Officers used their body-worn video to record a statement and that was enough to gain a \u201cvictimless\u201d prosecution.\nWilliams said there were two homicides in London linked to domestic violence but it was not yet known if either was linked to the lockdown.\nThe Met is working with other agencies and charities to find temporary housing for suspects so women and their children don\u2019t have to move home during the lockdown.\nWilliams said: \u201cIf we can arrest the perpetrator we give the victim some time to think about what they want to do.\u201d\nShe urged neighbours to listen out for heated arguments or screams and said victims could also send text messages to friends or family and they could call police for help.\nWilliams said: \u201cThe main thing we are seeing is what we call domestic incidents. It could be the parties themselves in the household, family, friends phoning us and telling us they\u2019re hearing noise, arguments taking place.\n\u201cOf course, there are violent offences; it has gone up a little bit but not massively. We have had two domestic-related murders in London during this period.\u201d",

        "content": "Police chief questions car guidance as data shows more people venturing out\nBoris Johnson is facing pressure to make a speedy return to work, as fresh data suggests the onset of lockdown fatigue, and as senior police officers argue over rules on movement.\nWarnings for the public to continue respecting lockdown rules were sounded at Friday\u2019s Downing Street briefing, where data showed that there had been an increase of between 2% and 3% in transport use over the past week.\nWhile driving and journeys on public transport have remained consistently low, data from Apple reflecting requests for directions also suggested that there had been an uptick over the past week in terms of people venturing out on foot in London.\nOn Wednesday, the government\u2019s own figures had shown that the UK\u2019s vehicle traffic levels this week were at their highest since the country\u2019s lockdown began.\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, added that the country had \u201cdone incredibly well\u201d but warned: \u201cThere is a danger as we go into another warm sunny weekend that people think that the peak is over \u2013 but it is not over. We are riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means established yet.\u201d\nThe deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said: \u201cOn the whole, as we have just seen, most of the public are really complying and really do support [social distancing]. That becomes increasingly difficult as we go through.\u201d\nThe data on transport use came as a senior police chief criticised national police guidance on exercise rules as hundreds of people in south-west England flouted lockdown restrictions to enjoy 20C sunshine.\nWhile updated guidance from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council stated that driving to the countryside and walking was considered a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for people to leave their homes in England, it was criticised by the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Shaun Sawyer, who said people should not drive to go exercising, dog walking or surfing.\n\u201cThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 guidance, which I think is some of the poorest guidance I have seen for a long time sadly, would allow people from outside the force [region] access to come in, the very thing that our communities don\u2019t want,\u201d he added.\nHis comments came as calls for the prime minister to return to the helm of government grew louder on Conservative backbenches.\nAndrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, said: \u201cThere are huge decisions that are going to have to be made in the near future and that can only be done by the prime minister. Boris can carry the public with him, he is the leader of the party with a huge election victory.\u201d\nBridgen said detail on easing lockdown restrictions for businesses and more information on when schools might go back would be top of Johnson\u2019s in-tray.\nAnother Tory backbencher said Johnson\u2019s absence had put significant strain on the government and lead to people taking the daily press conferences who did not have his skills.\n\u201cThere is a sense that people do want him back mainly because the people who have stepped in have maybe not performed as well as he could have done,\u201d they said.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of the press conference [of the business secretary] Alok Sharma took, and Priti Patel\u2019s [home secretary]. There is a sense it\u2019s much better to have one person that everybody knows as the focal point and that the people brought in on a daily basis have not been as good.\n\u201cWhat this has revealed is that the bench has not stepped up.\u201d\nMinisters had been discussing a sector-by-sector approach to lifting the lockdown in recent weeks. However, Whitehall sources say the expectation is now that the focus will be on the nature of the work being carried out: can it be done while maintaining physical distance, and how essential is it to the economy?\nThe \u201cquad\u201d of senior ministers \u2013 Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak \u2013 has also begun work on the preconditions that would have to be in place before workplaces could reopen, including increasing the frequency of transport services, and reopening schools.\nGovernment sources sought to play down divisions over what happens next. \u201cMost of the cabinet are in a pretty similar place: everybody wants the lockdown to end as soon as possible, but we have to do it at the right time,\u201d said one adviser.\nGreater Manchester police thanked the public following what the force said had been a significant reduction in calls to house parties. Officers were called to 432 reports of house parties last weekend, a 52% reduction on previous reports.\nBut there were hints of a potential unravelling of the lockdown in London, as the city headed into a warm weekend. On social media, Londoners reported seeing more traffic on the roads and more people using parks for more than just brief exercise.\nThe latest \u201cCovid\u201119 mobility trends\u201d data from Apple, which reflect daily requests for directions in Apple Maps, suggested that walking by Londoners was starting to tick up for the last three weekends compared with the first day of the lockdown.\nWeekdays in the last two weeks had also seen slightly more movement. Driving and public transport usage was consistently lower.\nMore reassuringly, recent data from Transport for London showed levels of movement on public transport in the capital this week were broadly as they were last week.\nOn the underground and buses, ridership was still down 95% and 85% respectively compared to the same time last year. A spokesperson for London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cSadiq has been absolutely clear that unless Londoners are making an essential journey, they should stay at home to save lives. The vast majority of Londoners have followed this advice.\u201d\nSpeculation over Johnson\u2019s imminent return to work grew after Donald Trump said he had sounded \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201cready to go\u201d in a phone call with him following his discharge from hospital.\nA report in the Daily Telegraph suggested Johnson, who has been recuperating at Chequers, could return to work on Monday. While Downing Street said the PM was yet to work on his \u201cred box\u201d of official papers as usual, his official spokesman said he was regularly receiving updates on the coronavirus response and had had calls with Raab, the foreign secretary, and Hancock, the health secretary.\nHowever another Tory told the Guardian the prime minister should not rush back to work as other ministers were coping.\nThey said: \u201cFor Boris there\u2019s no rush and the priority is that he has got to be fully ready. Matt Hancock has been a hero throughout this and worked tirelessly.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Alex Hern and Caelainn Barr",

On Friday her identical twin sister, Emma, died at the same hospital.\nTheir sister, Zoe, told the BBC: \u201cThey always said they had come into the world together and would go out together as well.\u201d\nZoe Davis said the \u201camazing\u201d pair, who lived together, had underlying health conditions and had been unwell for some time.\nKaty is the latest of more than 100 British health workers who have died from coronavirus.\nPaula Head, chief executive at University Hospital Southampton, said: \u201cKaty has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like, and that nursing was more than just a job to her. On behalf of everyone here at UHS, including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family.\u201d\nAmong some of the other recent victims is a former British National party member who found Islam and spent the last decade of his life as a respected social worker.\nMuhammad Islam, who grew up in the 1960s in Gateshead as John Ord, died on Thursday after contracting Covid-19. In 2005 he recounted to the Guardian how he had joined the BNP as a 16-year-old. He became a Muslim after stumbling on a copy of the Qur\u2019an in 1989. He changed his name and settled in Birmingham, married a primary school teacher from a Pakistani background, and started a degree in social work.\nSince 2010 he had worked for Birmingham Children\u2019s Trust, helping young people leaving care. Its chief executive, Andy Couldrick, said he died after suffering with Covid-19 for a few weeks. He said: \u201cMuhammad was a well respected, well liked and highly valued member of our care leavers team who supported many young people in Birmingham.\u201d\nRuth Allen, chief executive of the British Association of Social Workers, said: \u201cSocial workers continue to work tirelessly, knocking on doors, delivering vital services out in communities.\u201d\nThe death of an 88-year-old woman in south Wales highlights the lack of protection against the virus in hospices, according to her family.\nJohn Hunt suspects that his mother, Elsie Hunt, contracted the virus in a hospice before she died earlier this month in Singleton hospital, Swansea.\nHe said: \u201cAlready gravely ill, Covid-19 robbed her of being consoled by her family in her last days. In the hospice, no one wore masks. Even when Mum developed a classic dry cough and fever \u2013 and was moved to a single room \u2013 staff only wore simple paper masks, and no eye protection.\u201d\nHe said he could see his mother in her final days via FaceTime.",

Campbell said that an argument between the two might have been \u201cthe catalyst of events\u201d over the weekend.\nThe first victim found by police on Saturday night was a driver with a gunshot wound in the rural town of Portapique, set in thick forest. Fanning out across the crime scene, officers found several buildings on fire \u2013 and 13 other victims.\nAuthorities soon realized the suspected gunman owned several decommissioned police cruisers, but officers initially mistakenly believed all were accounted for. Two were found on fire at his house, and officers in Halifax located the third at another one of Wortman\u2019s properties.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t aware at that particular time and came, and became known to us later that he had a fourth vehicle,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cAnd that was the vehicle that he was using during his rampage.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until Wortman\u2019s girlfriend escaped into the woods and contacted police, that they learned of the fourth vehicle.\nThe police response was also hobbled by a mistaken belief that a single country road was the only way in and out of the first crime scene.\nIt was not until a second wave of emergency calls on Sunday morning that officers learned that the suspect had escaped and was more than 60km away, Campbell said.\n\u201cOur investigation has revealed that the gunman attended a residence on Hunter Road in the Glenholme area. At that location, the gunman killed two men and one woman and he set the residence on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least two of the victims were known to the gunman.\u201d\nWortman then went to another house, whose residents he knew. But as they saw him dressed as a police officer and brandishing weapons, they refused to answer the door, instead calling 911.\nWortman then continued down the highway, at this point using his replica police vehicle to pull over drivers.\n\u201cWitnesses described that the suspect had pulled over one of the vehicles and then shot one of the drivers,\u201d Campbell. \u201cHe continued driving down that same highway and he encountered his second vehicle and he shot and killed that victim.\u201d\nPolice also gave the first detailed account of the death of constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the RCMP.\nStevenson and a colleague, constable Chad Morrison, both hunting for Wortman, had agreed to meet at a highway intersection.\nWhen a white vehicle with police markings approached, Morrison thought it was Stevenson.\n\u201cThe approaching police vehicle was actually driven by the gunman, said Campbell. \u201cThe gunman pulled up beside constable Morrison and immediately opened fire,\u201d wounding Morrison.\nMorrison sped off, but Wortman then collided with Stevenson as she arrived at the scene in her cruiser. He shot her dead and stole her weapon and ammunition, before killing a passerby in a silver SUV.\nWortman then set Stevenson\u2019s patrol car and his own replica cruiser on fire, stealing the SUV from his latest victim.\nHe drove a short distance to the house of a woman he knew, fatally shooting her. He then changed out of his police uniform, placed his weapons in her vehicle, and went towards a nearby gas station in the town of Enfield.\nOfficers filling up an unmarked vehicle saw Wortman and drew their weapons.\n\u201cThere was an encounter and the gunman was shot and killed by police at 11.26 in the morning,\u201d said Campbell.\nPolice are still investigating how Wortman was able to obtain a number of firearms \u2013 a mix of pistols and long-barrelled guns.\nOnly one of weapons has been traced back to Canada. The rest are believed to have originated in the United States.",

        "content": "We run the rule over leading candidates, including a two-times World Cup winner and a woman who worked as Neville\u2019s No 2 \nThe Football Association\u2019s hunt for a successor to Mark Sampson in 2017 quickly became a circus. Names flew out of the ring as fast as they stepped in. Increased scrutiny on the person in charge, with the game professionalising, led some of those on the shortlist to withdraw. Others were poached from under the FA\u2019s nose. Hence Phil Neville moving to the front of the pack having not even been on the start line. The FA will be desperate to avoid a repeat. Ideally, it would like a woman to take the reins but it would be remiss to rule out some of the finest managers in the women\u2019s game on account of their gender. Who will be brave enough to take a job that looks a bit of a poisoned chalice?\nIt is believed the Manchester United manager has been the FA\u2019s ideal long-term candidate but with only one and a half seasons of management experience this could be too soon. A brief stint as Neville\u2019s No 2 and a lengthy international career mean the 37-year-old knows what is needed but the former centre-back has built a fine team from scratch in Manchester and it will likely be hard to prise her from the project. Last November she signed a new contract to 2022.\nA two-times World Cup winner with the US, the 53-year-old is a free agent. Reuniting her with former US high performance coach Dawn Scott, who rejoined the England setup after 10 years in the States, will surely be a tempting prospect for the FA. However Ellis comes with baggage. She won the 2015 and 2019 titles but survived a rumoured player revolt in 2017 and an attempt by the squad to get her fired before last year\u2019s World Cup in France. She was not popular with fans and all this may leave the FA wary. On leaving her position with the US Ellis said a move to English football would be tempting.\nThere are rumours that Hayes is not interested in the England job, unfinished business (a burning desire to win the Champions League) at Chelsea and a fractious relationship with the FA tempering any interest. However that does little to stop a clamouring for Hayes to be in the running. The 43-year-old is arguably the finest club manager in the Women\u2019s Super League and her drive to push women\u2019s football forward and leave a lasting legacy may yet persuade her to put aside her misgivings and step in.\nThe former Arsenal and Utah Royals manager is highly regarded in the US and England and was recently appointed by US Soccer as its Under-20 USWNT head coach. That could be enough to rule out the 39-year-old. Harvey, though, would be a popular choice among fans and players and would be a good appointment. Believed to be on the shortlist before Neville was handed the job, she instead swapped Seattle Reign for Utah.\nCushing has also only recently begun a job having left Manchester City Women to be assistant coach at New York City FC. He is likely not ready to return to women\u2019s football but the FA would be forgiven for having another go - it is believed that he was offered the job after Sampson\u2019s departure. Cushing has a reputation for bringing through young talent and several England youngsters \u2013 Lauren Hemp, Georgia Stanway, Ellie Roebuck and Keira Walsh \u2013 made their WSL breakthrough during his time at City.\nThere are plenty of other candidates worthy of consideration. The Portland Thorns manager Mark Parsons and North Carolina Courage head coach Paul Riley have been hugely successful in the NWSL in the US. The English duo have picked up NWSL manager of the season awards, with Parsons having won one NWSL Shield title (for finishing top of the table) and Riley three Shield titles and two NWSL Championship trophies (winning the post-season play-offs).\nThe Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson, who took over from Pia Sundhage after the 2017 Euros and led the team to a surprise third place in France, beating England in the third-place play-off, would be an alternative. The two-times Champions League winning French manager Reynald Pedros is a free agent after last summer\u2019s exit from Lyon.\nAn outsider from the NWSL could be the struggling Orlando Pride manager Marc Skinner. Although the victim of harsh criticism in the US, Skinner is highly thought of for his style of play and a team built on a shoestring at Birmingham.\nArsenal reportedly fought hard to stop Joe Montemurro interviewing for the USWNT team job when Ellis departed. Should the FA wish to make a similar approach they would likely be similarly rebuffed, although the Australian\u2019s pedigree may entice them to try.",

The left-back made six substitute appearances in the second half of the 2018-19 season but has exploded into life this campaign.\nIn February he mesmerised a world audience as Bayern took Chelsea apart and won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, prompting Lineker to tweet: \u201cAlphonso Davies\u2019 parents fled Liberia in the civil war. He was born in a refugee camp in Ghana and moved to Canada when he was five. Here he is playing beautifully for Bayern at 19. What a wonderful story.\u201d\nDavies, who extended his contract with Bayern this week, is widely liked for his amiable personality and refusal to take himself too seriously, as evidenced by his daft TikTok videos. Yet he is dedicated in his support of refugees, working closely with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) as a high-profile supporter. On Saturday, Davies will play three live-streamed matches in a Pro Evolution Soccer tournament against Milan\u2019s on-loan goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, a former refugee himself, to raise funds for UNHCR\u2019s Covid-19 response.\nSports presenter @GaryLineker meets the inspiring @FCBayern player @AlphonsoDavies, who is taking the football world by storm. \u26a1\u26bd pic.twitter.com/r5w8UOULJa\nGary Lineker Alphonso, it\u2019s lovely to sort of meet you, even though it\u2019s in these circumstances. First of all, how are you doing in isolation?\nAlphonso Davies Yeah, I\u2019m good. The team started training a couple of weeks ago so I\u2019m happy for that. But it\u2019s a tough situation right now, so I guess we just have to play our part and stay inside.\nLineker I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all get back to playing football once again. You have obviously had some hardships in your life, particularly growing up as a refugee. Do you remember your formative years in the Buduburam refugee camp?\nDavies I can\u2019t really remember too much about those years. I wish I could. I can\u2019t even really remember kicking a football around, although I know I did. It\u2019s not a memory they want to share with their kids too often, but they talked about it a little bit because it\u2019s part of our story.\nLineker Do you ever feel the urge to go back to Ghana or Liberia?\nDavies I asked my parents about it because we still have family in both countries but the way things are going right now I will have to wait a little bit longer.\nLineker Things have gone amazingly well for you since your family moved to Canada, but it must have been a massive step for them.\nDavies Yeah it was tough, but it was also an amazing feeling \u2013 being able to go to a country and do what you want to do, be who you want to be. I think my family did well. I\u2019m very proud of them.\nLineker And you finally had the chance to go to school, which should be an important part of any child\u2019s life.\nDavies Exactly. I enjoyed every moment of being at school. Football doesn\u2019t last for ever, so you need an education longer term.\nLineker When did you start to realise that you were quite good at this game?\nDavies [Laughs] Not until I moved to Vancouver in 2016 and joined the Whitecaps\u2019 academy team. Whenever I watched the first team, I thought: \u201cThis is where I want to be. This is my dream.\u201d I always did my best in training and on the field and now I\u2019m playing for one of the best teams in the world.\nLineker You were just 14 when you left home and moved to Vancouver. I heard that your mother was particularly worried that you might go astray and become a bad boy.\nDavies [Laughs] Yeah, that was her number one worry! She obviously wasn\u2019t there with me and so nobody was telling me what to do. But there\u2019s a policy at the Whitecaps where you have to maintain a grade average to be able to train and play in the academy, and if they see your grades are slipping up, they might even take you out of the academy. They took care of me.\nLineker Who did you support when you were younger?\nDavies My dad is a Chelsea fan.\nLineker Really? And look at what you just did to Chelsea!\nDavies Exactly! My dad really liked Didier Drogba and there was always a Chelsea game on when I was growing up. There were so many amazing teams to watch but I didn\u2019t particularly have a team. So it was Chelsea by force.\nLineker You were just 15 when you made your Major League Soccer debut for Whitecaps and, in 2017, after receiving Canadian citizenship, you became the youngest player to appear for the Canadian men\u2019s team. Then, in 2018, when you were 18, you were Canada\u2019s men\u2019s player of the year. You must have been incredibly proud.\nDavies It makes me feel like all the hard work I\u2019ve been doing over the years is really paying off. The coach saw something in me when I became a citizen of Canada and he took me to the national team camp\u2026 Being men\u2019s player of the year was a shock!\nLineker And, of course, in January 2019 you moved to Bayern Munich. How did that come about? I think a lot of European clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, were looking at you at the time.\nDavies There were rumours in the air that all these different clubs were looking at me but I didn\u2019t know which specific clubs. No one told me anything. And then I got a message: \u201cBayern Munich want to meet you.\u201d I was like: \u201cOh my god. Really?\u201d It was both exciting and scary. I just had to prove to myself that I could compete at this level.\nLineker What was it like on the first day? Was it intimidating meeting all the superstar Bayern players like Lewandowski and Neuer?\nDavies Yes! I\u2019d watched these guys on TV since I was a kid and there I was, seeing them in person, training with them and playing with them. I was very intimidated. When Arjen Robben introduced himself to me, I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\nLineker Do you think your previous experiences in life, as a refugee and then moving from Edmonton to Vancouver as a boy, helped ease your move to Germany?\nDavies I think so. Those moves definitely prepared me for moving overseas. If I hadn\u2019t already made those moves, I\u2019d be very homesick every single day. I am still homesick but I can deal with it.\nLineker We live in such challenging times. You are a supporter of UNHCR. Did you want to give something back perhaps?\nDavies I want to use my platform to talk about refugees and my personal story to inspire people to reach out and help. It\u2019s so hard for people in refugee camps to do any kind of social distancing. They need clean water, soap to wash their hands and food.\nLineker I\u2019ve seen some of your videos on TikTok and you\u2019re quite the personality on there aren\u2019t you? Singing, dancing, all sorts \u2026\nBayern Munich. Brooklyn 99. Backstreet Boys. In that order.@AlphonsoDavies is a man of many talents \ud83d\ude05 pic.twitter.com/ydOzLZC9g8\nDavies Football comes first, but I want to be an actor eventually.I like entertaining people and TikTok gives me the platform to do so. It allows fans to not only see what I do on the field, but also to get to know my personality a bit more. And it passes the time during the corona crisis when we are all staying home.\nTo contribute towards UNHCR\u2019s work with refugees during the Covid-19 pandemic, please click here",

        "content": "Emergency response body could have moved quicker at beginning of pandemic\nAs the coronavirus epidemic spilled out of China and seeded outbreaks around the world, the British government looked to its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for guidance on how best to handle the crisis.\nThe members of Sage are not a fixed group of wise academics that wait in their offices for the hotline to ring. The makeup of the group depends on the emergency at hand and is put together at the request of the Cabinet Office. At its best, it gives ministers direct access to the finest minds in the country as it navigates an unfolding emergency.\nSage comprises two dozen or so experts. Today, two-thirds are men. Some members are there to share advice from more specialised sub-groups. During the coronavirus pandemic they include the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, or SPI-M, made up of outbreak modellers from Imperial, Edinburgh and the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine among others.\nThen there are the behavioural scientists who feed into Sage via the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, or SPI-B. Another group that has a representative on Sage is the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, or Nervtag, home to the virologists and respiratory disease specialists who study the pathogens and their effects on the body.\nThe combined expertise, with senior medics, social scientists and outbreak specialists, is intended to ensure that all aspects of the unfolding pandemic, from the nature of the virus, to how people will react, are covered. Yet while Sage covers the academic bases, it is unclear whether it has the breadth of voices it needs. Could there have been more in the room, for example, who knew an emergency when they saw one?\nMore than a month ago, Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization\u2019s head of emergencies, made it abundantly clear that governments had to act fast to beat the virus. \u201cThe virus will always get you if you don\u2019t move quickly and you need to be prepared,\u201d he said. Speaking from experience with Ebola outbreaks, Ryan went on to add: \u201cAnyone who\u2019s involved in emergency response will know this.\u201d\nBritain did not move fast and was not prepared. As Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, one of the few members of Sage who is open about his membership, has warned, Britain could have Europe\u2019s worst death toll.\nIt is hard to look at the list and not feel it needs more mathematical modellers or more statisticians. Those disciplines are crucial for pulling in data and working out how the virus is spreading, who it is killing and in what numbers.\nThey are crucial too for cautiously predicting the future course of the disease, which in turn is needed to work out plausible exit strategies and give early warning of a second peak.\nBut what mattered at the start of the epidemic was to move fast, not wait until models revealed the spectacular death toll the country faced if sat on its hands.\nIt is not the only area where expertise appears to be lacking. Sage is not responsible for all of the government\u2019s advice: it goes to Cobra where ministers weigh it up against other considerations.\nBut beyond the clear failure to act fast, two areas that have defined Britain\u2019s ham-fisted response to the coronavirus pandemic are the inability to test at scale and devastating shortcomings in supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).\nWhere are the experts that could have organised companies to ramp up testing sooner, as is only now coming online? And who would have looked at the PPE stockpile and where the equipment had to go and seen a thorny problem that needed swift and decisive action?\nThe members of Sage are impressive individuals. But with the government insisting it is following the science, as if science offers only one route through this, the case for transparency has never been clearer.",

        "content": "The Dutch Eredivisie has become the first major European football league to cancel its season in response to the coronavirus crisis. For the first time since 1944-45, the Dutch top flight will not have a champion and there will be no relegation or promotion either from the 18-team division.\nA decision to end the season appeared inevitable after the Dutch government this week banned all sporting events until 1 September. The details of Friday\u2019s decision were determined by the league, its clubs and the Dutch FA (KNVB). They set a precedent that may be followed by other competitions in Europe and generated controversy in the Netherlands.\n\u201cUnder these circumstances it is not appropriate to speak of a championship and there is no champion,\u201d the Eredivisie said in a statement. \u201cBecause many rounds still have to be played in the competitions, we believe that we cannot apply promotion/relegation [either].\u201d\nEuropean places were granted to teams, however. This was based on the league table as it stood, a process in accordance with new Uefa guidelines.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/04/23-56544-gnl.fw.200423.jf.JonathanWilson.mp3\nThe league leaders Ajax have been granted a place in the final play-off round of the Champions League. Second-placed AZ Alkmaar will enter the second qualifying round of the same competition while Feyenoord, in third place, will enter the group stages of the Europa League. PSV Eindhoven (fourth) and Willem II (fifth) will enter qualifying for the Europa League.\nSome of the calls on European qualification are marginal. Ajax led AZ by goal difference with nine games to play, and Utrecht were three points behind Willem II with a game in hand and better goal difference. But the real controversy, which highlights the challenges of ending a suspended competition fairly, came with the suspension of promotion.\nAfter a vote was split on determining the best way to resolve promotion and relegation, the KNVB was given authority to make a determining decision. It ruled against any movement between the Eredivisie and the Eerste Divisie below, which meant that Cambuur, 11 points clear of third place in the second tier, were denied promotion.\nCambuur\u2019s head coach, Henk de Jong, said the decision \u201cfeels like the greatest disgrace ever in Dutch sport\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat happened here is unworthy of sports.\u201d\nMeanwhile, La Liga has indefinitely postponed a round of Covid-19 tests that they had proposed to carry out on Spain\u2019s first-and-second division players next week as a preliminary step towards a return to training.\nThe league wrote to the clubs informing them of the decision on Friday afternoon, as they continue to await a green light from the ministry of health. It had anticipated permission to be granted soon and hoped to begin testing on 28 April with a view to subsequently beginning a four-phase protocol for a return to training in the second week of May but the preliminary round of tests now appear set to be suspended.\nThe league wrote to clubs amid criticism for plans that involved ever player undergoing tests next week and then daily antibody tests for a month upon the implementation of the protocol. Some questioned how that could be justified at a time when front line medical staff have not been tested for Covid-19. The head of the supreme sports council (the CSD) and in effect the minister for sport, Irene Lozano, had expressed a commitment to help complete the football season. A CSD statement insisted that sport has an important social and economic role to play. But the decision remains in the hands of the ministry of health and it is yet to give the go-ahead.\nThe protocol remains in place, ready to be activated, and the league told clubs that it hoped the delay would be \u201cas short as possible\u201d.",

In other words, businesses have to front the money to pay their workers for each month, and then claim it back through the tax office.\nThis has left many businesses, particularly in the sectors worst hit such as hospitality, with an unbridgeable gap of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars that they need to pay now to get into the program, but just don\u2019t have.\nNone of this is the fault of Australia\u2019s banks \u2013 it is instead a fundamental flaw in the way the program was designed by Morrison and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg.\nAnd expecting businesses that are already broke to borrow more money is also pretty rich.\nBanks have so far loaned $700m to businesses to help them get through the crisis \u2013 which sounds like a lot but really isn\u2019t anywhere near enough.\nGuardian Australia understands about half has come from Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, and reports from businesses suggest smaller banks have struggled to get their systems up to scratch quickly.\nBut the big problem with going to the bank is that businesses are borrowing to get behind.\nThis is, once again, because the jobkeeper payment is made after the fact.\nIf you borrow $100,000 to meet this month\u2019s payroll, you will be able to pay it back next month \u2026 and have to immediately borrow the money again to meet the next month\u2019s payroll.\nWhile banks are offering an interest deferral for six months, that just means interest payments are quietly compounding in the background, ready to mug business owners when the crisis is over and they\u2019re expected to resume making payments.\nAs a result, many businesses have done the sums and closed their doors rather than get further into hock.\nFor the Liberal party, which is supposed to be the champion of small business, a failure to understand the basics of cashflow seems mind-boggling.\nBut the Morrison government made two design decisions that made this problem inevitable.\nFirst, they decided not to pay workers directly, as the UK does \u2013 asked about this, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has previously claimed this \u201cwould not work\u201d in Australia.\nHe\u2019s never really explained why, given that the Rudd government was able to use ATO systems to put government money in people\u2019s bank accounts during the global financial crisis.\nOnce the government decided to use the business tax system to make the payments, they made the second decision that ensured things would go wrong: to pay in arrears.\nOne of the attractions of using the business tax system to make payments is that tax boffins have a very good idea of the finances of every business in Australia because of a system called single touch payroll, which requires businesses to send wages, super and tax information to the ATO at the same time as they do their regular payroll run.\nThis means the ATO will be able to check that correct jobkeeper payments have been made.\nBut it also means that payments could also be made in advance, and then checked against the actual payroll.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nPerhaps there were technical reasons why this couldn\u2019t happen, or perhaps the risk of fraud was judged too great. But this was never explained.\nThe jobkeeper debacle also points to a wider problem with the Morrison government\u2019s response to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRight from the start, in the long-forgotten first stimulus package, it insisted on funnelling everything through the business tax system.\nBack then \u2013 it was only six weeks, but it feels like a year ago \u2013 Morrison and Frydenberg reckoned they could get economic activity going by offering tax breaks for spending on capital works.\nBut, as I said back then: \u201cIf, as seems likely, major events are cancelled, people are working from home and your restaurant is shut, why would you buy a new kitchen?\u201d\nThe rolling series of exponentially larger spending packages rolled out over the weeks following that first announcement at least indicate that the government realised it needed to do a lot more than offer a few tax lollies to small businesses.\nAnd Morrison is now trying to patch jobkeeper up by getting the big four banks to set up a hotline for small businesses who need an urgent loan.\nBut the failure to design packages such as jobkeeper properly in the first place will have cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of jobs, throwing people on to the unemployment line.\nAnd even if businesses can now get a concessional loan to start making payments, four to six crucial weeks of income for workers who desperately need the money has been ripped away.\nThis will inevitably ripple through the economy, although we won\u2019t be able to see the full effect for months.\nThe whole thing is an inexplicable policy failure, compounded by the impulse to blame an easy target \u2013 the banks \u2013 rather than own up and fix it.",

Then, 90% of the threatened marsupial\u2019s habitat was burned in January\u2019s bushfires.\nBut in some rare good news, researchers revealed on Tuesday that their cameras had captured the creature in new locations \u2013 boosting hopes that it could be saved from the brink.\nAccused drug-driver Richard Pusey allegedly filmed and yelled at a police officer as she was dying, after he had been stopped for speeding in his Porsche in Melbourne.\nFour police officers were killed on Wednesday when they were hit by a truck while they were impounding Pusey\u2019s car on the Eastern Freeway. Pusey allegedly filmed a senior constable as she was calling for help, before fleeing the scene, a court was told on Friday.\nTech giants Facebook and Google will be forced to share their advertising revenue with newspapers, at the request of treasurer Josh Frydenberg, as the coronavirus pandemic devastates local media.\nThe companies will now need to negotiate in good faith on how to pay news media for using their content, an arrangement to be enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\nSixteen people across five Australian states have been charged with child exploitation offences after a two-year investigation across Australia and the US.\nFour children were removed from harm as a result of the arrests.\nQueensland man Nicholas John Crilley has pleaded guilty to attacking, sexually assaulting and burning a 22-year old woman over three weeks of drug-induced violence.\nCrilley, 34, plead guilty to 54 offences that occurred in June 2017. He will be sentenced on 1 May.\nThe CEO of Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle, resigned on Thursday after being told she had lost the support of the board. Castle said the board told her they needed \u201cclear air\u201d. On Friday, the chairman, Paul McLean, said Castle had suffered \u201cabhorrent\u201d bullying from \u201cfaceless people\u201d during her entire tenure.\nAnd finally, the fallout from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new memoir continues. After excerpts were variously leaked and published last week, it emerged that a senior adviser to Scott Morrison had sent pirated copies to at least 59 people.\nThe foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, both said they received copies, as the book\u2019s publisher Hardie Grant said it would refer the issue to the Australian federal police.\nThe adviser, Nico Louw, later apologised and settled with Hardie Grant, as booksellers declared it a bestseller.\nAnd in an interview with Guardian Australia, the former PM said his new role would be of a citizen and \u201cactivist\u201d, commenting on public issues. \u201cThere is no shortage of fora to get your views across nowadays,\u201d he said.",

For the first time since OKT Primary opened on 23 March they\u2019re really happy to be in class.\nWell then, for starters, it\u2019s Mr Ag\u00fcero to you, or Se\u00f1or Ag\u00fcero, or possibly Profe. And second of all, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not coming, yet. Boooo!\nAg\u00fcero is one of the stars signed up to the BBC Bitesize Daily, the corporation\u2019s biggest ever education programme, launched on Monday to help parents during lockdown. Lord knows, we need it. Actually we\u2019re lucky in this house; the other (some say the only) adult is an actual primary school teacher, which means she\u2019s both here, and knows what she\u2019s doing. Otherwise we\u2019d definitely be in special measures by now. Still, any help is appreciated.\nSergio\u2019s Spanish isn\u2019t online yet. To be honest I was more excited about Danny Dyer\u2019s history classes (when he learns ya, you\u2019ll stay learned) but they\u2019re also not there yet. There\u2019s plenty to be getting involved with, new lessons going up every day. We\u2019re year one and year three, so sit down, shut up, today\u2019s first class in year one English: when to use question marks.\nWe watch a short animated video, about when to use question marks. Next clip we see is going to be about a book called The Magic Faraway Tree, but first we have to prepare some questions for the four children in the story using question words. We\u2019ve actually read Enid Blyton\u2019s classic, it\u2019s something of a favourite; so one of the questions, directed at two of the characters, is: why have your names been changed to Rick and Franny, from the original Dick and Fanny? Cue an untimetabled \u2013 and woefully unprepared \u2013 biology lesson. A reasonable and correctly formed question though.\nThe video, when we eventually get to it, is a lovely one. Naomi Wilkinson, talking about and reading from the book in a real tree. As she does so, she climbs ever higher, dodging Dame Washalot\u2019s animated wastewater, towards strange and magic lands high above\u2026\nImmediately striking about the clip, and the animated one before it, is its quality. Our homeschool headteacher says she regularly uses BBC Bitesize material (which has been around for ages, it\u2019s just the daily lockdown lessons that are new) in real school, for this reason. It\u2019s professional, well-planned, imaginative, varied, enjoyable, often funny, kids like it, teachers like it \u2026 My favourite history teacher (even though he\u2019s yet to teach us) might call it \u201cthe absolutely bollocks\u201d. Almost like these BBC people have done this kind of thing \u2013 making films, education \u2013 before\u2026\nThe good marks continue throughout our week. In year one maths, we count on and back in twos, then fives, practising with raisins, which disappear, in tens. And Seymour Science introduces us to the seasons, which we draw.\nMoving up to year three, in English we identify adjectives, with help from a scary, smelly yeti; then make more powerful adjectives, like terrifying and stinky. And in geography we are introduced to maps by tourist Sue Venir. This pleases me because children today can\u2019t read maps. Then we have to make our own maps, of the local area. Yes? No we can\u2019t go on Google Maps and copy it \u2026 Can we?\nWhat about working with a mixed aged class, years one and three round the same table? You know what, it\u2019s OK. The idea of scale, 1:250,000, is certainly tricky for a six-year-old to get a hold of but there is other more graspable stuff, and, because the material is engaging and entertaining, they want to. I\u2019m also finding that with all the practice and activities that follow the presentation, I can set one off, leave him, go back to the other, run two classes at the same time, juggling year three History with year one Music, I\u2019m amazing at this\u2026\nNo, obviously I\u2019m not. If I\u2019ve learned one thing since 23 March it\u2019s to massively respect the teaching professor. Damn, it\u2019s hard. But there\u2019s a point here too; if I can use this stuff, anyone can. Not only is it all those things already mentioned, it\u2019s easy to use, and it works.\nA working printer would help for some of the worksheets; no one has a working printer at home, do they? There are ways around it. Possibly a more serious issue is that this obviously comes via a screen in a time when limiting screen time might feel like a losing battle. I can\u2019t see a way round that one.\nNext week we\u2019ll be trying out the daily lessons on Netflix and Amazon Prime \u2026 no we won\u2019t, there aren\u2019t any. So, hands off the BBC, yes, you lurking at the back, Cummings. And what are you wearing, see me after class.\nOverall then, marks out of 10 for BBC Bitesize Daily, from the staff and pupils of OKT Primary? Well, we were very disappointed about Ag\u00fcero not coming. Also Dyer, David Attenborough, Jodie Whitaker, Liam Payne, all the starry names being shouted at the launch. What\u2019s wrong with these people, don\u2019t they know that the first rule of teaching is to arrive on time?\nBut, hey, maybe the classroom doesn\u2019t need celebrities. The material is fab. If Sergio does show up, if he could just turn round, so everyone can see the number on his back \u2026 Yup, that\u2019ll be a big fat diez."

        "content": "With a warm weekend ahead, Governor Gavin Newsom will allow use of some open spaces with restrictions\nCalifornia is reopening some beaches as the state heads into a hot weekend, with the governor urging residents to practice strict physical distancing if they go outside.\nWhile many Los Angeles area beaches remain closed to the public due to Covid-19, a handful will allow visitors in a limited capacity while adopting a wide range of restrictions, enforcement plans and recommendations.\nCalifornia ordered one of the earliest lockdowns in the country last month and has made some progress in slowing the spread of the virus. Gavin Newsom, the governor, said he did not want to have to report a surge in cases due to residents being irresponsible in the warm weather, with weekend temperatures expected to climb above 90F (32C) in some areas.\n\u201cPeople are prone to want to go to the beaches, parks, playgrounds and go on a hike,\u201d Newsom said in a news briefing on Thursday after announcing that California had suffered its deadliest day since the start of the outbreak. \u201cIf it is open, just abide by social distancing.\u201d\nThe policies vary widely across regions. In Ventura county, north of LA, officials have relaxed beach closure rules, saying residents can now visit and walk on the sand or pier but should not sit down or fish.\nIn San Clemente, Orange county, the local council voted to reopen the beach for recreational activity such as walking, running, swimming and surfing, but it also said residents should not bring a blanket and hang out. The city is attempting to limit access to local residents by keeping parking lots closed, and other Orange county officials have urged out-of-town residents not to visit the beaches and parks that remain open.\nIn LA, popular beach and park spots remain largely closed, including the world-famous pier and boardwalk at Venice Beach.\nThe question of beach closures has sparked intense debate across the US, which is likely to become more contentious if various lockdowns and restrictions continue into the summer. The reopening of the beaches in Florida last week led to backlash from some who feared early moves to ease restrictions could fuel a second wave of Covid-19.\nSome experts, however, have argued that governments should find ways to allow people to visit beaches while strongly encouraging distancing, mask-wearing and other safety measures. Getting outside can benefit people\u2019s health, and there are concerns that overly broad restrictions on public spaces could result in people gathering indoors, which would be more dangerous.\n\u201cOutdoor access has strongly proven links to mental health, emotional wellness, physical health,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, policy director for Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, an environmental justice group in California. \u201cWe certainly trust the expertise of public health officials. But like so many other social and economic disparities, access to open space was an issue of huge inequality before the crisis.\u201d\nZucker was wary of rules that tried to limit beach access to residents of the municipalities on the coast, noting that the population of those cities, such as Santa Monica and Venice, is generally wealthier and less diverse.\nIn southern California, the surfing community has also been divided on the beach rules, with an informal poll by the Surfer publication finding that many surfers believed they could practice safe social distancing while on the water and were opposed to restrictions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing surfers getting a kind of itch that they are not familiar with,\u201d said Todd Prodanovich, editor of Surfer, noting that there was no precedent for this kind of indefinite shutdown of so many beaches.\nBut Prodanovich also said he had no interest in trying to protest against government orders: \u201cDo I miss surfing? Yes. Do I think a lot of surfers could do this safely? Yes. Do I think it\u2019s so important for us to surf right now that public health officials should be accommodating us over whatever larger plan they have? No. We\u2019re just having fun in the ocean.\u201d",

Giroud\u2019s current deal runs out on 30 June and he has been linked with Internazionale, who have maintained their interest in the 33-year-old after missing out on signing him in January.\nThe former Arsenal striker\u2019s frustration with his lack of playing time almost culminated in him leaving Chelsea during the winter transfer window, only for the west Londoners to block his hopes of a reunion with Antonio Conte at Inter. Lazio and Tottenham also showed interest in the French World Cup winner but Frank Lampard decided that he could not sanction a sale after failing to land any of his forward targets in January.\nGiroud spent the early part of Lampard\u2019s reign kicking his heels on the sidelines. Tammy Abraham was Lampard\u2019s first choice to lead the line and Chelsea\u2019s manager often chose to use Michy Batshuayi off the bench instead of Giroud.\nHowever, the situation changed when Abraham suffered an ankle injury against Arsenal in January. Giroud remained professional, working hard in training, and he managed to work his way back into Lampard\u2019s plans. Fine goals in excellent home wins over Everton and Spurs were richly deserved rewards for his efforts on the training ground.\nThe possibility remains that Chelsea could still sell Giroud if they receive a lucrative offer for him. However, there is no date set for the resumption of the season and recruitment plans are up in the air because of the coronavirus crisis. With that in mind, Chelsea have recognised the value of protecting their asset.\nChelsea are also close to reaching an agreement with their players over a 10% pay cut. Lampard is also understood to be happy to reduce his salary.",

One of the greatest joys in reading the notebooks is that, when the first birds arrive, you can tell the mounting excitement that he has. It is palpable in the pages \u2026 it blows his mind.\u201d\nLevick was shocked by elements of penguin behaviour, documenting the excesses of young males, or \u201chooligan cocks\u201d, in Greek alphabet code. These include necrophilia, sexual abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour.\nBut that\u2019s penguins for you. \u201cThe thing with penguins is that sperm is cheap,\u201d said Russell. \u201cThey have one over-riding aim which is to fertilise and bring on the next generation \u2026 the birds will pretty much have sex with anything.\u201d\nThe notebooks are particularly important because the area Levick was studying, Ridley Beach on Cape Adare, is still home to around 335,000 Ad\u00e9lie penguins, the largest colony in the world. But, scientists predict, not for much longer.\n\u201cAs we see rising sea levels, it is highly likely that the entire colony will move. Part of the value here is that this is an account of an area that will one day be lost, it will all be reclaimed by the sea.\n\u201cAs a scientist, Levick was decades ahead of his time and now, more than 100 years later, his words still have much to tell us,\u201d said Russell.\nThe survival of the notebooks is all the more remarkable because of what Levick and five others endured after their time on Cape Adare when they were unable, after the death of Scott, to re-embark on the Terra Nova.\nEffectively marooned, they were forced to make an ice cave where they lived for seven months surviving on blubber and birds they had killed. After living in \u201cutterly horrendous\u201d conditions, Levick then walked 200 miles back to home camp.\n\u201cHis ability to weather this storm is extraordinary,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI do think there is a massive parallel for us all in that whatever we think of as isolation, we are nowhere near what Levick went through. Maybe it gives us the ability to look at things in context.\u201d\nThe announcement was made to coincide with world penguin day. The museum plans to make the notebooks physically and digitally available for future research, outreach and education\nAndrea Hart, head of special collections at the museum, said: \u201cThe Levick notebooks are a vital addition to our existing collection and the scientific observations held in original manuscripts such as these remain as relevant and important today as when they were first created.\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted that Levick\u2019s work can now be accessed by academics, researchers and the public, more than a century after his seminal trip to Antarctica.\u201d",

The news agency cites three people familiar with the situation.\nThe trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. There was no indication of what, if anything, it signalled in terms of Kim\u2019s health.\nThe airline will receive a \u20ac7bn (\u00a36.1bn) loan package backed by the French government to avert a cash crisis brought on by the pandemic, the country\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announces.\nFrance will issue \u20ac3bn in direct loans and guarantees on another \u20ac4bn in bank lending to the carrier, part of airline group Air France-KLM, Le Maire said.\nSenior officials recommend the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, who was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard.\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, officials told the Reuters news agency the recommendation to reinstate Captain Brett Crozier was made during a meeting on Friday between the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, and navy leaders.\nThe Department for Health and Social Care reports 684 more deaths in UK hospitals, bringing the death toll to 19,506. Friday\u2019s update also showed an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to at least 143,464.\nAuthorities in Spain, which has seen the second largest number of confirmed cases in the world, pointed out that more people are being diagnosed as cured than are falling sick for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak.\nOn Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. \u201cWith all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the ministry\u2019s health emergency centre coordinator.\nNewspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks.

We\u2019ve welcomed back herb robert and red campion, dandelion and bugle, and the place heaves with birds, rabbits and voles. But in a lockdown-induced fit of horticultural zeal, I recently begged two big old raised beds from our kindly farmer neighbour. After we\u2019d heaved them into position, a digger rumbled down the lane and deposited a half-tonne of local topsoil in one deft dump. That is my kind of gardening.\nFarmer John warned that I\u2019d have to pick out the stones and weeds, and after shovelling in most of our compost heap I set to \u2013 raking with my hands, crushing lumps, rubbing in blobs of clay and manure like butter into scone mix.

You could document every physical, chemical and biological property of this substance and still not describe it, because soil seethes with history too.\nThe land adjoining this was once a quarry and most of the fragments I extract are limestone, but there is brick and pot too. Before the quarry, there was a Roman pottery, mass-producing what is now known as Crambeck ware for distribution all over the north of England. John tells me he finds fragments of huge coil pots that look like fossil turds, evidence of much earlier native potters at work in the bronze- and iron-age settlements that were here long before the Romans.\nIn temporarily taming this indescribable amalgam, I\u2019ve sloughed my own biological signature into it, and added those of carrots and beets, beans and borage.

        "content": "Leading US biologist Thomas Lovejoy says to stop future outbreaks we need more respect for natural world\nThe vast illegal wildlife trade and humanity\u2019s excessive intrusion into nature is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading US scientist who says \u201cthis is not nature\u2019s revenge, we did it to ourselves\u201d.\nScientists are discovering two to four new viruses are created every year as a result of human infringement on the natural world, and any one of those could turn into a pandemic, according to Thomas Lovejoy, who coined the term \u201cbiological diversity\u201d in 1980 and is often referred to as the godfather of biodiversity.\n\u201cThis pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular, the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa\u2026 It\u2019s pretty obvious, it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,\u201d said Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and professor of environment science at George Mason University.\nHis comments were made to mark the release of a report by the Center for American Progress arguing that the US should step up efforts to combat the wildlife trade to help confront pandemics.\nWet markets are traditional markets selling live animals (farmed and wild) as well as fresh fruit, vegetables and fish, often in unhygienic conditions. They are found all over Africa and Asia, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of people. The wet market in Wuhan believed to be the source of Covid-19 contained a number of wild animals, including foxes, rats, squirrels, wolf pups and salamanders.\nLovejoy said separating wild animals from farmed animals in markets would significantly lower the risk of disease transmission. This is because there would be fewer new species for viruses to latch on to. \u201c[Domesticated animals] can acquire these viruses, but if that\u2019s all there was in the market, it would really lower the probability of a leak from a wild animal to a domesticated animal.\u201d\nHe told the Guardian: \u201cThe name of the game is reducing certain amounts of activity so the probability of that kind of leap becomes small enough that it\u2019s inconsequential. The big difficulty is that if you just shut them down \u2013 which in many ways would be the ideal thing \u2013 they will be topped up with black markets, and that\u2019s even harder to deal with because it\u2019s clandestine.\u201d\nThe pandemic will cost the global economy $1tn this year, according to the World Economic Forum, with vulnerable communities impacted the most, and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. \u201cThis is not nature\u2019s revenge, we did it to ourselves. The solution is to have a much more respectful approach to nature, which includes dealing with climate change and all the rest,\u201d Lovejoy said.\nHis comments echo those of a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B earlier this month that suggested the underlying cause of the present pandemic was likely to be increased human contact with wildlife.\nExperts are divided about how to regulate the vast trade in animals, with many concerned the poorest are most at risk from a crackdown. Urgent action on the wildlife trade is clearly needed, said Dr Amy Dickman, a conservation biologist from the University of Oxford, but she was \u201calarmed\u201d by calls for indiscriminate bans on the wildlife trade.\nShe is one of more than 250 signatories of an open letter to the World Health Organization and United Nations Environment Programme saying any transition must contribute to \u2013 and not detract from \u2013 the livelihoods of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, many of whom depend on wild resources for survival. Other signatories include representatives from the African Wildlife Foundation, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).\nThe letter reads: \u201cCovid-19 is inflicting unprecedented social and economic costs on countries and communities, with the poor and vulnerable hardest hit. The virus\u2019s suspected links with a Chinese \u2018wet market\u2019 has led to calls to ban wet markets and restrict or end the trade, medicinal use and consumption of wildlife. However, indiscriminate bans and restrictions risk being inequitable and ineffective.\u201d\nScientists and NGOs are concerned that over-simplistic and indiscriminate restrictions will exacerbate poverty and inequality, resulting in an increase in criminality. This could accelerate the exploitation and extinction of species in the wild, authors of the letter warn.\n\u201cPeople often seem more willing to point the finger at markets far away, as bans there will not affect their everyday lives \u2013 although they will often affect the rights of extremely vulnerable people,\u201d said Dickman.\nThere are also concerns about the impacts of an outright ban on a number of indigenous populations, such as tribes in Orinoquia and Amazonia, with representatives describing it as an \u201cattack\u201d on their livelihoods.\nMama Mouamfon, who is based in Cameroon and directs an NGO called Fondation Camerounaise de la Terre Vivante (FCTV), said banning the trade would damage livelihoods: \u201cBush meat is very important for people in the forest because it\u2019s one of the best ways to get animal protein. With this issue of poverty and people living in remote areas, it\u2019s not easy for them to look for good meat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSometimes people take decisions because they are sitting in an office and are very far from reality. If they knew our reality they would not take that [same] decision.\u201d",

        "content": "The Living Archive aims to help people worldwide see the significance of species loss as it affects individual lives and places\nThe first time poet Craig Santos Perez encountered a bird native to his homeland of Guam it was in a cage at San Diego zoo.\nGrowing up on Guam in the 1980s and 90s, Perez, a native Chamorro, had learned about the island\u2019s lost birds at school. Children studied pictures and listened to audio recordings of their calls \u2013 but by then, the island\u2019s forests were silent.\nOf Guam\u2019s original 12 species of forest birds, ten had been eaten to extinction by the invasive brown tree snake. Just two narrowly escaped its jaws: the Guam rail and an endemic subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher, which the Chamorro call sihek.\nIn the late 1980s, the last siheks were taken off the island to be reared in captive breeding programmes at zoos on the American mainland. Though there are now plans to release some on Guam, they are still considered extinct in the wild.\nThat day at the zoo, Perez finally came face to face with a real-life sihek, its gold-and-turquoise feathers shining behind the bars. \u201cIt was very profound, very touching \u2013 I talked to it, and started crying,\u201d he says.\nTo Perez, the bird\u2019s fate echoed that of his people: San Diego is home to the largest diaspora of Chamorros outside of Guam. For many years, Perez was one of them. \u201cWe migrate to survive and to have better opportunities, but at the same time, we\u2019re far from home, we\u2019re in a new situation, and it can be very traumatic \u2013 for the sihek as well as the people.\u201d\nA poem Perez wrote about the sihek is among those featured on the Living Archive, a new multimedia web platform that provides a space for people from Oceania to tell their \u201cextinction stories\u201d.\n\u201cWhen a species goes extinct, so much is lost,\u201d says Perez, who is now an associate professor of English at the University of Hawaii. \u201cNot only from the environment and the ecosystem, but culturally as well. We lose our cultural connection to these important species, and we lose the deep meaning that they added to our lives.\u201d\nThe site is the brainchild of Thom van Dooren, an Australian environmental philosopher at the University of Sydney. He hopes it will be a way of creating space for others \u2013 especially the Pacific\u2019s indigenous peoples, but anyone is welcome to contribute \u2013 to share their tales of love and loss. A storytelling competition will be held later in the year.\nAs the sixth great extinction gathers pace, stories are more important than ever, van Dooren says. \u201cFocusing on stories is about moving away from the simple listing of endangered species.\n\u201cMultiplying voices and diverse perspectives from around the world helps us to see the significance of extinction as it actually touches down in particular lives and places.\u201d\nIn Indonesia\u2019s West Papua province, it is the disappearance of the sago palm that is causing heartbreak for the indigenous Marind people. To the Marind, the plant is of central significance for both subsistence and cosmology, but Papua is the new oil palm frontier, and as plantations spread across the landscape, groves of sago are being destroyed.\n\u201cEven though the communities I work with are facing all kinds of adverse social impacts from this deforestation, whenever I asked them what the worst impact was, they would invariably tell me that \u2018oil palm kills the sago\u2019,\u201d says Sophie Chao, an anthropologist from the University of Sydney who has spent a decade living alongside the Marind.\n\u201cThey would almost place the fate of this tree before their own lives \u2026 it was the threat to the sago, this nourishing, life-giving plant, that they considered to be the most dramatic rupture caused by deforestation and oil-palm expansion.\u201d\nTogether with members of the Marind community, Chao co-wrote an extinction story about sago for the Living Archive. It includes a translation of a song sung to the plant by a Marind elder: \u201cFrom eating sago, we grew bone; from eating sago, we knew home.\u201d\nMarind call themselves \u201csago people\u201d, and the palm entwines with every aspect of their life, Chao says. Children are said to grow best in the company of sago, and particular palms are named after children that came into the world at the same time. Those babies are often carried in bags made from the fronds of their namesake palm so that, as one young mother told Chao, \u201csago and Marind can follow each other\u2019s lives\u201d.\nPeople also talk about being \u201cgood food for sago\u201d, Chao says. Palm starch nourishes the Marind through their life; but when a person dies, they must be buried in a sago grove so that their body becomes food for the microorganisms that in turn feed the forest\u2019s roots.\nNow, conventional palm oil companies clear-cut the groves, and even \u201csustainable\u201d projects can exclude local people from conservation zones, severing the Marind\u2019s lifelong connection to their kindred sago.\n\u201cThis plant is culturally meaningful, and it is politically meaningful too,\u201d says Chao.\n\u201cWhen people are talking about this kind of localised extinction they are also speaking about what they see as their own possible extinction as West Papuan people: the cultural dilution, forced sterilisation, systemic incarceration, and all sorts of other processes that are very much part of the collective identity of West Papuans.\u201d\nAnd yet, the whole point of the Living Archive is to \u201cavoid the politics of despair,\u201d Chao says. As she tells in her extinction story, the Marind themselves have found some hope and resilience in the possibility of reaching a kind of understanding with oil palm: \u201cSo we cannot deny ourselves hope when they are finding glimmers amid the rubble!\u201d\nThere is power in good stories, Chao says. \u201cThey might not be able to change the status quo or the structural processes and violence that are causing extinctions, but caring matters. Fleshy stories make us care more.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019re more important now than ever, van Dooren says. Covid19 is seen by many as a product of a dysfunctional relationship between humans and animals, and the broader environment too.\n\u201cExtinction is only part of that puzzle but it\u2019s a significant part - it\u2019s a symptom of a broader set of problematic relationships that we\u2019re being reminded of, not just by Covid 19, but by climate change.\n\u201cStorytelling is a big part of how we manage those relationships and how we imagine other possibilities.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\n This article was amended on 27 April 2020.

        "content": "Academics and students had criticised the plans for being unworkable and damaging to the university\u2019s reputation\nDurham University has retracted controversial plans to provide online-only degrees due to the coronavirus pandemic following a backlash from students and lecturers.\nThe university\u2019s senate was due to vote on a resolution that would see Durham develop a range of online degrees to \u201ccomplement its existing high quality residential educational programme\u201d.\nBut it was withdrawn on Wednesday after many senate members expressed opposition to the proposals.\nThe plans, which would also reduce the number of modules taught in person by a quarter in the next academic year, were condemned by the Department of English as \u201cdangerous and damaging to the short- and long-term viability of the university\u201d.\nThe department\u2019s submission to the senate, seen by the Guardian, criticised suggestions from a private education firm consulted on the plans that lecturers would only need six hours training in order to teach online.\nThe document said Cambridge Education Digital\u2019s estimation of the work required to shift learning online displayed no realistic sense of the realities the staffing and technological support required to develop and deliver it. \u201cTraining staff to teach effectively online will take far, far more than the six hours indicated,\u201d it added.\nThe submission also warned the plans posed a potential conflict of interest because CEG Digital is owned by private equity group Bridgepoint Capital, whose chief investment officer is a member of Durham\u2019s \u2018chancellor\u2019s circle\u2019 of donors.\nThe plans will now be returned to the university\u2019s council, where they will be redrawn before being returned to the senate.\nMore than 1,000 current and prospective Durham students signed a petition opposing the plans, with a letter sent to heads of departments ahead of the senate meeting adding that \u201conline teaching should not be considered an equitable substitute to in person degree\u201d. Nearly 500 academics also signed a letter opposing the proposals.\nDurham\u2019s vice-chancellor Stuart Corbridge said: \u201cThe university continues to plan for a full residential teaching offer in October while also ensuring that teaching can go online if there is a lockdown later in the year.\u201d\nThe University and College Union, which represents lecturers, described the proposals as \u201can attack on the livelihoods and the professional expertise of hard-working staff\u201d.\nUCU general secretary Jo Grady said: \u201cThe best way to ensure universities offer the best for students is to work with us and ensure any changes are led by staff, not imposed from above.\u201d\nA Durham University spokesman said: \u201cWe have engaged CEG Digital to help us understand the online education market and to support our excellent staff deliver their teaching online, if this is required by COVID-19 restrictions.\n\u201cWe followed due process in awarding both of these contracts.\u201d",

        "content": "The pandemic has underlined what we have have long tacitly known: that the schedule is full well beyond breaking point\nTom Harrison is the sort of guy you want in a crisis. Mainly due to his masterful refusal to acknowledge the fact that there\u2019s a crisis at all. As the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered his latest update on how the game intends to weather the coronavirus pandemic, you wondered whether he had been watching the same sombre bulletins as the rest of us.\nThe forestalment of the season until 1 July, with the prospect of further setbacks to come, provided \u201can opportunity, as much as anything\u201d. The challenge of rejigging a schedule already ransacked by cancellations and postponements was \u201can interesting experiment\u201d. The spirit of cooperation within the game, Harrison insisted, was \u201cvery, very positive and optimistic\u201d. By the end of it, you felt weirdly buoyant about the whole scenario. Hurrah for Covid-19! Three cheers for cricket! A clap for our brave, heroic stakeholders!\nThere was something strange about the room Harrison was sitting in. Hanging on the wall behind him, in what you had to assume was his living room or home office, were about half a dozen framed photographs of idyllic, sun-kissed landscapes: the sort of generic pictures that often come free with the frame when you buy them. Blissfully deserted beaches. Swaying palm trees. Postcard sunsets. It felt like a subliminal attempt to convey a message of extreme calm.\nOf course, there is plenty to be said for maintaining a certain optimism at a time like this, particularly when there are some gut-wrenching decisions to be delegated in the weeks ahead. On the substance of those decisions, however, there was rather less to go on. Still no word on where things stand with the broadcasters. Still no word on the Hundred, whose fate will be decided at a further meeting next Wednesday. Still no word on what, if any, domestic cricket would take place in a truncated season.\nThere are no answers, because at present there can be no answers. English cricket, like many of its overseas counterparts and in common with many other sports, has its hands tied by a schedule and a wider culture that for years has been geared in just one direction: towards more of everything. More formats and more fixtures, stretching ever earlier into spring and ever later into autumn, squeezing the gaps in the calendar until players are delirious with fatigue and the red-ball and white-ball games have been driven irreconcilably apart.\nUntil now there has been no incentive to rationalise any of this, because nobody ever made their fortune in cricket by arguing for less of it. In a way, the pandemic has merely underlined what we have long tacitly known: that the schedule is full well beyond breaking point. That when you are blithely insisting it is possible to schedule four domestic competitions and four men\u2019s international series in the space of three months, when you are unable to extend the season by more than a few weeks because that would bring it in direct conflict with a Twenty20 World Cup in Australia, a point of absurdity has long been passed.\nThe only real questions, then, are what we lose, and in what order. The County Championship and the One-Day Cup, almost certainly. The Hundred will surely have to go back in the can for a year. In practice, it\u2019s hard to see how the epidemiological tide could turn in time for a white-ball series against Australia to be sanctioned. England\u2019s international summer could well consist of four four-day Tests, two against West Indies, two against Pakistan \u2013 the minimum length for a World Test Championship series \u2013 held without crowds at a bio-secure Rose Bowl or Old Trafford in September.\nAs for women\u2019s cricket, the ECB will surely be aware of the optics of busting a gut to salvage the men\u2019s international calendar, while simultaneously allowing the women\u2019s summer \u2013 six ODIs and six T20s against India and South Africa \u2013 to disappear without comment. But when asked whether he could offer a guarantee that if all the men\u2019s international fixtures could be scheduled, all the women\u2019s games would be played too, he pointedly could not.\nYou could ask similar questions about other areas of the game: about counties going under, players and staff struggling to make ends meet, clubs shutting their doors never to open them again. But that\u2019s not really the \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d the ECB wants to engender right now. This is, after all, a huge opportunity to imagineer the future of English cricket. And it\u2019s only right we embrace it with the enthusiasm it demands.",

        "content": "Heads say the Covid-19 lockdown means this year\u2019s 11-plus cannot be fair, as many poorer children are unable to revise online\nIn this time of crisis, exams are off: GCSEs, A-levels, Sats. All except one \u2026 the 11-plus, a test that was phased out in most parts of the country decades ago, but that means everything to families in areas still operating a system of grammars and de facto secondary moderns.\nA quick scan of grammar school websites around the country shows that, so far, it is business as usual. The entire world may have stopped in its tracks but, in early September, after possibly months out of school, thousands of 10-year-olds look set to sit this series of tests to determine their secondary-school future.\nIlesh Kotecha, the founder and director of Eleven Plus Exams, a tutoring and resources centre that provides information and advice nationally, says it is very unlikely the 11-plus will be cancelled. Instead, he says, headteachers are being tentatively told to prepare to reopen their schools between four and eight weeks from now.\nThe decision to go ahead looks increasingly ill-judged as the lockdown extends, particularly given the well-established statistics on the low numbers of disadvantaged children accessing grammar schools in a normal year, and emerging evidence of the rapid widening of the educational gap as a result of coronavirus.\nRecent surveys from Teacher Tapp, Public First and the Sutton Trust confirm that while children at independent schools are receiving significantly more online lessons, only 33% of those from low-income homes spend more than four hours a day learning at home. And some headteachers have said that in their school, up to 40% of pupils do not have a home computer. Many have no internet or phone either.\nTracy Thomas, headteacher of Marden primary school in Kent, the largest remaining grammar-school area in the country, says: \u201cI fear that the gap this year [in terms of 11-plus admissions] will be greater than ever.\u201d\nKathryn Evans, an assistant head and year 6 teacher in Maidstone, Kent, points to an early feature of the lockdown in grammar-school areas. \u201cState primary schools are not allowed to prepare children for the test. Even so, around this time, we would be alerting parents to the fact that the test was coming up and would be there to answer any of their questions.\u201d Instead, she and her colleagues are \u201ctrying to get in touch with vulnerable families, and keep some sort of education going\u201d.\nZoe Catania is a co-founder of Aim, a small charity that helps prepare children from low-income homes for the Kent test. She says the crisis will have a \u201cmassive impact\u201d. \u201cEven the brightest children need familiarisation with parts of the test, particularly verbal and non-verbal reasoning.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Kotecha says children who attend state schools will be disadvantaged unless their parents can provide teaching and practice during the lockdown. He says independent prep schools are \u201cteaching a full timetable, expecting the child to begin online at 8.30 or 9am at the latest and work until 3.30pm to justify the fees. State school children don\u2019t get this online service, because often their schools struggle for a budget just for the basics.\n\u201cDuring this lockdown if a child is not getting practice at home, then they will not be as mentally agile when it comes to the actual exam as those who are kept on their toes and close to their peak performance.\u2019\nBut even families getting tutoring for free face additional problems. \u201cPrinters,\u201d says Catania. \u201cIt\u2019s striking the number of people who haven\u2019t got printers or who can\u2019t afford a printer cartridge. That\u2019s not just families on pupil premium. It goes far beyond that.\u201d\nIn a normal year, Aim offers three hours\u2019 free tutoring a week, additional activities, and runs a mock exam at a local test site in the spring. This year they are sending the mock test via computer. All entrants will sit the test, at the same time, in as near to exam conditions as they can. If parents are not able to print what might be up to 40 sheets of paper, Aim will deliver them by hand.\nMaria Hughes (not her real name), a single parent on universal credit, is preparing her year 5 daughter, with the help of Aim, for the Kent test. She counts herself lucky because she has \u201ca dining room table, a school laptop which I share with my two children, and an elderly relative locally who has a printer.\n\u201cI have to hold my phone by my relative\u2019s window so the bluetooth from my phone connects to the printer,\u201d she says. Her relative then hands her the printed pages through the window. It sounds complicated, but Hughes considers herself lucky: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have that, the whole thing would be a nightmare.\u201d\nBut the obstacles go well beyond tech, says Catania. \u201cLots of children haven\u2019t got space to sit quietly. Parents are out working, or they can\u2019t help. Then there\u2019s the impact for some children of missing out on tricky bits of the curriculum, like algebra.\u201d\nIt is hard to see how the government, or grammar schools themselves, can ignore the glaring unfairness of this year\u2019s exam. In recent years, the government has made cash for grammar school expansion contingent on increasing the numbers of disadvantaged pupils, though this has, in effect, been minimal.\nWhat are the options? Unlike every other public exam, the 11-plus cannot easily be replaced by assessment. Talking to teachers in selective areas, none wants to have to pick out the \u201cclever children\u201d in their year 6 class, with the resulting bad feeling between themselves and local families. And, as one parent, Maria Hughes, says, \u201cAssessment would be very difficult when you compare children from private prep versus primary schools.\u201d\nAbandoning the test is not feasible either. Selective areas are structured around the creation of a rigid divide at 11.\nEarly indications are that selective schools and areas are searching for a face-saving solution, perhaps tweaking their admissions to allow in more children from lower-income families.\nAnita Cranmer, Buckinghamshire council\u2019s cabinet member for education, says: \u201cWe recognise the impact the [coronavirus] disruption will have on children due to sit the secondary transfer test.\u201d The council is liaising with the Buckinghamshire Grammar Schools Group (TBGS), which owns and manages the test for Buckinghamshire, and with the test supplier, GL Assessment, \u201cto find a solution \u2026 and we are also in ongoing discussions with the Department for Education\u201d.\nThe only other option is postponement, possibly until January. But Hughes is sceptical: \u201cIf the schools go back before September, keep it the same. If they don\u2019t go back until September, then defer until the new year. But my daughter just wants it over and done with.\u201d",

        "content": "From Newcastle\u2019s takeover to wage deferral dramas, obsessions with the bottom line are in sharp focus without on-field action\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing at prime minister\u2019s questions in midweek was enlightening, in a number of ways. The content of his exchanges with the government\u2019s stand-in shot-stopper Dominic Raab is best discussed outside the sports pages \u2013 though I\u2019d summarise it as a knight against the benighted \u2013 but the atmosphere also intrigued. For there was hardly anybody there, a scant scattering of suited souls in the historic old chamber while the rest called in their questions, a situation that contrasted with the appearances in the same forum of some modern PMs, who have metaphorically phoned in their answers.\nThe absence of so many people resulted in a lack of the noise and bluster they normally bring with them. The whole thing was of course less of a spectacle as a result \u2013 with not as much to see and hear to distract us from the fact that watching a bloke talk evasively is not in itself particularly exciting \u2013 but also more instructive. With nothing to watch but the action, and denied the shortcut of ranking contributions by the amount of cheering and paper-waving they provoke, observers were left with no way of judging anything except by its own merits.\nResidents of cities around the world are reporting that the reduction in pollution during lockdowns has allowed them to see clearly for the first time in years, and viewers of the action in parliament found themselves experiencing, in a manner of speaking, a remarkably similar phenomenon. But the situation facing football is precisely the opposite: deprived of the action that once entertained us, now all we can see is the pollution that surrounds it.\nIt would be easy to go overboard here, ignoring the fact that clubs are at heart relatively small-scale community organisations largely staffed by considerate people. Hence initiatives such as #PlayersTogether, launched this month by the 20 captains of Premier League teams, and all sorts of smaller, less publicity-hungry schemes including antenatal appointments being quietly relocated from North Middlesex University hospital to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, David Moyes delivering fruit and veg to Lancashire residents, and Watford providing food and refuge for staff at the neighbouring hospital. But it is also impossible to avoid the conclusion that at some level above this sport hangs a foul and corrosive fog.\nThe Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund\u2019s attempt to buy Newcastle United is the latest kick in English football\u2019s moral goolies, an ordeal the sport has repeatedly submitted itself with apparent alacrity but of which one can only hope it will one day tire.\nNewcastle\u2019s potential sale brought protests from Amnesty International, protests about Amnesty International from the portion of Newcastle fans who have already decided that getting rid of Mike Ashley is worth the occasional mass execution, and an angry letter from Yousef al-Obaidly, chief executive of the Doha-based broadcaster beIN Sports, telling the Premier League and its constituent clubs that \u201cthe industrial-scale theft of the Premier League\u2019s intellectual property by Saudi Arabia\u201d \u2013 in the shape of state-endorsed unofficial match broadcasts \u2013 \u201cis, sadly, now notorious\u201d. Obaidly, who also sits on the board of directors at Paris Saint-Germain, was last in the news in 2019, when he was reported to be under judicial investigation in France for \u201caggravated money laundering\u201d, related to Doha\u2019s bid for the World Athletics Championships. He \u201ccompletely and categorically denied\u201d the allegations.\nMeanwhile, though wage deferrals have been agreed at several top-flight clubs, Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil reportedly refuses to take a demure trim to his \u00a3350,000-a-week salary. \u201cDeferral is an option but not to agree a cut today when the club may still make the same profit as last year,\u201d his agent, Erkut S\u00f6g\u00fct, insisted this month\u2013 the pre-tax profit Arsenal made last season being, in fact, a \u00a332m loss (of which \u00d6zil\u2019s salary would account for 57%).\nThe government was rightly criticised during this crisis for suggesting that footballers should give up some of their salaries while remaining silent, for example, on the hedge fund managers whose donations largely funded their own election campaigns. But it is jarring that the PFA has recommended players in the Championship accept no more than a 25% wage deferral, when their clubs reported pre-tax losses of \u00a3307m in 2017-18 \u2013 the last season for which every team\u2019s accounts are available \u2013 and spending on wages in the decade from 2008-18 increased from \u00a3291m to \u00a3795m while across the country salaries have slipped from an average of \u00a3473 a week to \u00a3468.\nThere seems no obvious remedy for a sport that has simultaneously not enough money and way too much; in which elite players are so used to getting three cherries in life\u2019s fruit machine that any spin without a jackpot payout is incomprehensible; beyond the kind of wholehearted wealth redistribution that would, among other consequences, very swiftly have Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund seeking alternative methods of reputation management. For now, though, we can only watch in horror at a situation akin to a wedding disco from which all the music and all the lithe, young bodies have disappeared, leaving the awkward, ugly movements of those usually glimpsed only on the edge of the dancefloor. The hope from here is that we don\u2019t take too many elbows in the face before someone gets the music going again.",

What better time to seek out his best work online...\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nIt\u2019s been a quiet few months for Apple TV+ since the glossy hype of its launch last November, but we got a taste of their promised hipper side this week. On Friday, the streaming platform premiered Beastie Boys Story, a new documentary by Spike Jonze on the tongue-in-cheek white rappers whose early-90s prominence he facilitated with some memorably anarchic music videos.\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nMostly narrated to camera by surviving Beastie Boys Adam Horovitz and Mike Diamond in a stripped-down \u201clive documentary\u201d format, it\u2019s a Generation X nostalgia trip that can be described with adjectives you\u2019d never have applied to the group in their prime: mellow, reflective, affectionate, and a bit melancholic, as it tracks their career path from brash satirists to hard-partying sellouts to legacy artists. It\u2019s a treat for Beastie Boys fans and Spike Jonze completists alike: I suspect there\u2019s substantial overlap in that Venn diagram.\nJonze is a film-maker unusually well suited to a home-curated streaming retrospective, even if his career started well before video-sharing platforms were a glint in the internet\u2019s eye. Many directors progress from making ads to music videos to films without looking back, but Jonze\u2019s mixed-media oeuvre has remained dependent on all these formats for its cachet. You can\u2019t ignore any size of screen in appreciating his inventiveness and influence.\nHis four feature films are the obvious place to start. Being John Malkovich (1999) remains a breathtakingly strange and conceptually elastic debut, blending philosophy and flip absurdism with almost obnoxious ease. Jonze doubled down with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman on Adaptation (2002), a hilarious unpicking of the artist\u2019s imagination. Never quite given the credit it deserved, Jonze\u2019s exquisite 2009 adaptation of Maurice Sendak\u2019s Where the Wild Things Are trickily honoured existing iconography while adding fresh nuances of meaning and feeling. Her, which justly won him a screenplay Oscar in 2014, was a forward-thinking man-machine romance that looks all the more prescient in times of self-isolation. All are readily available on iTunes and Amazon, and generously reward repeat visits, but they only tell half the story of their director\u2019s career.\nThe rest is to be found by digging through YouTube, Vimeo and other free platforms, where his dizzy array of shorts, commercials and music videos are to be found, albeit often in variable quality. Of the videos, some are iconic, imprinted on their era: the swirling, makeshift mini-musical he choreographed for Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s It\u2019s Oh So Quiet; the snappy surprise factor of Christopher Walken\u2019s dance moves in Fatboy Slim\u2019s Weapon of Choice; the surreal dog-human odyssey of Daft Punk\u2019s Da Funk; and of course the chaotic crime-procedural parody he constructed for the Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage. My favourite is slightly less ubiquitous: his propulsively cinematic but oddly mournful clip for the Chemical Brothers\u2019 Elektrobank, starring his then-wife Sofia Coppola as a star gymnast. It\u2019s remarkable how brightly and wittily they hold up today.\nJonze\u2019s ads offer similarly concentrated rewards, and commercial production company MJZ has a dedicated page showcasing some of his best. They include The New Perfume, an infectious four-minute dance freakout for Kenzo that rather nicely complements the aforementioned Walken video; his fluorescent, FKA twigs-starring Welcome Home ad for Apple; and Lamp, a short, deadpan Ikea ad that brusquely and brilliantly sends up the manipulative mechanics of the medium.\nOver at the reliably slick, user-friendly Short of the Week site, meanwhile, a few Jonze curiosities are freely available to stream. I\u2019m Here is a wistful half-hour robot romance sweetly inspired by Shel Silverstein\u2019s children\u2019s classic The Giving Tree; Mourir aupr\u00e8s de toi, a beguiling, rustically animated bookshop fantasy; two music-related spinoffs are the Arcade Fire-attached, adolescent\u2019s-eye short Scenes from the Suburbs and the morbid, woozy waking nightmare of Kanye West in We Were Once a Fairytale. And that\u2019s before you get to Jonze\u2019s recent direction of Aziz Ansari\u2019s Right Now comedy special on Netflix, or indeed his involvement as writer and producer of the four Jackass films thus far, all available to stream on Now TV. With such a restless, oddball career to work from, your own Jonze marathon can be as classy or crude as you like.\nBacurau (Mubi, 18) \n If you missed it in cinemas or on its limited Mubi streaming run, catch up with Brazilian auteur Kleber Mendonca Filho\u2019s exhilaratingly eccentric, bloody blend of exploitation thriller, sci-fi and fierce anti-colonial allegory on DVD or VOD.\nThe Gentlemen (Entertainment, 18) \n Guy Ritchie\u2019s all-star return to British gangland territory will please whatever die-hard fans he has left, but there are icky strains of casual racism and capitalist defensiveness amid the familiar banter. Great suits, though.\nCalm With Horses (Altitude, 15) \n Nick Rowland\u2019s impressive debut feature strikes arresting notes of brute poetry in stormily downbeat surroundings. Cosmo Jarvis\u2019s performance as an ex-boxer snared in rural Ireland\u2019s criminal underbelly adds an extra jolt of electricity.\nS\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) \n If you\u2019ve always meant to watch B\u00e9la Tarr\u2019s demanding but darkly immersive 450-minute plunge into post-communist Hungary \u2013 now reissued on Bluray in all its granite handsomeness \u2013 when better than in quarantine?",

        "content": "Trust is essential in the pandemic and scientists here can set the priorities that make the most sense for our people\nResearch to find a cure and effective treatment for Covid-19 is well under way, with hundreds of trials already announced. But very few involve African researchers, and this is a mistake.\nAlthough Africa has yet to feel the full force of the coronavirus, preventing severe cases is a higher priority than it is elsewhere. Africa needs research that is tailored to our reality.\nEven hospitals in New York are overwhelmed; hospitals in many African countries barely have enough ventilators to fill one room. So research needs to be directed towards preventing hospitalisations, potentially though treatment of mild cases as early as possible.\nIf research is not conducted in Africa, potential life-saving innovations will be delayed, not least because regulatory authorities in Africa will require local data on Covid-19 patients to register any new drug.\nLocal researchers are also more likely to maintain the trust of the population. Outrageous comments made recently by two French researchers about using Africa as a testing ground for vaccines have sparked fury throughout the continent. The indignation is understandable: just because there is a health crisis does not mean research ethics can be violated.\nSuch careless talk threatens to undermine years of work by African scientists to gain trust among people.\nI am an infectious diseases researcher in Nairobi and a medical doctor. I have dedicated my career to developing better treatments for kala-azar, the \u201cblack fever\u201d, a deadly parasitic illness that affects the most vulnerable people across eastern Africa. Too many patients \u2013 especially children \u2013 die because of the lack of effective tests and treatments for this disease.\nI see doctors on the news in New York and Milan telling their harrowing experiences of battling for patients with Covid-19 in the absence of a cure. As it knocks on our doors, I see their helplessness as a mirror of my own: when the treatment you need to save a life simply does not exist.\nI believe that our response to Covid-19 can be informed by our experience with kala-azar research.\nTo find an effective treatment, I have travelled to the remotest areas of Kenya to sit with local leaders and gain their trust \u2013 explaining why clinical trials are vital to their communities. They have welcomed us as African researchers. As the Covid-19 threat looms, I feel this goodwill is at risk.\nIn 2003, scientists, doctors and ministries of health from Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and, eventually, Uganda, decided that we needed to set our own research priorities for kala-azar. Collectively, we ran large multi-country clinical trials to improve the toxic, ineffective, burdensome treatment options for kala-azar at the time.\nIt was not easy \u2013 clinical sites were in areas marked by conflict and extreme poverty. But we endured, bringing clinical trial sites up to international standards, and together delivered an effective, shorter-course treatment that is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nWe need to now come together in the same spirit to develop adapted solutions for Covid-19 in Africa.\nThe Solidarity trial being run by the WHO has begun to include African countries, which is a good sign. A recently launched Clinical Research Coalition for Covid-19 is another important move, bringing together governments and research institutions to accelerate research in low- and middle-income countries.\nWith kala-azar research, African countries showed that we could run high-quality clinical trials by working together, along with our international partners. This was research for Africans, by Africans. There are other examples: the Democratic Republic of the Congo led research, along with neighbouring countries, for the first all-oral treatment for sleeping sickness. Against all odds, Congolese researchers brought world-class clinical research to the most remote areas of the country.\nAfrican-led clinical research can help us continue to build trust and confidence within our communities by showing them that our scientists are setting the priorities that make the most sense for our people.\nWe must continue to work together and take control of our own research agenda. This is the best way to support our fellow African doctors, who have been on the frontline of so many disease outbreaks in the past and will be again very soon.\n Dr Monique Wasunna is director of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative\u2019s Africa regional office",

She dismissed criticism that risk assessments should already have been conducted on people who have been at the clinic over the past month.\n\u201cWe are making risk assessments across all of the staff and the patients in the facility and all of them will be contacted at a time that is appropriate once we have the information to undertake that risk assessment,\u201d she said.\nThe number of people who have died in Australia after testing positive to Covid-19 has climbed to 80, after the death of a 90-year-old man at Mersey Community hospital in Devonport, Tasmania.\nNew South Wales saw its highest number of new cases in several days, with 12 new cases including four at the Newmarch House aged care home, where five people have died.\nAnnouncing the increase, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he was disappointed to see that crowds had flocked to the Sydney beaches when they were briefly reopened on Friday.\n\u201cI have to express a degree of disappointment and agitation about the fact that some people, when the rules are relaxed, when we try and do the right thing by giving people the opportunity to have some outside exercise, [they] are disregarding the very strong message of social distancing,\u201d Hazzard said.\nVictoria recorded three new positive cases, including one inpatient at the Albert Road Clinic, and Tasmania recorded two new cases, both in the north-west. Western Australia and the ACT both recorded one new case each.\nThe Qantas flight from Buenos Aires will leave on Saturday afternoon, local time, and arrive in Melbourne at 7.30pm on Sunday. Two other government-supported commercial flights will leave Australia the same day bound for Thailand and Pakistan, carrying residents of those countries home.\nBrett Hackett, the Australian ambassador to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, said the embassy in Buenos Aries had to cancel its Anzac Day celebrations because of Argentina\u2019s lockdown, \u201cbut I reckon helping Australians and New Zealanders return home on the 25th of April is just as good if not better\u201d.\nMany Australians and New Zealanders commemorated Anzac Day by lighting a candle at their driveway as memorials remained closed due to social distancing rules. A small group, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, attended a dawn service at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Among those present was Stokes, who is the chairman of the Australian War Memorial Council, and his wife, Christine.\nThe couple returned from the US on their private jet earlier this month and received an exemption on medical grounds to the requirement to undergo a mandatory hotel quarantine, instead seeing out the 14-day quarantine in their Perth mansion. That quarantine ended on Wednesday.\nAsked if they planned to seek another exemption from mandatory hotel quarantine if they returned to WA while the hard domestic border remained in place, a spokesman for Stokes said the couple planned to go to their home in Sydney. There are no domestic travel restrictions on entering NSW or the ACT from other states.",

        "content": "Longstanding health and socio-economic disparities have made minorities more vulnerable to Covid-19\nFor the first weeks of the pandemic in St Louis, Missouri, the only ones to die from the virus were black.\nBy 8 April the coronavirus had killed 12 people. Each and every one was African American.\nIn this midwestern city that six years ago became the focal point for a national debate on race and policing after an unarmed African American teenager, Michael Brown, was killed by police in the suburb of Ferguson, the racial disparity attached to the Covid-19 death toll held a particular resonance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education system issue, it\u2019s a health and resources system issue and it\u2019s a public transportation issue,\u201d said Cedric \u201cC-sharp\u201d Redmon, a local rap artist and youth ambassador for the city of St Louis who is part of the city\u2019s outreach efforts, as he attempted to pinpoint the root causes of the disproportionate death toll. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that would need to be rectified in order to stop something like this again.\u201d\nThe death toll in St Louis now stands at 21, with 64% of all Covid-19 cases in the city being African American. They make up only 45% of the population.\nAlthough a nationwide statistical picture is nowhere near complete, St Louis is far from an anecdotal outlier. Major US cities including Chicago, New York and New Orleans report similar racial disparities in the thousands of lives now claimed by Covid-19. In 2014, Brown\u2019s death split the United States between those ready to recognise the entrenched racism that underpinned the black community\u2019s experience with law enforcement, and those unwilling to do so.\nIn 2020, Covid-19 has begun to divide the country between those ready to explore the structural racism ingrained in America\u2019s public health outcomes, and those who are not.\nEarlier in the month, Donald Trump described evidence of the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on black communities as \u201cterrible\u201d and a \u201ctremendous challenge\u201d, but the president has done little to respond to it since.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the administration\u2019s leading public health agency, has begun to publish more detailed data on the racial breakdown of confirmed coronavirus cases. But of the 828,441 confirmed cases documented, only 36% are broken down by race, largely due to many states and municipalities not recording racial data on those who test positive. According to the Associated Press, the CDC has offered little pathway to assist local governments to better record this information.\nIn a marker of the pressing need to address this glaring hole in the national picture, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation last week to compel US government health officials to publish daily data on the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths broken down by race.\n\u201cBecause of government-sponsored discrimination and systemic racism, communities of color are on the frontlines of this pandemic,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the bill\u2019s backers, said in a statement. \u201cTo effectively slow the spread of the virus and ensure our response is robust and equitable, we need comprehensive national data on who is getting infected, who is getting treatment, and who is dying.\u201d\nKey aspects of the bill were passed as part of the latest coronavirus relief package on Friday. There are currently no Republican co-sponsors of the full legislation in the house.\nAs with much of the scattergun approach to the pandemic in the US, the Trump administration has largely left the states to administer their own responses to racial disparities.\nIn Michigan, one of the first states to create a racial disparity Covid-19 taskforce, the lieutenant governor, Garlin Gilchrist, told the Guardian that Trump \u201cis simply not taking strong enough action\u201d to address the disparities.\nThe state began monitoring racial outcomes early in the pandemic. Over 2,900 people have now died in Michigan, with African Americans constituting 40% of the death toll, but only 14% of the population. Gilchrist, a Democrat, personally knows 15 people who have died from Covid-19 \u2013 all but two are black.\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s very real for communities. I live in Detroit and part of the reason that communities of color are so anxious is because typically, when something so frightening is happening we come together to cope with it as a community. And this virus has made the act of coming together, dangerous and deadly.\u201d\nThe taskforce will involve public health experts, labor organizers and politicians to examine a suite of issues believed to contribute to the disparity, from air pollution in minority neighbourhoods, less availability of testing, and the root causes of other underlying health issues, with an aim to push both real time solutions as well as longer-term legislative action.\nNumerous experts have pointed out how longstanding health and socio-economic disparities have made minorities more vulnerable to the worst consequences of infection along almost every point of the microbe\u2019s path.\n\u201cIf you look at the health conditions that we know dramatically increase the risk of death if you\u2019re infected with Sars Covid-2, African Americans have much higher prevalence of every one of those conditions. Diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, you name it, African Americans have a higher prevalence,\u201d explained Thomas LaVeist, dean and professor at Tulane\u2019s school of public health and tropical medicine.\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a tragedy like this, or some sort of a major disaster occurs, it\u2019s going to be the least advantaged people who are going to be most harmed by it,\u201d he said.\nAfrican Americans and Latinos are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to be forced to take public transportation, increasing their risk of exposure to coronavirus. Minority and low-income communities are more likely to experience food insecurity, which is linked to higher rates of obesity and diabetes, and less able to stockpile supplies.\nDecades of segregation, discriminatory housing policies and poor environmental protections have left many African Americans living in substandard and high-density housing (where social distancing is that much harder) or areas of higher air pollution, leading to higher rates of asthma and other diseases.\nRacial and ethnic minorities of all education levels report they are typically less able than whites to handle financial setbacks. Black- and Hispanic-owned small businesses have less access to traditional financial lenders, making it more difficult or impossible to access coronavirus relief programs like the now drained $350bn paycheck protection program.\n\u201cWe need to understand that people\u2019s health is not a direct result of their behaviors and actions,\u201d said Dr Lisa Cooper, a Bloomberg distinguished professor and director of the center for health equity at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cPeople\u2019s individual actions and behaviors do play a role in health. But the environments in which they exist and the policies that we put in place that shape people\u2019s opportunities actually determine what choices they have to make.\u201d\nOnly two states \u2013 Kansas and Illinois \u2013 are tracking racial and ethnic information on coronavirus testing, according to Johns Hopkins University. But city-level data has begun to reveal disparities in testing.\nAn analysis last week by the New York Post found that 22 of the 30 most-tested zip codes in New York City, the center of the national outbreak, are whiter or wealthier (or both) than the city\u2019s average demographic profile.\nIn Philadelphia, those living in higher-income zip codes have been tested at a rate six times greater than those in poor areas, according to an analysis by the Drexel University epidemiologist Usama Bilal.\nRubix Life Sciences, a Massachusetts-based biotech company, recently released a report that found African Americans who reported common coronavirus symptoms were less likely to get a test. The study used patient survey and hospital billing data from seven states in February and March.\nReginald Swift, CEO of the company, also said he expects to see racial disparities in access to clinical trials for experimental Covid-19 drugs.\nHe claims trials in some cases have limited the drugs to patients without underlying illnesses, leaving out a large proportion of Covid-struck African Americans. There are also health insurance issues, where many low-cost insurance plans refuse to cover costly experimental trials.\n\u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s the elephant in the room,\u201d he said.\nResearch from the last decade has also shown minorities are more likely to live in \u201chealthcare deserts\u201d. One study found black Americans were on average nearly 70% more likely to live in a zip code with a shortage of primary care physicians. African Americans in some major US cities are also more likely to live in an area with no hospital trauma center within five miles.\nRacial discrimination in the world of medicine has a particularly gruesome history in America, stretching back to the gynecological experiments of J Marion Sims on enslaved women in the 1840s, to the infamous Tuskegee experiment and the case of Henrietta Lacks.\nCooper worried that the unprecedented stress on the healthcare system during the coronavirus crisis could exacerbate existing biases among already overloaded hospital staff.\n\u201cWe know that those biases tend to be increased at a time when there\u2019s a lot of stress on people,\u201d she said.\nUltimately, Cooper said, the actions we take today will leave a lasting legacy in the future.\n\u201cWhat will people say about us?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid we think about everyone when we were trying to address this problem? Did we want to make a better life or a better country for everyone? Or do we just decide that certain groups of people didn\u2019t matter as much?\u201d\nSophie Kasakove and Lauren Gambino contributed reporting",

The driver of the Porsche has been charged with dangerous driving and failing to render assistance after a crash, among other things, and has not applied for bail.\nHumphris\u2019 partner, Todd Robinson, addressed the media on Friday, saying he wanted to \u201clet everybody know he wore a uniform, but he was a person under that uniform. He came home to someone.\u201d\nPrestney\u2019s parents, Andrew and Belinda, and brother, Alex, said Prestney was their \u201cbright light,\u201d a \u201ccreative, insightful, loving and genuine soul\u201d who loved music and was a passionate AFL supporter.\nHe followed his brother in joining the police and had only been in the job five months.

        "content": "People reminded to stay at home as calls grow for easing of coronavirus restrictions\nThe public has been urged to stay at home, as forecasters predict warm and sunny weather across most of the country for the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown.\nThe long spell of high temperatures is prompting concerns that people may defy lockdown rules, which came into force on 23 March.\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, has not ruled out granting police additional powers to enforce lockdown measures, the Daily Express reported.\nShe is expected to reinforce the message to stay at home at Saturday\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing.\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urged people on Friday to continue to adhere to the restrictions despite some encouraging signs that the coronavirus crisis is beginning to ease.\n\u201cThe country has done incredibly well in adhering to social distancing and there is a danger as we go into yet another warm sunny weekend that people think that perhaps these graphs are showing that the peak is over,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t over. We\u2019re riding perhaps, we hope, a downward trend but it is by no means, no means established yet.\u201d\nPhilip Hammond, however, called on the government to begin easing the lockdown and restart the economy.\n\u201cThe reality is that we have to start reopening the economy. But we have to do it living with Covid,\u201d the former chancellor told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait until a vaccine is developed, produced in sufficient quantity and rolled out across the population. The economy won\u2019t survive that long,\u201d he said.\nNew data suggests the onset of lockdown fatigue in Britain. The use of transport increased by between 2% and 3% over the past week.\nThe public has been instructed to stay at home, but the restrictions allow daily outdoor exercise and essential journeys for supplies and work.\nGovernment figures published on Wednesday also showed UK vehicle traffic levels at their highest since the lockdown began.\nCalls for the government to announce details of an exit strategy have intensified over the past week, and Shapps said any easing of restrictions would depend to some extent on people\u2019s behaviour.\n\u201cWhen people ask me, when will the measures, the social distancing, the stay-at-home measures, be altered, my answer in some ways is that some of this lies in your own hands,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe more we adhere to it and are strict about the social distancing that is required, the faster that decision will be able to be made.\u201d\nA police and crime commissioner had previously said \u201cisolation fatigue\u201d could set in and pose a genuine threat to the lockdown, predicting that public frustration would increase after Easter.\nThe London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said in a BBC interview on Friday that \u201cthe exemplary behaviour of a vast majority of Londoners\u201d who were following physical distancing guidelines had caused a 90% drop in Transport for London fares, which means a quarter of TfL staff will need to be furloughed from Monday.",

        "content": "The coronavirus was probably brought to Brazil by rich returning holidaymakers but it is threatening to explode in marginal communities\nIn many ways, Washington Castro was a typical resident of Rocinha, the immense redbrick favela that towers over Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Atlantic coast.\nIndustrious, God-fearing and the offspring of migrants from Brazil\u2019s parched and impoverished north-east, he supported two young children by working two separate jobs and wore a suit and tie when attending his local church.\n\u201cHe was a marvellous boy. He worked Monday to Monday,\u201d his grief-stricken father, Jos\u00e9 Osmar Alves da Silva, remembered as he reflected on his son\u2019s death. \u201cNow there\u2019s this hole inside of me and I just can\u2019t make sense of anything.\u201d\nCastro died of suspected Covid-19 last Saturday at age 27 \u2013 one of at least six Rocinha residents to lose their lives to the coronavirus as it begins what many fear could be a devastating march through some of Latin America\u2019s most vulnerable communities.\n\u201cHe was a cutie \u2026 Whenever we met he was always wearing the same smile,\u201d said Cec\u00edlia Vasconcelos, a childhood friend who grew up with him in this sprawling hillside community of some 100,000 residents in southern Rio.\nThe coronavirus appears to have been brought into Brazil by members of the country\u2019s middle and upper classes as they returned from February holidays in Europe or the United States.\nIn Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, many of the early infections were concentrated in the richest neighbourhoods, such as Copacabana and G\u00e1vea, where Castro had worked as an assistant at an accountancy firm and a poolside waiter at a club for Brazil\u2019s wealthy elites.\nOne of the most famous clusters was Rio\u2019s Country Club, an ultra-exclusive enclave of privilege and power just three miles from Rocinha where at least 60 of the 850 members were infected.\nBut two months after Brazil\u2019s first reported Covid-19 case the disease is making headway in the deprived, densely populated favelas of both cities, with potentially far-reaching political and humanitarian consequences.\n\u201cYou can see that it\u2019s moving towards the urban peripheries \u2013 gradually, but it\u2019s getting there,\u201d said Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, warning that its proliferation in such places could exact a terrible human toll on residents lacking access to private healthcare or sometimes even basic sanitation.\n\u201cI tend to believe that in some places we\u2019re going to see something on the scale of Ecuador,\u201d where hospitals have been overwhelmed and bodies dumped in the streets, Lotufo warned.\nPedro Doria, a Rio-based writer, said he believed coronavirus\u2019s spread through the favelas could also carry a heavy political price for Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has called for containment measures to be relaxed in an apparent attempt to ingratiate himself with the poor.\n\u201cRight now what is hurting people [in the favelas] is the economy. So right now Bolsonaro is making a lot of sense to them,\u201d Doria said. But he thought attitudes would change \u201cthe moment people we love start dying around us\u201d.\n\u201cDepending on how the pandemic goes \u2013 especially in the the urban peripheries and the favelas \u2013 Bolsonaro will lose a lot of his support,\u201d Doria predicted, speculating that it could even end his presidency through impeachment.\n\u201cPeople will not forget that he said it was OK to go out on the streets.\u201d\nSo far at least 18 people have reportedly lost their lives to Covid-19 in Rio\u2019s favelas, which house about 20% of the city\u2019s 6.7 million residents.\nAt least 140 cases have been detected, 54 in Rocinha, which is one of the communities closest to the city\u2019s affluent south zone.\nOther deaths have taken place in some of Rio\u2019s most deprived areas including Acari, Manguinhos and the City of God favela made famous by Fernando Meirelles\u2019s film.\nWallace Pereira, a community leader in Rocinha, said he feared a lack of testing meant the true numbers were in fact far higher.\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a public disaster here,\u201d he said, warning that the political skirmish between Rio\u2019s governor, who has ordered residents to stay at home, and Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the pandemic, was leaving favela residents confused and exposed.\n\u201cPeople are getting sick and they have nowhere to go,\u201d Pereira said. \u201cThe situation is getting worse because many people are going around saying: \u2018This virus won\u2019t get me\u2019 \u2013 which is a fantasy.\u201d\nAcross town in the portside Morro da Provid\u00eancia, Rio\u2019s oldest favela, Maur\u00edcio Rodrigues de Oliveira, 64, was found dead last Tuesday by neighbours who suspect Covid-19 was the cause.\n\u201cThe day before he complained of a temperature and fainted in the street,\u201d said Ladelson Soares, a 41-year-old neighbour.\n\u201cHe was a wonderful person \u2013 a waiter in some of Rio\u2019s most famous restaurants,\u201d said Soares, who claimed authorities had taken two days to collect his corpse.\nThe death has left many neighbours \u2013 already struggling with the economic impact of lockdown \u2013 in panic.\n\u201cToday I got some money together to buy hand sanitiser because I\u2019ve got two kids at home. But I know that means we won\u2019t have the money to eat,\u201d said Claudene Carvalho, an unemployed local who found his body and has been begging community leaders for help.\nFor Castro\u2019s family the tragedy began on the morning of 6 April when he set off for work on the number 539 bus.\nShortly after reaching the office Castro began feeling ill and went to a nearby public health clinic where he was admitted complaining of a headache and breathing difficulties.\nBy then, Covid-19 had already killed more than 500 Brazilians. On Friday the death toll hit 3,670. But \u2013 apparently relaxed about his situation \u2013 Castro sent his dad a WhatsApp photo in which he appeared wearing an oxygen mask. Nobody imagined what was to come.\nTwo days later Castro was rushed to a hospital for Covid-19 patients in western Rio where he was intubated on arrival. \u201cWe\u2019d go there \u2013 but we couldn\u2019t see him,\u201d his 56-year-old father remembered. \u201cWe only talked to the doctors.\u201d\nAfter 10 days in intensive care \u2013 and, for relatives, 10 days of prayer \u2013 Castro was declared dead about 4.30am on 18 April, the death certificate listing severe acute respiratory syndrome as the official cause of death. He left two children, Maria Clara and Pierre, aged three and seven.\nNot far from Castro\u2019s former home in Rocinha, another family is also in mourning.\nAnt\u00f4nio Edson Mariano, a 67-year-old street vendor who sold biscuits on the beach, died on 30 March \u2013 three days after first complaining of a stomach ache \u2013 and was the first of the favela\u2019s residents killed by the coronavirus.\nOn the day of his cremation, Mariano\u2019s wife, Maria L\u00facia Moreira Mariano, was herself taken to hospital, where she was given the same diagnosis and informed of her partner\u2019s death.\nBut as she fights for her own life, Maria has yet to be told of another fatality. One day after her admittance, the couple\u2019s 45-year-old son, Alexandre, also lost his life to Covid-19.",

        "content": "Vocal influencers such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and the Heartland Institute are hitting back at a time when people\u2019s trust in science is rising\nFringe climate science deniers who spread online disinformation are now downplaying the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new analysis.\nDeSmog, a blog and organization that tracks the culprits behind false information about the climate crisis, identified about 70 individuals and groups questioning the deadliness of the coronavirus and pushing for an end to social distancing, along with protesters who have been encouraged by Donald Trump.\nFrom the conservative conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to the US-based Heartland Institute and UK-based James Delingpole, the review concludes that the same influencers trying to make the public question the severity of global heating are also discounting the science surrounding Covid-19.\n\u201cThe climate war has largely been about confusing the public and making people trust in science and government less,\u201d said DeSmog\u2019s executive director, Brendan DeMelle. \u201cAnd here we are in a pandemic where science and global cooperation are critical, and that\u2019s a threat to the ideology of a lot of these \u2026 organizations.\n\u201cYou end up with this conspiracy theory about big government taking over our lives, taking away our freedoms, subjecting us to stay-at-home orders that we have to liberate ourselves from,\u201d DeMelle said.\nDeSmog also identified fossil fuel and chemical industry aligned interests touting single-use plastics in personal protective gear, food packaging and grocery bags.\nJohn Cook, who studies climate denial at the center for climate change communication at George Mason University, said he expected the overlap but was surprised by the extent of the parallels.\n\u201cPeople who are politically conservative and who value individual rights over collective responsibility are less supporting of social distancing policies and also just have a lower understanding of the dangers of Covid-19,\u201d Cook said, citing emerging polling data.\nCook outlines five techniques of science denial that people should watch for, including the cherry-picking of data.\n\u201cThe latest argument that we should relax social distancing because the curve [of cases] is flattening is very much an example of cherry-picking,\u201d Cook said.\nIn the US, some of the same groups that have petitioned the Trump administration to debate human-caused climate disruption and to roll back climate standards are sowing distrust of epidemiological research.\nJay Lehr, the former science director of the Heartland Institute who now works for the Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition, on 30 March said people have been \u201cbarraged on the 24/7 news cycle for years\u201d about climate change and now \u201cface a more realistic fear of the most contagious virus any of us have ever experienced\u201d but \u201cboth, however, suffer from questionable statistics and predictions that make us wonder what is real and what is someone\u2019s best guess\u201d.\nHeartland\u2019s communications director, Jim Lakely, in a podcast about the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d on 15 March compared the virus to a bad flu season and said that while \u201cthe panic is definitely more dangerous than the flu \u2013 this has to be put in perspective.\n\u201cWe have to think about the economic damage this is doing to the country. This is incalculable,\u201d Lakely said.\nThe Heartland Institute also posted a piece by economics professor Daniel Sutter arguing that alternative strategies to social distancing \u2013 like sheltering vulnerable populations \u2013 \u201ccould have mitigated the human toll at a significantly lower economic and social cost\u201d.\nThe Manhattan Institute, which calls itself a free-market thinktank, ran an article from Heather MacDonald in which she wrote: \u201cEven if my odds of dying from coronavirus should suddenly jump ten-thousand-fold, from the current rate of 0.000012 percent across the U.S. population all the way up to 0.12 percent, I\u2019d happily take those odds over the destruction being wrought on the U.S. and global economy from this unbridled panic.\u201d\nThe Media Research Center in a video said: \u201cThis is exactly how they incite mass panic: through lies and deception and exploiting ignorance. It\u2019s how they convince people that we\u2019re all going to die because Trump doesn\u2019t believe in science or something.\u201d\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who founded Infowars, has called the virus a \u201choax\u201d and appeared at a \u201cYou Can\u2019t Close America\u201d rally in Austin on Saturday, where he shook hands with unmasked supporters.\nFossil fuel supporters have also capitalized on the pandemic to warn of the costs of climate action.\nAlex Epstein, the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress which DeSmog cites as associated with various groups connected to the rightwing billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, called the current recession a \u201cmild preview of the Green New Deal\u201d, and said that \u201cour biggest ally in the fight against coronavirus is the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\nThe links between climate science denial and Covid-19 downplaying reach outside the US. In the UK, Delingpole, a rightwing commentator, has reposted calls to rapidly return to regular life.\nIn a recent podcast, he called doubters of quarantining measures \u201clockdown skeptics\u201d, and referred to those who support social distancing as \u201chysterical bedwetters\u201d. He accused the media of promoting panic in \u201chysterical tabloids\u201d.",

        "content": "Former England winger\u2019s marathon is on hold but she is still raising money for the Derby Rimmer MND Foundation\nInstead of standing alongside thousands of others to take part in the London Marathon on behalf of the Derby Rimmer MND Foundation, on Sunday the former England winger Karen Carney will be doing her bit at home to help cover the \u00a34bn shortfall charities are facing as a result of the cancellation of sporting events across the UK.\nFor Carney there is a \u201csilver lining\u201d to the race\u2019s postponement until 4 October: the chance to build up \u201cmore momentum and have a little bit more of a push to get some recognition out there for the cause\u201d.\nCarney\u2019s cause is that of Stephen Darby, the husband of her former England teammate Steph Houghton. Since Darby retired from football after his diagnosis with motor neurone disease in 2018, the former Liverpool, Bradford and Bolton player has united with the British Forces veteran Chris Rimmer, a close friend who also has the disease, to launch the Darby Rimmer MND Foundation to raise awareness and fund research into the condition.\nRunning the marathon for the foundation was a \u201cno brainer\u201d for Carney, but it was her mum who gave the push she needed to take on the challenge. \u201cI did the half marathon in October last year just to keep me ticking over when I retired and to give me something to focus on,\u201d Carney says. \u201cI crossed the finish line and my mum said to me: \u2018Well done, but you know what you\u2019ve got to do now, you\u2019ve got to do the marathon and you\u2019ve got to do it for Steph and Stephen.\u2019\u201d\nCarney had been talking in the BT Sport studio with Stephen Warnock, a friend of Darby, about a way they could do their bit, and her mum\u2019s words provided the answer. So Carney and Warnock signed up to run together.\n\u201cObviously I know Steph well, and I know her husband through seeing him after games,\u201d Carney says. \u201cI just wanted to show my support for Steph. I have seen how it has affected her and she\u2019s been amazing this whole time. And more importantly I want to help him as well because this is a disease which has no cure; I think life expectancy is between one and five years. It\u2019s devastating illness and I don\u2019t think people know enough about it.\u201d\nCoronavirus may have delayed the marathon, but Carney will be doing toe taps with a football on Sunday instead as part of the 2.6 Challenge which is raising money for Save the UK\u2019s Charities by asking people to come up with an activity to take part in on what would have been the 40th edition of the London Marathon - for example, by running or walking 2.6 miles, or for 26 minutes, juggling for 2.6 minutes, or bringing together 26 people on a video call.\nCarney has relaxed the intensity of her marathon preparations but it has provided her with some important support during lockdown. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of doing half marathon stuff and once we\u2019re hopefully out of lockdown I\u2019ll start to build my training up again. I think it\u2019s really important to keep running for mental health in this lockdown and it\u2019s really helped me \u2013 it\u2019s given me structure.\u201d\nThe strength shown by Houghton, Darby and Rimmer has also helped her drive through the ups and downs of training.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Steph for years and years. I wouldn\u2019t say like we\u2019re besties or anything like that, but I think the world of her. The one word sums up Steph is \u2018class\u2019. How she conducts herself, she\u2019s always positive, never moans, she\u2019s a captain for her football club, captain for our country, her performances continue to be outstanding, her performances at the World Cup were first class. She\u2019s an absolute role model to everyone, including myself.\n\u201cI have struggled at times when I\u2019ve been training for this marathon. It\u2019s been challenging trying to run 20 miles and juggle personal and professional life as well. It\u2019s difficult but when the times get hard on those runs I think of Steph, Stephen and Chris and the a bigger picture. To help them and their families is a big honour for me.\u201d",

        "content": "Remember football \u2013 the crowds, the noise, the goofy beaver dancing on the touchline? Welcome to the weird world of the matchday mascot\nThere is no force in the universe more irresistible than a high five from Reading FC\u2019s lion mascot, Kingsley. The only thing that comes close is a hug from Kingsley\u2019s mascot wife, Queensley. Do not ask why a mascot needs a mascot wife, because I cannot explain that in any meaningful way. Mascots intersect society at the exact same angle as cereal box characters: we never question why they are there, what they mean, or why they never blink; but we do demand complicated backstories for them, and extended family trees.\nBefore all this happened \u2013 before the lockdown and the boarded-up pubs, and the groups of no more than two, and the two-metre distancing and the isolation and the ransacked supermarkets, and most crucially the suspension of every single sport on the planet, all at once \u2013 I became obsessed with mascots. There they were: jiggling, expressionless monoliths made of felt, pacing up and down the touchline, a seen-but-unseen aspect of modern sport, ever-present and never questioned. In the current void, you could be forgiven for forgetting all about them; but they are just as crucial to the matchday experience as the people kicking the ball, and the other people running after it, as crucial as being one 60,000-throated voice, shouting them all on, as crucial as the pies and the scarves and the long winding walk to the stadium, the urinal queues and the matchday programmes. And there, look: there\u2019s a person in a bumblebee outfit, waving at you. Who are they? What are they for?\nOn a wet weekend before lockdown, I went walking through the labyrinthine corridors that make up the backstage of Reading\u2019s Madejski Stadium, trying to find out. Kingsley (a lion, who shouldn\u2019t be confused with Kingsley the Partick Thistle mascot, the abstract yellow monster designed by artist David Shrigley) has been a Reading FC fixture since 1997. Kingsley has the dubious honour of being one of the few mascots in sport to receive a red card (for straying too close to the pitch in 2007). But when I visited him, he was behaving himself, warming up the crowd before a vital 3\u20130 win over Luton. Spirits had been low in previous weeks, with a faltering run of form and a recent managerial change, but mascots cannot sit these periods out: rain or shine, good form or bad, they are pitchside, dancing and pointing.\nI stood behind the king and queen, Kingsley and his wife, like a page as they waved at their subjects. I held doors open for them to squeeze through while they smiled at the various birthday parties they had wafted into. I basked in the reflected glory as they shimmied through the pre\u2011match bar. Everywhere Kingsley and Queensley went, people responded with joy. Children whisper-shouted their names to each other when they spotted their lion eyes glimmering through a door window. Unsmiling, 50-year season ticket holders went mushy as they shook Kingsley\u2019s royal paw.\n\u201cYou just have to be yourself in there,\u201d Kingsley\u2019s actor, Craig Peters, told me, headless, when we spoke in the staff kitchen an hour before the game. \u201cAnd I would also say: don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to say where mascots began, exactly. History is written by the winners, and the winners rarely stop to write, \u201cOh yeah, bit of a weird one: we took a pig to a football game today. Won. Might do it again, every match, for ever.\u201d\nYes, mascots bring happiness, but who allowed them to happen? They skim into the arena on a zipline. They cover their big unblinking eyes with their hands when an eight-year-old skies a half-time penalty. We accept all this. We look at Manchester United\u2019s cuddly devil mascot, Fred the Red, and think: I\u2019m completely OK with the fact that a demon sent to punish us for our sins is standing on the halfway line right now, having physical banter with Bruno Fernandes.\nBaseball, a game riddled with superstition, pioneered the US mascot, though they were mostly just children, rather than adults in animal suits. The first recorded use of the term in sport, in 1883, described a young batboy called \u201cChic\u201d, who the Pottsville Anthracites considered a good luck charm, as well as being the grunt they got to hand out bats and uniforms to the team. By the late 19th century, the mascot had moved into other sports: Yale\u2019s Handsome Dan (a bulldog belonging to student Andrew Graves) played an essential role in the ceremonial pomp that preceded the college\u2019s American football games.\nLive-animal mascots also made their way to Britain. Manchester United, newly minted from the ashes of Newton Heath, replaced Major the St Bernard with Billy the Goat, an animal belonging to half-back Charlie Roberts. Billy was paraded at Old Trafford before games, but his time came to an abrupt end following the 1909 FA Cup final win over Bristol City when, as United Museum curator Jon Sutton writes, \u201cBilly sadly died of alcohol poisoning after taking part in the post-match celebrations.\u201d\nI talked to Nick Miller, the author of Dance Like Everybody\u2019s Watching!: The Weird And Wonderful World Of Sporting Mascots, for which he studied mascots from Australia, Japan, the US and the Olympic Games, as well as West Bromwich Albion\u2019s baffling Boiler Man, a combi-boiler with arms and legs, but no eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand why a lot of these mascots can\u2019t just be nice and cuddly, or why they have to go down the nightmare route,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be for kids, really.\u201d\nMascots graduated from dogs and small children to more haunting cartoon characters with the introduction of the New York Mets\u2019 Mr Met in 1964. The body of a man with the head of a gigantic baseball, Mr Met debuted the year before as a drawing on the front of a matchday programme, but took corporeal form at the opening of the team\u2019s then-new home, Shea Stadium. His pre-match shtick proved popular: by the 1970s he was joined by Mrs Met (becoming, arguably, the first mascot power couple) and then three little Mets \u2013 all nameless, all with eerie baseball heads.\nOver the next decade, the Mets\u2019 Major League baseball rivals rushed to catch up. In 1974, the San Diego Padres introduced the San Diego Chicken, heralding a frenzied period of invention in the US, climaxing with San Francisco Giants\u2019 Crazy Crab. The crab was designed as a sort of \u201canti-mascot\u201d, who deliberately got the crowd so riled that they pelted him with beer bottles and batteries (actor Wayne Doba had to wear protective equipment inside his soft outer shell). In 1984, Crazy Crab was tackled by two of the San Diego Padres, leaving Doba incapacitated for the last two games of the season. Crazy Crab was quietly retired in 1985.\nMascots don\u2019t share an overarching aesthetic. They can be fuzzy, furry, hairy or slick; they can be aliens or monsters or animals. But the one recurring theme is that they have someone inside them, most often someone who already works for the team, who has acquired the job because, put simply, they were there. \u201cIt was a pre-season game against Bournemouth, actually,\u201d Peters tells me. \u201cMy intention was to go and just watch the game.\u201d Peters also works for Reading\u2019s community outreach programmes. \u201cAnd then my colleague said, \u2018What are you doing? Do you want to be Queensley with me?\u2019 So I did it. Then they said they didn\u2019t have a Kingsley for the upcoming season and that\u2019s when I thought, you know what, I enjoyed that.\u201d Peters says he wears \u201cjust boxers\u201d when he is Kingsley; there is no protective clothing necessary.\nMiller has spoken to more mascots than anyone else alive, and tells me he has noticed a pattern. \u201cYou don\u2019t get many careerist mascots. The origin story is always, \u2018Oh, you know, the previous guy was ill, or they needed someone, anyone, to prance around in this thing. I was there.\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to diminish the role: on a good day, the mascot becomes an extension of the crowd, urging the ball towards the net; on a bad day, they are a focal point for anger, the home crowd\u2019s howling after going 3-0 down. And on a terrible day, they might get into a fight: famously, Swansea\u2019s Cyril the Swan went head-to-head with Millwall\u2019s Zampa the Lion during a heated match in 2001. An honourable mention should also go to Watford\u2019s Harry the Hornet, who mocked Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha during a league clash in 2016. Things can get out of hand.\nThese great chapters in mascot history run through my head as I enter the turnstile to Hampton & Richmond Borough FC\u2019s Beveree stadium. It is the March weekend when the Football League abandons games because of coronavirus, but when the lower leagues are still playing. Without competition from the bigger games, there is a capacity local crowd to watch the team face their Vanarama National League South rivals, Oxford City.\nTo truly understand the psyche of the person inside the suit, I have agreed to be Hampton & Richmond\u2019s mascot, Bertie the Beaver. I retire to the female officials\u2019 changing room to become Bertie in a shower cubicle. This, I imagine, is much like any complicated, ceremonial dressing routine \u2013 buttoning up a suit on the morning of your wedding, pulling a graduation gown over your clothes \u2013 in that it slowly transforms you into a different person, with a different demeanour. When I nestle a gut-sized wad of cotton between my thighs and my stomach to give Bertie his signature belly (and, more practically, to stop rowdy children absolutely hammering me in the testicles), I feel nothing. When I clamber into a fleece bodysuit, I feel sturdy and hot. But slowly the picture comes together: I pull two paw-shaped loops over my shoes and Velcro them to my legs, then draw three-fingered gloves over my own hands. I can no longer walk unassisted.\nWearing an XXL-sized Adidas shirt over my enormous new frame, I am in matchday mode. And then, finally, the head: like a huge, padding-lined, low-visibility crown, it is Velcroed to the neck of my bodysuit by my minder, Tanc. I am now eight feet tall. My vision is reduced to a small gauze window hidden in Bertie\u2019s mouth; all audio is fuzzed out by the fleece around my ears. The inside of the head smells of fresh grass and old sweat. I have to heave each leg high off the ground in order to plant it safely in front of me. I am surrounded by cotton and darkness. Bertie the Beaver, like a demon devouring my soul, takes over.\nI cannot remember what happened when I was in the suit. There was flossing, I think. There were high fives. A group of children in matching football kits started kicking me up the bum. Throughout, I maintained a stoical silence, making huge CBBC-presenter gestures, hugging all who came near me.\nIt is interesting to see how crowds react to you when you\u2019re a large, clumsy beaver who can\u2019t get through a doorway properly: frightened children peer from the sides of the stands to play peekaboo; drunk lads sprinkle fag ash on your shoulder as they pose for a completely irony-free selfie; weatherbeaten older blokes, heads down on the way to the bar, gleefully poke you in the belly pad.\nWalking off the pitch after I had loomed eerily over the pre-match coin toss, I saw a sullen teenager, sulkily watching from the sidelines, half-peering at his phone. I blasted him with two finger-guns. Nothing. I shook my entire body in a woeful dance. Not a flicker of emotion. Slowly, deliberately, I peeled up to him, my hand extended in a high five. And yes, you know it. I am Beaver, I am fur, I am irresistible. I am Bertie. He smacked my hand and cracked into a smile.\nI am mascot, destroyer of sadness. My work out here is done.\n Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

        "content": "Tears flowed in packed press boxes as the razzle-dazzle of the NFL had unbelievably arrived in London after decades of passion across the pond\nIt was a night for raincoats and thermals at Wembley on 28 October 2007, not T-shirt and shorts; hot drinks not cold brewskis at the tailgate party for the sensible in the crowd of 81,176; and the sodden pitch, designed for football, cut up in seconds leaving huge divots and bad first impressions.\nThe only play worth highlighting was Eli Manning\u2019s super slow-motion 10-yard run for New York\u2019s only touchdown and the final score was barely relevant to most either. It was an event, with a capital E, V, E, N and T because this was the first regular-season NFL game played outside North America, the culmination of decades of endeavour in the UK.\nChannel 4 showed highlights - extraordinary to think these days but on a week delay - in 1982 and the late-night Super Bowl ritual was formed. A weekly American football newspaper, First Down, was produced, a domestic competition sprung up and there were pre-season American Bowl games at Wembley from 1986-1993. There were the heady days of the World League and the London Monarchs winning the first World Bowl in 1991, provoking semi-serious discussion of a game between them and the worst team of the 1990 NFL season, which, rather remarkably given the past 20-odd years, was New England.\nIt was all that and more. The late Sunday nights listening to the Armed Forces Network as its medium-wave signal faded in and out, whistling and crackling live commentaries. Then came weekly live games on TV every Sunday and Monday and the emergence of a market big enough to satisfy the NFL\u2019s rapacious desire for yet more millions of dollars.\nIt was scarcely believable that here were two NFL teams, right in front of us with all the rigamarole and pageantry; at kick-off thousands of cameras lit up the dark sky. There were tears in the packed press boxes.\nThose closer to the action were also in awe. David Tossell, of the NFL London office, told me: \u201cEven when we first knew we were going to be staging the game it was pretty daunting, so the moment that always sticks with me was when The Feeling were performing the pre-game show and my boss and I looked around at the packed stands and turned to each other and said: \u2018Wow, we did it.\u2019\u201d\nThings moved so quickly it was noticeable to the players. Osi Umenyiora, the former Giant, born in England and now an award-winning analyst for the BBC, said: \u201cThe crowd was amazing but I wasn\u2019t sure how much they understood about what they were seeing. I really noticed a difference when I returned to play for the Atlanta Falcons.\u201d\nThat was in 2014 and the International Series, as it is now marketed, featured four games in London last year, two at Wembley and two at Tottenham\u2019s new stadium with a pitch and dressing rooms installed especially for the sport. Every year talk of a franchise in London builds while the expansion of the NFL season to 17 games provoked the theory of every team playing once outside the US. That appears unlikely for now, as is fanciful talk of a Super Bowl being played in London.\nOn a micro level, in September the NFL Academy opened in north London, giving young athletes the opportunity to combine full-time education with training from professional coaches. The aim is for the best to go to colleges in the US and, though a huge long shot, the NFL.\nThere is another lasting effect of this game that benefits all those who visit Wembley now. The stadium\u2019s creaky infrastructure was overwhelmed that night and the NFL demanded major improvement. Thus, anyone who uses the wifi at Wembley can thank the NFL for the massive, free upgrade.",

Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them.\nThe World Health Organization said on Friday that there was currently \u201cno evidence\u201d that people who have recovered from coronavirus are protected from a second infection \u2013 even if they now have antibodies against it.\nIn a statement, the UN health agency warned against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificates\u201d to people who have been infected, saying the practice may actually increase the risk of spread as those given them may ignore standard advice.\nIt also warned that the accuracy and reliability of tests for antibodies to coronavirus were not certain.\nChina sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to four sources and diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters.\nThe report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend in European time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak puts strain on international relations.\nCases of the coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin America\u2019s largest country veers closer to becoming one of the world\u2019s pandemic hotspots, the Associated Press reports.\nMedical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients.\nHealth experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient, delayed testing.\nGreece is preparing to ease lockdown measures, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, holding back-to-back teleconference calls today to discuss how best to roll back the restrictions.\nA return to post-lockdown normality is expected to begin on Monday 4 May, when small shops, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians will go back to work. One senior government aide told the Guardian that the opening of barbers and hairdressers was regarded as a much-needed \u201cpsychological boost\u201d after what would be almost two months of severe restrictions.\nNHS England has launched an awareness campaign to urge people to seek medical help if they need it, after visits to hospital emergency departments fell by almost half this month amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak.\nNHS officials said they were worried that meant people were avoiding hospitals for fear of catching the virus, thereby jeopardising their lives and potentially becoming collateral damage.",

        "content": "The president of the Dutch football association, the KNVB, has cast doubt on the feasibility of the Premier League playing matches behind closed doors in June, even as the British government suggested it might be possible for some sports to resume within a few weeks.\nSenior government officials including chief medical officers will meet with medical directors of the major sports over the next few days to discuss the challenges each face in returning to action, in the belief that televised events would provide a boost to national morale. The move was a \u201cquickening of the pace\u201d and aimed to restore sporting competition \u201cwithin weeks\u201d, according to the BBC.\nThe Premier League is talking to its UK live rights holders, Sky and BT Sport, over how many games might be televised in June and on what payment basis, though Just Spee, who made the difficult decision to declare the season in the Netherlands null and void on Friday, believes it might be overoptimistic to imagine the English season could be played to a satisfactory conclusion.\nThe KNVB president said: \u201cThe UK will hold on to a sliver of hope as long as it is there, but in reality the chances of completing the Premier League season are slim. The English season will need a number of weeks to complete and I doubt there will be enough time. Seeing what is happening with things getting postponed week by week it is probably not realistic.\u201d\nThe Dutch FA may still face legal action from certain clubs adversely affected by the decision to scrap the season with no champions, promotion or relegation. That consideration is at the forefront of minds in England as the various interested parties try to find a way forward through the lockdown.\nThe problem in both countries is the difficulty of reaching unanimous agreement on any particular strategy, with some clubs suited by early closure and some with every reason to want to play on. When the 34 clubs that form the top two divisions in the Netherlands put the matter to a vote there was no clear majority for any solution, so faced with a hopelessly divided meeting Spee and the KNVB board decided emergency leadership was necessary and forced through an unpopular policy.\nWhile other countries are making tentative plans for a return of fixtures behind closed doors, many are still worried about the safety aspects involved. The Spanish players\u2019 association has requested clarity on the coronavirus testing programme. \u201cIt will take a lot of testing to be declared safe, and other groups in society might need the testing more than we do,\u201d a spokesman said.\nThe English Football League expressed similar concerns, saying any restart had to have \u201cabsolutely no negative impact\u201d on frontline workers and the emergency services.\nIn the event of behind-closed-doors games going ahead in this country there is also the fear that fans will gather outside stadiums or in public places in contravention of physical-distancing rules, a particular concern on Merseyside with Liverpool within touching distance of their first league title in 30 years.\nSpee doubts the English season will resume, though he does agree that a 25-point lead means Liverpool deserve to be declared champions. \u201cWe could not do that in the Eredivisie, because there was no team so far in front,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the same when Liverpool is so way out compared to the rest, but you also have to take on board what the rest of society is going through. Should we really be talking about champions in such a year?\u201d",

        "content": "Seine-Saint-Denis has long been one of France\u2019s poorest areas, but the pandemic has laid bare social rifts as never before\nIn his small apartment in Paris\u2019s outer suburbs , the 85-year-old\u2019s food cupboards were bare. When volunteers arrived, the man was down to a crust of old baguette and a few dry biscuits. Living alone and with no family, the pensioner, who had come from Morocco to France after the war to help rebuild the railways, was too afraid to leave his home.\n\u201cHe was trapped there with nothing to eat and hadn\u2019t seen his doctor in weeks,\u201d said Abdelaali El Badaoui, founder of charity Banlieues Sant\u00e9.\n\u201cHe hadn\u2019t eaten for days and was frightened and confused. We were able to give him supplies for a week and call his doctor to arrange a remote consultation. Since then we\u2019ve been doing weekly follow-up visits and dropping off his medicine. He\u2019s doing well.\u201d\nFrance has now been in coronavirus lockdown for six weeks, and has seen more than 21,000 deaths from the virus. But social distancing in the neuf-trois, the deprived Seine-Saint-Denis d\u00e9partement north of Paris, looks very different to that of Saint-Tropez, where billionaires in a gated compound were reported last week to be paying for private Covid-19 tests.\n\u201cWe are locked down in our inequality,\u201d said the Seine-Saint-Denis MP Alexis Corbi\u00e8re. \u201cThe virus has just amplified the problems the banlieue has had for a long time. It has revealed how wide and deep the social fracture really is.\u201d\nFor decades le neuf-trois has broken records: the poorest area of mainland France, with more than 28% of residents \u2013 a large number of them immigrants \u2013 living below the breadline; the highest unemployment \u2013 up to 40% in some districts; the most social housing \u2013 10% of which is sub-standard; and inadequate public services. Even before the pandemic it was a grim symbol of France\u2019s inequalities in wealth, opportunity and living standards.\nNow, as the virus hits the most vulnerable, those rifts are clear as never before. In March, the national statistics institute, Insee, found the death rate in Seine-Saint-Denis up 62% on the previous year. Undertakers said they were overwhelmed.\nWith 1.6 million inhabitants, making it one of France\u2019s most densely populated departments, Seine-Saint-Denis has the lowest number of doctors per head, but the highest rates of obesity and diseases including cancer, diabetes and asthma.\n\u201cMany arrive at hospital already in a critical condition because they tend not to have regular care or contact with the health system,\u201d said Corbi\u00e8re, a member of the hard-left La France Insoumise. \u201cAnd a lot of people here have jobs that can\u2019t be done from home: underpaid frontline jobs like cleaners, builders, refuse collectors \u2013 people who have to use public transport and so are more exposed.\u201d\nMehdi Bigaderne, 37, co-founder of Aclefeu, a collective set up in 2005 after rioting in the mostly north African Clichy-sous-Bois neighbourhood, said problems had all been exacerbated by the virus.\n\u201cIt has exploded the myth that we are all equal because clearly we\u2019re not. People are trying to respect the lockdown, but what do you do if you\u2019re a family of five or more in a small apartment on the 15th floor? How do you keep children in? How do you feed them when the markets where you buy cheap fruit and vegetables have closed and you can\u2019t afford supermarkets? How can families whose children normally eat in school canteens now make three meals a day?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not new that Seine-Saint-Denis is a place of inequality, discrimination and social problems, but coronavirus has crystallised this.\u201d\nAs well as distributing \u201clockdown packages\u201d of food, toiletries and a mask, Banlieues Sant\u00e9 has recruited doctors to make multilingual videos explaining how people can protect themselves and has translated the document that all French people needed to carry to leave their homes into around 20 languages.\nAmong those it has helped is Yvette Maurice, 85, who lives alone in a 12-storey block. Suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, she was worried about buying food. \u201cI received food packages for the last three weeks and it was a huge relief as it meant I could stay at home,\u201d said Maurice.\nBadaoui, a hospital cleaner who trained as a nurse, recalls a single mother of four who had symptoms of Covid-19 but was threatened with the sack if she didn\u2019t turn up for her cleaning job: \u201cWe were able to advise her of her rights \u2013 that she could self-isolate at home without losing her job. In so many cases, social problems have to be resolved before medical issues.\u201d\nNot all his stories have happy endings. On a visit to one housing estate, volunteers found an elderly Algerian man, a former caretaker who had lived in France since the 1940s, dead in his home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing we have experienced,\u201d Badaoui said. \u201cWe are the very last chance for many people. We act as a bridge between the health service and those most in need, some of whom are no longer in contact with health services or never were.\u201d\nSeine-Saint-Denis saw clashes last week between youths and police, sparked by a motorcyclist hitting a police car and being thrown from his bike, suffering a broken leg. There were accusations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown.\n\u201cThe banlieue is not aflame,\u201d said Corbi\u00e8re. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a few fireworks, not riots. We\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d\nBigaderne agreed: \u201cThose involved in recent events are a very small minority and a lot of it is down to frustration.\u201d\nThe government and local authorities have pledged emergency payments to struggling families, but many in Seine-Saint-Denis will see little benefit .\n\u201cNot everyone, including the homeless and those without official papers, has the same access to rights,\u201d Bigaderne said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t reduce the social inequalities in these areas, there will always be problems. We\u2019ve been saying this for 15 years. We cannot keep putting plasters over serious wounds.\u201dCorbi\u00e8re added that the crisis had also shown the depth of human solidarity within the banlieue\u2019s many communities: \u201cThe virus has rocked society. Will it change things? We can but hope.\u201d",

Many families have been forced to hold remote funeral services for loved ones who died since the coronavirus lockdown began.\nEarlier this month, the funeral of a 13-year-old boy from Brixton who died after testing positive for coronavirus took place without his family members.\n\u201cWe understand that there has been public concern regarding the events of yesterday,\u201d Boyce said.\n\u201cWe want to sincerely thank the majority of the public, many of whom are struggling with the loss of loved ones, who have not risked the safety of others by attending gatherings such as funerals in breach of government guidelines,\u201d she added.\nLast week, a teenager died after he was hit by a motorcycle at a funeral in Kent attended by 150 people in defiance of coronavirus physical distancing rules.\nAaron Smith, 17, who had three children, suffered fatal head injuries in the incident near Sittingbourne on Thursday.",

        "content": "A potential \u00a31bn bill now faces the sector, but the real problem will be maintaining quality for students in a radically altered world this September\nUK universities need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to deliver degrees online, with warnings that many are unprepared to deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on students\u2019 education.\nOnly around 20 universities are in a good position to provide a range of high-quality online courses by the start of the new academic year in September, according to Prof Sir Tim O\u2019Shea, the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University. Some of the country\u2019s top-ranked Russell Group institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge, were not in that category, he added.\nThe warning comes as the sector seeks to expand online education in a bid to offset huge losses from tens of thousands of international students cancelling their studies due to Covid-19. Prolonged social distancing also mean freshers could face a radically different university experience, with no lectures on campus and bars closed.\nMost universities would face costs of at least \u00a310m to create five or six new online degrees in different faculties, said O\u2019Shea, a leading expert on computer-based learning. This would total well over \u00a31bn across the sector.\nThe costs will add to the financial pressures facing universities, with a report from the University and College Union (UCU) forecastingthat the sector could lose around \u00a32.5bn next year in tuition fees alone if the pandemic continues.\nO\u2019Shea recommended that universities focus on providing the first-year courses for up to five faculties, at a cost of \u00a33m to \u00a37.5 m.\nHis stark assessment came as Durham University stalled controversial plans to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing next year. The proposals, drawn up by senior managers and private provider Cambridge Education Group Digital, said lecturers would only need six hours of training, and could create online degree modules in six to 12 weeks.\nO\u2019Shea described Durham\u2019s proposals as \u201chopelessly unrealistic\u201d, adding that it was \u201cquite impossible\u201d for universities to deliver new online courses for this September unless they were already running successfully elsewhere. Even those universities with existing online provision would need 12 to 18 months to deliver new courses, he added.\nPrivate education firms said they have been inundated with requests from universities to help them deliver online education next year. Online learning platform Coursera has received enquiries from more than 6,000 universities in 120 countries since the pandemic began.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing from lots of universities that are facing major budget cuts, so even if they are planning to move all teaching online, they don\u2019t have the core infrastructure to do this,\u201d said Coursera\u2019s chief enterprise officer, Leah Belsky.\nProfessor Neil Morris, dean of digital education at Leeds University, said lower-ranked UK universities would struggle to attract private partners to help them deliver online courses. \u201cThe companies only go to the top universities, because they want to use their brand to attract high fee-paying students [to] generate more money,\u201d he said.\nMany universities would also balk at sharing student fee revenue with private firms, Morris added. But the costs to universities of developing digital education in-house are huge. The deputy vice-chancellor of Coventry University, Ian Dunn, said it took two years and \u201ctens of millions of pounds\u201d to deliver 19 fully online degrees since 2017.\nO\u2019Shea divided the UK universities into four categories: those with the capacity and will to develop high-quality online education, including the Open University, King\u2019s College London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Coventry; those with the capacity but not the will, such as Oxford and Cambridge; those with the will but not the capacity, such as Durham; and those with neither the will nor the capacity, such as art schools and music conservatoires.\nSome subjects, such as the sciences, would be particularly difficult to shift online. The Open University launched its OpenSTEM Labs in 2015, providing students with remote access to laboratories and observatories via remotely-operated robotic instruments. But experts noted that no other UK university has comparable provision.\nAris Katzourakis, co-president of the UCU branch at Oxford University, said staff would in many cases not be able to replicate laboratory classes online. The zoology professor added that \u201cthese elements will not be taught to students to the same level\u201d.\nIn a blog this month on the impact of the coronavirus on higher education, the former universities minister, Jo Johnson, wrote that the crisis has exposed how many UK universities lagged behind their international competitors in developing online learning and were \u201cclearly scrambling to provide anything resembling a coherent online offering\u201d.\nMartin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University, said there was a danger that university senior managers underestimated the difficulty of delivering learning online.\nWeller said lecturers have told him they have been given a week\u2019s notice to put their course online, and a fortnight to develop a digital strategy. He said: \u201cA danger might be that we see a backlash against online learning because people rush to do it and it\u2019s done badly.\u201d\nDiana Laurillard, professor of learning with digital technologies at University College London\u2019s Institute of Education, said the shift to online learning required a complete overhaul of traditional higher education. One-hour lectures and workshops would need to be broken up into smaller 10-20 minute webinars, interspersed with practical exercises, question-and-answer sessions and discussion groups.\nStaff also needed to provide more pastoral care for students studying on their own. \u201cThere\u2019s much more guidance involved when you\u2019re not [physically] there,\u201d she added.\nA spokeswoman for the National Union of Students said: \u201cIt is obvious that, regardless of quality, online learning simply cannot replicate the laboratory-based or practical learning of many courses.\u201d\nAn Oxford University spokeswoman said its staff have rapidly \u201cbought into the idea that we can deliver teaching and assessment entirely remotely\u201d.\nProf Graham Virgo, senior pro-vice-chancellor of education at Cambridge University, said it had taken steps to increase online learning, including a partnership with private education firm edX. He added: \u201cThe university is developing ambitious plans to expand its online provision.\u201d\nProf Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor of Durham University, said it was preparing to teach all courses on campus in September \u201cwhile also ensuring that teaching can go online if there is a lockdown later in the year or in 2021\u201d.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said it was \u201cdelighted to see so many providers developing innovative ways of providing quality education, online and remotely\u201d.\nMarcus Matthews, a final-year history student at the University of Southampton.\n\u201cIt has been quite disappointing, specifically from my faculty, the extent of the response to this crisis, although my degree has limited contact time anyway \u2013 it is mainly discussions in the two two-hour sessions we have per week.\n\u201cIn order to replace this, all we are now doing is posting at least three comments on an online discussion board per session. It is now a case of \u2018do the reading, post your comments\u2019. There appears to be no form of moderation.\n\u201cThis decision was made without consultation with students, and also the faculty stressed in an email to bear with the staff as they are having to deal with new technology such as \u2018phone, Skype and Microsoft Teams\u2019.\n\u201cThis is at a Russell Group uni. There is effectively no incentive to partake in this online learning, as it is in such a simple and condescending format with no consequence if we do it or not. As of this week, only one student has contributed, with one comment. It has effectively ruined the last five weeks of learning of what otherwise would have been an interesting module.\u201d Rachel Hall",

        "content": "The US president plans to \u2018pare back\u2019 his daily coronavirus briefings after falsely claiming his suggestion to inject cleaning products had been \u2018sarcastic\u2019\nFor Donald Trump, it was the strangest and most news-making thing he could have done: instead of taking questions from journalists, dominating the nation\u2019s airwaves yet again, the US president gave a short pre-written statement and then stalked off the stage.\nThe abrupt end of Friday night\u2019s daily press conference, which has become a ribald, unruly and often shocking ritual in America during the coronavirus pandemic, was probably the clearest sign yet of how badly Trump\u2019s bizarre statements over disinfectant have shaken his administration.\nInstead of going on the offensive after the world reacted with shock and horror to his Thursday night suggestion that the coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into a human body, Trump claimed he was being \u201csarcastic\u201d and then retreated from public view.\nThe New York Times reported that some officials in the White House thought \u201cit was one of the worst days in one of the worst weeks of his presidency.\u201d\nBut it was Trump\u2019s silence on Friday night that spoke volumes.\n  White House coronavirus taskforce briefings are often two-hour primetime marathons but on Friday Trump turned on his heel as reporters shouted questions in vain. Perhaps it was a fit of pique, or perhaps revenge on the reporters that he sees as persecutors. He may also have reached a tipping point, with his own advisers warning that the televised briefings are hurting him far more than they help.\n  Right on cue, minutes later, the Axios website reported that Trump plans to \u201cpare back\u201d his coronavirus press conferences, according to four of its sources. Next week, it said, \u201che may stop appearing daily and make shorter appearances when he does\u201d.\nIf he does that then Trump\u2019s remarks over disinfectant will have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back over the nightly ritual of the virus briefings. For weeks they have dominated the US headlines as the nation struggles to come to terms with a pandemic that has cost 50,000 American lives. They have provided a canvas for Trump\u2019s rage, a platform from which he can attack his enemies and \u2013 only occasionally \u2013 a place where an American president can seek to reassure a scared and besieged public enduring stay-at-home orders to curb the virus.\nBut Trump\u2019s remarks over disinfectant changed all that.\nOn Thursday, Trump had suggested that doctors study the idea of people receiving injections of disinfectant to combat the virus. He also extolled the potential and unproven benefits of ultraviolet light. Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product. Trump\u2019s comments generated internet memes and headlines around the world.\nHis old rival from 2016, Hillary Clinton, chimed in with a quick jab on Twitter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t poison yourself because Donald Trump thinks it could be a good idea,\u201d she said. His new rival for the 2020 election, former vice-president Joe Biden, also pitched in. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to say this, but please don\u2019t drink bleach,\u201d he said, mixing mockery with a public service announcement.\nFrom almost the moment the words left Trump\u2019s mouth it was clear some sort of damage limitation was needed.\nBut, as shock and amazement traversed the globe, it was slow in coming. When it did arrive, on Friday lunchtime, it was a clean-up attempt that clearly could have gone better. At a White House event Trump tried to justify his dangerous comments, falsely claiming that he was \u201casking a question sarcastically to reporters\u201d.\nOn Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000 and the grim milestone of 1 million coronavirus cases grows nearer, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest U-turn.\n\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.\n\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d\nBut video of the briefings clearly demonstrated otherwise. There was no hint of sarcasm and Trump\u2019s attempts to rewrite the immediate past were undermined by the evidence just a simple Google search away.\nWhen Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce coordinator.\nBut Trump \u2013 in his attempt at damage limitation \u2013 gamely pressed on. The Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him.\nHe replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d\nOne more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d\nTrump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d\nBut Trump\u2019s familiar turf of attacking the media was not working. In the middle of a pandemic, with Americans dying in their hundreds every day, the leader of the administration trying to guide the nation back to safety and normality had put even more lives at risk. His jumbled, inaccurate assertions only deepened concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.\nScott Gottlieb, Trump\u2019s own former Food and Drug Administration director, was among those many people now forced to warn Americans not to follow their own president\u2019s advice. He told a CNBC interviewer: \u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d\nThe scandal exploded just a day after a New York Times report that detailed how Trump is coping with the pressures and isolation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In a lengthy piece it portrayed a US president who has become cut off from many of his former friends and associates as he lives and works in the White House, unable to leave and travel and hold the campaign rallies that he appears to crave.\nIt described Trump bingeing on cable news for many hours each morning and often late into the night, surveying the wreckage of a once-booming economy that he had planned on being the main plank of his reelection strategy.",

        "content": "The US states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska have begun loosening lockdown orders on their pandemic-wounded businesses, even as the confirmed US death toll from Covid-19 has passed 50,000 and despite warnings from health experts that such steps may be coming too early.\nOther states, such as Florida and Michigan, are also showing some tentative signs of starting to ease restrictions. In Colorado Governor Jared Polis has announced that a previously issued \u201cstay-at-home\u201d mandate is being updated to a \u201csafer-at-home\u201d mandate, with select businesses also now reopening. In Texas some businesses, including restaurants, have opened in defiance of state guidance.\nThe tentative first moves feed into a national debate over how much and how quickly the US should reopen as the virus wreaks both economic carnage that has cratered the once-booming economy but also continues to kill hundreds of Americans every day.\nIt is a debate that has sometimes pitted the White House against some governors, often of Democratic-run states reluctant to ease restrictions while the pandemic still rages. It has also raised the prospect of a patchwork reopening across the US, which many health experts worry will hamper the national effort to contain and then minimize the virus.\nRepublican governors in Georgia and Oklahoma allowed salons, spas and barbershops to reopen, while Alaska opened the way for restaurants to resume dine-in service and retail shops and other businesses to open their doors, all with limitations. Some Alaska municipalities chose to maintain stricter rules.\nEven in some other states and jurisdictions that are moving more slowly there have been tentative signs of reopening. In Orange county in southern California beaches have reopened, though beach car parks remain closed and non-residents have been urged to stay away.\nThough limited in scope, and subject to social-distancing restrictions, the reopenings marked a symbolic milestone in the debate in the United States and beyond as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically devastating lockdown orders.\nDuring a White House press briefing on Friday, Donald Trump spoke optimistically of the economy but also asked people to continue social distancing and using face coverings. The same day, Trump signed a $484bn bill to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the pandemic. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about one in six US workers.\nTrump also claimed his widely criticized comments suggesting people can ingest or inject disinfectant to fight Covid-19 was an attempt at sarcasm.\nThe coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including \u2013 as of Friday \u2013 more than 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.\nAmy Pembrook and her husband, Mike, reopened their hair salon in the Oklahoma town of Fairview after it had been shuttered for about a month.\n\u201cWe\u2019re super excited about going back, but we have caught a little flak from people who say it\u2019s too early,\u201d Amy Pembrook said. \u201cWe just said we can live in fear for a long time or we can trust that everything is going to be OK.\u201d\nWithout a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are mandatory in some places, a recommendation elsewhere.\nMeanwhile, testing continues to lag across the United States. To date, according to data compiled by the Covid Tracking Project, just under 4.7 million people have been tested in the country of 330 million. Researchers at Harvard University have estimated a minimum of 500,000 daily tests are needed, and possibly much more, in order to safely reopen the economy.\nIn Florida, the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said his administration plans to let pharmacists administer tests to reach a broader range of people, including those with no symptoms who believe they may have been exposed.\nIn Michigan, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, lengthened her stay-at-home order through 15 May, while lifting restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities such as golf and boating. Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to Covid-19, behind only New York and New Jersey.\nNew York reported its lowest number of daily Covid-19 deaths in weeks on Friday. The state recorded 422 deaths as of the day before \u2013 the fewest since 31 March, when it recorded 391 deaths. More than 17,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak.",

        "content": "Deer roam city streets and hedgehogs can safely cross roads\u2026 but a radical policy shift is needed to protect wildlife in future, say campaigners\nBritain\u2019s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.\nNikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.\u201d\nJust one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant Himalayan balsam, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.\nMeanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.\nWhile staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.\nOne noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.\nAccording to the BTO\u2019s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn\u2019t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its Garden BirdWatch scheme, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded.\nMathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cMany of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.\u201d\nThe RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers.\nAs well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of goats roaming the streets of Llandudno, and fallow deer in the east London suburbs, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels.\nThe lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers.\nThe big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of \u201cnormal\u201d, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit.\nBut that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 Williams points out. \u201cWhen the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.\u201d",

It\u2019s a striking image that appears early in South African writer-director Oliver Hermanus\u2019s brilliant, brutal fourth feature, a historical drama about the young white men who were conscripted and trained to defend the apartheid regime in the early 1980s. This prologue sets up Hermanus\u2019s army-bound protagonist as a solitary figure whose differences, however well-hidden, will isolate him from his comrades. Composer Braam du Toit\u2019s tense, dissonant string-led score gives a further sense of an internal storm brewing.\nMoffie, the film\u2019s title, translates as a derogatory gay slur, Afrikaans for \u201cfaggot\u201d. An undeniable homoerotic charge runs through scenes set in army barracks, with glistening male bodies lavishly observed and bringing to mind the graceful legionnaires in Claire Denis\u2019s 1999 film Beau Travail. The quiet, closeted Nicholas finds himself drawn to new recruit and provocateur Stassen (Ryan de Villiers), but Hermanus treats any love story as subtext. In doing so, he\u2019s able to turn his attention to the visceral sadism of the South African National Defence Force, critiquing the emotional and physical toll of such a toxic regime.\nMoffie is available to stream on Curzon Home Cinema",

This was compared with just \u00a3310m in 2018.\nBusiness is brisk among those countries which the Foreign Office itself identifies as having poor human rights records.\nIn 2018, the UK sold \u00a3173m worth of arms to states on the Foreign Office list of \u201chuman rights priority countries\u201d \u2013 nations identified as having human rights issues.\nBut last year this increased to \u00a3849m, an increase of 390%.\nAndrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade, said: \u201cThe UK government is always telling us how robust its arms export controls supposedly are, but these figures make clear that nothing could be further from the truth. The UK arms industry is dominated by human rights abusers, despots and dictatorships.\n\u201cThe figures may be good for the arms dealers, but these weapons could be used in atrocities and abuses for years to come.\u201d\nMost of the growth came from the Middle East: 2019 was a lucrative year in terms of licences to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and UAE.\nThe increase could have been significantly larger. A court ruling freezing arms sales to Saudi Arabia had a considerable impact on UK exports to the kingdom in the second half of last year.\nAnd the figures do not include open licences which allow the export of an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period, typically between three and five years.\nIn 2018, the Observer revealed that, for the previous five years, the UK had been selling missiles and bombs to the Saudis under the open licence system.\n\u201cThese sales are only possible because of the complicity of the UK government, which has consistently put arms company profits ahead of human rights,\u201d Smith said.\n\u201cUK-made fighter jets and bombs are doing terrible damage in Yemen. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and depleted the healthcare system in a time of crisis.\u201d\nA government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK assesses all export licence applications on a case-by-case basis in line with our strict licensing criteria.\n\u201cWe will not issue export licences where to do so would be inconsistent with these criteria, including where we assess there is a clear risk that equipment might be used for internal repression.\u201d",

Britain has the fifth highest official coronavirus death toll in the world, after the US, Italy, Spain and France.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cAs of 5pm on 24 April, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 20,319 have sadly died.\u201d\nSpeaking at the daily Downing Street briefing on Saturday, Priti Patel said: \u201cAs the deaths caused by this terrible virus pass another tragic and terrible milestone, the entire nation is grieving.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, both said last month that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome\u201d.\nAsked about the comment on Saturday, Powis said: \u201cWhen [we] made that comment a number of weeks ago, what we were emphasising is that this is a new virus, a global pandemic, a once-in-a-century global health crisis. And this was going to be a huge challenge not just for the UK, but for every country.\u201d\nPowis said it was \u201ca very sad day for the nation\u201d and that the current crisis was \u201cnot something we are going to get over in the next few weeks\u201d. He added: \u201cI think moving past 20,000 deaths just reminds everybody that it is still absolutely critical that we continue to follow the social distancing guidelines.\u201d\nThe total number of fatalities is likely to be much higher than the current official toll, largely because deaths in care homes are not included in the government\u2019s daily update.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculated that deaths in care homes for week 15 of 2020, between 3 and 10 April, are more than double compared with the five-year average.\nA \u201ccautious estimate\u201d from the Financial Times put the overall UK death toll at 45,200 as of Friday. As of 10 April, the hospital toll underestimated deaths by about 40%.\nAlthough the numbers of new fatalities have been dropping for a few days, experts said it could be another two weeks until the death rate will start to decline quickly.\nThe death toll passed the 20,000 mark after 711 new deaths were recorded in England, where the overall hospital death toll stands at 18,084.\nThe 711 people who were included in the government\u2019s daily update of fatalities on Saturday were aged between 34 and 100 years old.
