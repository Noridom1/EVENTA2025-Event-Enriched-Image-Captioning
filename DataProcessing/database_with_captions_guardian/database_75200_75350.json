The additional VAT will be charged within the fare and not displayed to the passenger.\nIt is understood that Uber may effectively subsidise some fares, as a spokesperson said fare rises would vary from city to city, but refused to divulge further details on pricing on the grounds it was competitively sensitive.\nApp users have been notified on a change in the terms and conditions which will mean passengers contract directly with Uber, rather than the driver, from 11.59pm on Monday.\nWhile the original ruling only applied to Uber\u2019s business model in London, its biggest market, a spokesman said it was applying the changes nationwide in anticipation of further legal changes.\nOther operators will be legally required to follow suit in London, although they have yet to confirm plans.\nAn Uber spokesperson said: \u201cWe have completed the changes to our business model as required by law. Other operators in London are also required to make changes to their models to comply with the relevant law.\n\u201cUber operates in an intensely competitive market and we are committed to always offering consumers affordable prices. As always, riders will get a trip price before booking their journey.\u201d\nThe changes came after judges initially queried Uber\u2019s status during a court case where the multinational company was fighting a judgment that drivers were workers with rights.\nThe rise in fares comes after Uber hiked prices in the capital by 10% last November to attract more drivers. It will also hit Londoners\u2019 pockets weeks after a nearly 5% fare rise on public transport in the city.",

        "content": "Chelsea\u2019s ownership is finally facing deserved scrutiny but there is a double standard when it comes to Newcastle\u2019s owners\nThe internet always knows what you want. This week a particular video clip has been popping up in those wormholes filled with adverts at the side of my screen, pressing its nose up against the glass for hours on end like an unhappy cat mewling at the window.\nAlan Shearer slams Roman Abramovich over Ukraine statement. There it is again. And here is the text of Alan\u2019s actual slamming: \u201cThere\u2019s still no condemnation from Roman or the club about what\u2019s happening in Ukraine.\u201d It is a robust and sincere statement, deserving of serious treatment. So let\u2019s break this down.\nAlan Shearer has clearly looked at the facts. And he has decided that the invasion of a neighbouring state, the bombing of civilians, the use of advanced weaponry: all of this is unacceptable.\nBy extension, for an English football club to be owned by someone complicit in such crimes, well that is unacceptable too. This is non-negotiable. As Alan Shearer rightly states, we cannot have our football clubs tarnished, sullied, or linked with regimes that may be guilty of such crimes.\nAt which point three possibilities present themselves. Alan Shearer has never heard of the war in Yemen. Alan Shearer is unaware of who Mohammed bin Salman is, or what he does as his main day job. Or third, Alan Shearer is wiling to overlook both of these things because he really likes and cares about Newcastle United.\nAnd sadly at this point the world does start to intrude. It isn\u2019t hard to make the connection here. Newcastle United are owned by a fund that is governed by a state. And that state is also, like Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, involved in the bloodstained invasion of a neighbouring state.\nFor the last seven years Saudi Arabia has been waging a war that has led to the deaths of an estimated quarter of a million people, not to mention famine, chaos and societal collapse. The organisation Human Rights Watch has called for an investigation into the role of Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 who, to be clear, manages the fund that runs Newcastle United - for alleged war crimes.\nAnd yet instead of calling out, say, Amanda Staveley for failing to condemn these issues Alan Shearer believes instead that the takeover of Newcastle by the Saudi fund is \u201ca special day\u201d filled not with pain, guilt and chicanery, but with hope. It might be funny. If only it wasn\u2019t so depressing, and so difficult.\nThis is not an unprovoked, ad hominem attack on Alan Shearer. It is a considered, ad principium attack on the world view he is espousing. I like and admire Alan Shearer, both as a great ex-footballer \u2013 among the best in the world in his pomp \u2013 and as a pundit too, a role he has grown into from the early awkwardness as a rather taciturn ex-pro, to his current incarnation as an honest, forensic and informative dispenser of truths.\nExcept, not so much here. That state of cognitive dissonance is just too weird to gloss over. Shall we set it out here, just to be clear? Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the British government because he is \u201cassociated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.\u201d\nWhat happens if we take these words and transpose them? Because Newcastle\u2019s ownership is not just \u201cassociated with\u201d or distantly tied to the destabilising, undermining and Biblical-scale destruction of it own neighbour Yemen. It is openly and personally engaged in it.\nThis not a link that needs to be proven or teased out. It is literally the same person overseeing both the football fund and the fighter jets. And given it is now OK, and indeed de rigueur to suggest Chelsea\u2019s trophies are stained by the blood of the citizens of Kyiv and Mariupol, it has been an odd thing to scan the sports websites and slip between these two extremes.\nOver here we have the guilt and the shame of Chelsea. And then just below the news from Newcastle about what an excellent job Eddie Howe is doing (which he really is) and what a smart, entirely commendable bit of spending that \u00a380m winter window investment is turning out to be.\nThis is not whataboutery. It is literally the same thing. Football owner + bloody war = undesirable. This is genuine equivalence. An estimated 10,000 children have been killed or maimed in Yemen. Shouldn\u2019t someone in football also care about it just a little? Alan? Are there, like, any more videos?\nThere are two things worth saying about this. First, it is just so hard, and so complex. It\u2019s not the fault of the club\u2019s supporters, who are being asked to process and take a view on something that has so many angles, and who only really come to this place for a little light and joy, to savour that connection. This thing has been foisted on all of us. How do we solve it?\nPerhaps some basic clarity would help. This is the second thing here. The truth is quite simple. We don\u2019t talk about sanctioning Saudi, or have images of the war in Yemen placed in front of us on a daily basis for one very obvious reason. Saudi is an ally. Whereas Russia is hostile.\nCheck back and Abramovich was also hit with sanctions because the government suspects he has been \u201csupplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks\u201d. Let\u2019s take that across too. Newcastle\u2019s fund is owned by an entity that is literally, not potentially, sending tanks to kill civilians. But in this case those arms are supplied by Britain.\nTo date the UK has supplied the Saudi coalition with \u00a310bn of Typhoon and Tornado aircraft, Paveway bombs, Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles. Zoom out and it isn\u2019t hard to picture a world where Putin is calling for sanctions against Britain and ordering Abramovich to offload Chelsea to preserve the good name of the Kremlin.\nThis is the world in which sport finds itself embedded. What has changed is the hard edges of where this thing can lead are now very visible. If Shearer\u2019s paradox teaches us anything it is that you either see it and reject it en bloc; or it is probably best to keep quiet.",

        "content": "Premier League and UK government do not want sanctions on Roman Abramovich to destroy club but swift sale is required\nEverybody knew the sanctions were coming; they had been inevitable, according to UK government sources. Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, was in their crosshairs because of his links to Vladimir Putin, which had moved beyond the pale after Russia\u2019s senseless invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich himself knew they were coming. Hence his decision to try to sell his UK assets, including Chelsea.\nBut when they did arrive at 9am on Thursday, they were still able to blindside the Chelsea hierarchy. On Wednesday, they had certainly not anticipated the imposition of them the following morning. The club entered a state of shock. So many questions, so few answers. Some of the players were concerned about what the future held for them \u2013 given that one of the measures involved Chelsea not being able to operate in the transfer market or offer new contracts. Ditto many members of staff. What did it all mean?\nAs the day progressed, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, Richard Masters, sent an email to the clubs. It was still early, nothing felt concrete, but there was a business-as-usual tone to his note. Masters reassured everybody that Chelsea would complete their remaining fixtures of the season. The integrity of the competition would not be compromised and it was a theme picked up by Thomas Tuchel. \u201cAs long as we have enough shirts and as long as the bus is full of fuel we will arrive and we will be competitive,\u201d the Chelsea manager said.\nThe players have been told to concentrate on what they can influence, which they did on Thursday night with the 3-1 win at Norwich, keeping them third. Next is the visit of Newcastle to Stamford Bridge on Sunday which, it is fair to say, will be flavoured by ownership issues. But what kind of Chelsea will emerge from the sanctions which have set them on a path to ruin?\nThe first thing to say is that the world and European champions, who have won 21 trophies since Abramovich\u2019s takeover in 2003 \u2013 more than any other English club during the period \u2013 will surely not be put out of business, however hard the financial restrictions that have been brought against them appear.\nThere is still time to find a buyer and for them to stabilise the operation, especially if the deal were done by 31 May \u2013 when the club\u2019s special licence to carry on is due to expire. There remain plenty of interested parties, who can only see Chelsea\u2019s price dropping as sponsors pull out or consider their associations; as revenue streams are hit.\nMoreover, the government, which is effectively in charge of the sale \u2013 given the sanctions against Abramovich would not allow him to profit from it \u2013 have an interest in the transaction going through. They want Abramovich out for obvious reasons, including the optics, and they do not want to send Chelsea to the wall as they consider the club to be of cultural significance to the country. If Abramovich were to remain as the owner into next season, with sanctions biting ever deeper, that could happen.\nCould Abramovich dig in and take the ship down with him? Given everything we know about him and his love for Chelsea, his desire to hand over to responsible owners, it feels unlikely. And, in any case, the government have reserved the right to requisition the club, as a last resort, and sell it themselves. They have given Abramovich no room for manoeuvre, forcing him away, and, if there is financial pain for the club, it is at a level they believe they will get through.\nOn a related point, as Chelsea potentially encounter difficulties in satisfying the league\u2019s profit and sustainability rules, there does not seem to be a desire among the other clubs for them to be driven under. They recognise that a strong Chelsea is important for the collective brand. The league, meanwhile, is always loth to create a mess with points deductions, for example. Again, it is not good for the competition.\nIf Chelsea were to fall foul of profit and sustainability, they would be expected to cite unforeseen circumstances, much as some clubs have claimed Covid writedowns: their books would have been sound but for the pandemic.\nChelsea continue to try to process the sanctions and argue against some of them. Many areas of the business stand to be affected, with the government wanting to ensure that any revenue generated by the club cannot find its way back to the Putin regime.\nA part of the nervousness at Chelsea involves whether any more sponsors will follow the telecommunications and internet service provider Three in withdrawing support, at least temporarily. There are normally anti-embarrassment clauses in such arrangements and, from a corporate social responsibility point of view, the upside of standing by a tarnished individual is often outweighed by the downside.\nThe Three deal is worth \u00a340m a year, although it is unclear how much more, if anything, was due to Chelsea before the end of the season. The kit contract with Nike is the big one \u2013 it is worth \u00a360m a year.\nThe ticketing and merchandising sanctions should not hit too hard, as the end of the season looms, but there could be larger holes with the final portion of the broadcast deal and the prize money from the Premier League and Uefa to be frozen. If Chelsea were to finish third in the league, it would be worth about \u00a334m. Then there are the sums that Abramovich would be permitted to invest within the parameters of the profit and sustainability rules \u2013 \u00a3105m over a rolling three-year period. That, plainly, has stopped and so, to repeat, it is imperative that the transfer of ownership happens with a degree of speed.\nWhat is clear is that Chelsea will live a different reality without Abramovich and there is a strong chance that it will not be as exciting. In football terms, he was the ideal owner: no money constraints; an individual motivated purely by aggrandisement, to succeed year after year.\nAbramovich\u2019s day of reckoning has come. Chelsea have the memories and the conflicting emotions.",

        "content": "On the eve of the first Test, at the ground that carries his name, the great Sir Vivian Richards was asked about the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad but instead decided to largely ignore the question and deliver a hymn of praise for Zak Crawley.\n\u201cA magnificent player,\u201d purred Richards, urging England to give the 24-year-old time to flourish; to accept that, as a tall right-hander with an array of attacking shots at the top of the order, the first phase of his Test career may be hit and miss.\nThe talents that caught the eye of Richards were in evidence on the fourth day, Crawley strumming his second century for England that, along with 84 not out for Joe Root, gave England control of the match heading into the final day.\nThe tourists closed on 217 for one from 63.2 overs when rain lashed down at 5pm local time, having given themselves a sniff of victory through a lead of 153, even if the draw is clearly the heavy favourite on this moribund pitch.\nTrickier surfaces lie ahead but Crawley\u2019s elegant unbeaten 117 from 200 balls should do plenty for his confidence, having gone 21 innings without a three-figure score since his 267 against Pakistan in 2020. The smile upon reaching the milestone here, nudging Jayden Seales into the leg-side for two precious runs after tea and delighting the visiting supporters with it, suggested as much.\n\u201cIt means an awful lot,\u201d Crawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since my last one and there were times last year when I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get another. We are going to try and win the Test match. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll discuss but I think we\u2019ll want a minimum of 65-70 overs at them.\u201d\nAn unbroken second-wicket stand of 193 from 52.1 overs between Crawley and his captain also represented a boon for a top order that was shredded in Australia and last year found itself five down for 67 runs or fewer on eight occasions. So while conditions helped hugely, there was still pressure here.\nWinkling out the final West Indies wicket first thing \u2013 the hosts finally bowled out for 375 from 157 gruelling overs \u2013 England were staring at a deficit of 64 runs. In light of those recent struggles, one could not rule out the possibility of faces being left as red as some of those among the Barmy Army.\nThere was an inauspicious start to their innings too, Crawley\u2019s new opening partner, Alex Lees, seeing his Test debut end with scores of four and six. For the second time in the match, Kemar Roach followed a succession of outswingers to the left-hander with one that speared into his front pad.\nHaving seen seven decisions overturned by this point in the contest, Lees reviewed instantly but instead became the first England opener to make two single-figure scores on his debut since Hugh Morris in 1991; at least historical comfort can be drawn from the fact that the last Yorkshire-born cricketer on this list was one Len Hutton in 1937. He went OK.\nWith this came the end of England\u2019s third-highest opening partnership of the winter \u2013 just 24 runs \u2013 but Root strode out in his new position back at No 3 and soon quelled any concerns, with he and Crawley calmly pushing their side into the lead by lunch, reaching 72 for one, and then 146 for one by tea.\nThe runs came quicker than the previous day and the West Indies attack were left searching for answers once the ball went soft. Crawley was in murderous mood when they strayed, his 16 fours crisply struck either square of the wicket or behind, taking 100 balls to reach his half-century and then 81 more to double it. Even on a road, his execution was still reward for those present.\nIt was the left-arm spin of Axar Patel that led to Crawley\u2019s career stalling in India last year but with the pitch failing to break up here, his equivalent, Veerasammy Permaul, could offer no such threat. When Kraigg Brathwaite then started bowling his achingly slow off-spin from the other end, freebies were in abundance and both set batsmen helped themselves.\nHaving earlier overturned an lbw shout from Roach with the new ball, the only other heart in mouth moment came when Crawley was on 71 and a flick to leg off Permaul ended up in the hands of slip. West Indies went up, convinced it had struck his boot on the full before the catch. But with an on-field \u2018soft-signal\u2019 of not out, the TV umpire, Leslie Reifer, did not have conclusive evidence to give it.\nOtherwise it was a cruise for Crawley and Root, and perhaps a degree of vindication for the bowlers who 24 hours earlier had toiled in the absence of Mark Wood; a bit like Spike Milligan\u2019s epitaph on his gravestone: \u201cI told you I was ill\u201d.\nFor England there was still optimism that Wood may be able to bowl on the fifth day after the elbow injury that has sparked fears over his continuation in this three-Test series. Whether this would be wise, given the likelihood of a stalemate, is another matter.",

Last season when we wanted to qualify for the Champions League, we had to win all the games in the last weeks. We found ourselves quite frequently in similar situations. I don\u2019t know why it always happens to us. There was one year where we were champions [with games to spare]. All the others were full throttle to the end.\u201d\nLiverpool suffered only their third defeat in 53 matches in all competitions against Internazionale on Tuesday, albeit while progressing to the Champions League quarter-finals, and Klopp said: \u201cI give usually after a game a little speech in the dressing room.

Rashford did not start Sunday\u2019s 4-1 loss at Manchester City, which was the fourth consecutive league match he has been a substitute, though he was in the XI that drew at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid a fortnight ago. In all Rashford has made 10 starts and been a replacement four times under the German.\nWith Rashford having scored only five goals in 24 appearances this season, Rangnick was asked whether, as his recent lack of minutes is due to his poor form, it should be incumbent on the 24-year-old to show the manager what he can do. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he\u2019s not had enough game time,\u201d said the 63-year-old. \u201cHe\u2019s had 13-14 games since I\u2019ve been here now, he played more games from the start than he didn\u2019t play from the start.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is an issue and he never said anything about that since we spoke yesterday [Thursday]. But the [transfer] window is closed now. Even suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer. Now the window is closed. It\u2019s got nothing to do with tomorrow\u2019s game [v Tottenham] or the game on Tuesday [Atletico Madrid].\n\u201cI spoke with him yesterday and the day before so I don\u2019t know anything about him being unhappy. He didn\u2019t say anything to me, he said to me that he is still happy and that he wants to perform on a high level for the club. There was no mention of him not being happy here.\u201d\nCristiano Ronaldo has recovered from injury, the striker having flown to Portugal last weekend as he was not available for the City match. Rangnick was not aware the 37-year-old had done so.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about that trip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense now to waste energy and deal with it because the games we have to play now are too important. I decided to put my focus on the upcoming games and not waste any energy with things that happened in the last six or seven days.\u201d\nAsked if Ronaldo is happy at United, Rangnick said: \u201cI haven\u2019t asked him if he\u2019s happy at Manchester, at this club, he\u2019s fit again, resumed training yesterday and we shall see which formation we will line up with tomorrow.\u201d\nEdinson Cavani is also fit again following injury.",

I understand that if you are a fan of a club or work around a club and have seen it before then it is something that very easily can become really negative really quickly. And we can\u2019t be negative. That\u2019s my job now: to build players up and get them positive. Not be a cheerleader because there has to be some reality.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to build up players for no reason. But what I do see \u2013 and I\u2019m generalising \u2013 is a group of lads who do care. There is no doubt about that. We\u2019re 17th for a reason: before I got here. So we need to understand that I am not painting a pretty picture of a load of lads who care and it\u2019s all going to be fine, I\u2019m painting a picture that I know that they care but, proactively, what are they going to do about it?\u201d\nLampard realises that changing the team\u2019s reputation and bringing greater patience among fans is a long-term task, but in the short term he is encouraging his players to avoid the damning verdicts on social media unless they can cope with them.\n\u201cTo change that idea and culture is certainly something I want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy process. It doesn\u2019t come just from saying it and flicking a switch. Fortunately, I do not go on social media but the players do. If they are, they are going to have to deal with it and that is not easy. I remember I used to read the marks out of 10 in the newspapers 20 years ago when I was playing for England and I got five, and it was not nice at all. Now it is on a different level to that.\u201d",

        "content": "It was always clear in the aftermath of Emma Raducanu\u2019s US Open victory that it would take time for her to adjust to the rigours of professional tennis, a process that has defined the start of her season. After struggling with a series of different ailments, Raducanu arrived in Indian Wells still recovering from a left leg injury sustained in Guadalajara last month. Days before the BNP Paribas Open began, she was not certain of her participation.\nBut when Raducanu did step out on to the court on Friday, she was ready. The 19-year-old started by producing one of her best sets of tennis since New York and in the turbulent three-set match that followed, she toiled through to defeat Caroline Garcia 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 and reach the third round in Indian Wells.\nA reflection of the hype that still surrounds Raducanu came even before she played a single point. Despite Iga Swiatek, the third seed, and the former champion Simona Halep both competing on Friday, Raducanu was assigned the top Stadium 1 court ahead of them.\nShe immediately made the most of her high billing, breaking Garcia\u2019s serve in the opening game. Raducanu moved well from the beginning, soaked up Garcia\u2019s greater weight of shot and counterpunched efficiently, constantly stepping inside the baseline to flip points from defence to attack.\nHarriet Dart rallied from a set down at Indian Wells to defeat the former world No 3 Elina Svitolina of Ukraine and progress to the third round for the first time in her career. The 12th-seeded Ukrainian broke the Briton four times in the opening set at the BNP Paribas Open before Dart steadied herself in the second.\nThe British No 3, ranked 122nd, managed to break Svitolina three times consecutively to lead 5-3 then smashed a crucial ace to claim the set. Dart rushed out to a 3-0 lead in the decider but Svitolina scraped back some points before the match - which took two hours and 17 minutes - finished 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the qualifier's favour.\nKaia Kanepi will face Dart next after the Estonian needed just 81 minutes to upset 22nd seed Belinda Bencic 6-4, 6-3. Liam Broady, meanwhile, failed to progress past the first round despite taking a set off Miomir Kecmanovic. PA Media\nAs Garcia, a former world No 4 who has cascaded down the rankings in recent years, began to impose herself consistently, Raducanu struggled to keep up. Her first and second serve speeds both dropped significantly and her passivity allowed Garcia to seize the initiative. However Raducanu maintained her composure and, at a pivotal moment at the beginning of the third set, moved back inside the baseline and arrested Garcia\u2019s momentum with a great hold of serve before breezing to victory.\n\u201cAs soon as I let up and my racquet speed dropped, my ball speed dropped, she climbed on top of it straight away. I knew that I had to make some adjustments in the third set. I\u2019m really happy that I was able to work that out in the match and come through a tough one,\u201d Raducanu said.\nThe victory marks Raducanu\u2019s first WTA 1000 win and she has scuppered a run of five losses in six matches. Raducanu, who received a first round bye, will face the unseeded Petra Martic in the third round.\nEarlier in the day, Andy Murray pulled off a milestone victory in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open, clinching his 700th career ATP main draw win in a typically gritty match filled with resilience in absence of his top level. After losing the first set heavily and later trailing 3-1 in the final set, Murray recovered to defeat Taro Daniel of Japan 1-6, 6-2, 6-4. Murray will next face the 31st seed, Alexander Bublik of Kazhakstan.\nOnly 17 other men\u2019s players in the history of the sport have achieved 700 wins and only Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have achieved it among active players. \u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Murray told Amazon Prime. \u201cIt was a target I set myself towards the end of last year and with everything that has gone on the last few years it has not been easy to get there. Great achievement, not a lot of guys have been able to do that. I am really happy about it.\u201d",

        "content": "The jury ultimately believed the NT police officer\u2019s account of the killing of 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker. But while the trial is over, many matters remain unresolved\nDerek Williams was beside a grave in Yuendumu when he heard the news. He had just buried his uncle.\n\u201cA young fellow came rushing down and told us that Kumanjayi was shot,\u201d Williams told the Northern Territory supreme court last month.\nWilliams is an Aboriginal community police officer and Kumanjayi Walker\u2019s uncle.\nWilliams had arrested his 19-year-old nephew a few times and there had never been trouble; he said Walker usually agreed to go with him as he was family.\nBut on the night of 9 November 2019 an attempted arrest of Walker had gone horribly wrong. Walker had stabbed constable Zachary Rolfe, an officer from out of town, with scissors. Rolfe had then shot him three times.\nWhile Williams was at his uncle\u2019s grave, Walker had been sitting outside a Yuendumu property known as house 511. He was with Leanne Oldfield, the woman who adopted him as her son, and her husband Nathan Coulthard.\nWalker was laughing at a family photo of his two small cousins and an aunt in a swimming pool. He then got up and walked through the only door into the house, Oldfield told the court.\nSoon after, Oldfield said she saw police coming through the gate.\n\u201cThey was walking really quickly [and] I seen the guns.\u201d\nWalker may not have seen the police approaching, but he knew they were coming. Twelve days earlier, he had left a residential alcohol treatment program in Alice Springs that he had been ordered by a court to attend as part of a suspended sentence. He had also removed an electronic monitoring device.\nThree days before those police arrived, he had been at house 577 in Yuendumu with his girlfriend, Rickisha Robertson, when two local officers arrived. They wanted to arrest him for breaching his suspended sentence.\nWalker rushed out of a bedroom with a small axe held high above his head, threatening the officers, before fleeing.\nThe officers gave chase, before returning to the house.\n\u201cNext time he does that, he might get shot,\u201d one of the officers, senior constable first class Christopher Hand, told Lottie Robertson, Rickisha\u2019s grandmother, when he returned.\n\u201cIn Alice Springs \u2026 like, community policeman are different to town policeman.\u201d\nAt 3pm the next day, in Alice Springs, Rolfe started his shift. He checked his emails, and noticed a report about the so-called axe incident in Yuendumu. Then he accessed body-worn camera footage taken from Hand and the other officer who had been there, Lanyon Smith.\nRolfe told the court that he thought the report about the incident bore little resemblance to the violence depicted in the videos.\nRolfe formed the opinion Walker was \u201cextremely violent\u201d and had the potential to use \u201clethal weapons\u201d against police.\nHe thought Walker\u2019s arrest was the sort of job that required the deployment of the Immediate Response Team (IRT), a semi-tactical unit made up of general duties police officers who received specialised training and could access weaponry including AR-15s and beanbag shotguns. Rolfe had been a member of the team for almost two years.\nLater that day, Rolfe and other officers on the general duties roster decided to search a house in Warlpiri camp, Alice Springs, where Walker had been known to stay.\nThere did not appear to be anyone home, but one of Rolfe\u2019s colleagues saw two young Aboriginal men running into scrub behind the property. Neither of them was Walker. Rolfe can be heard saying on his body-worn camera about one of the men: \u201cfucking pussy cunt\u201d.\nIn Yuendumu, local officers were trying to talk to Walker\u2019s family and arrange his surrender. The local sergeant, Julie Frost, made a deal with Walker\u2019s family that he would not be arrested until after the funeral of Williams\u2019 uncle, but that when it was finished he had to hand himself in.\nSome time after the axe incident but before the funeral, though Louanna Williams cannot remember the day, Walker, her nephew, visited her. She was cooking a kangaroo tail on the fire at house 548.\nWilliams gave evidence that Walker told her he was not responsible for a series of break-ins in Yuendumu. Frost had thought him a suspect, but had no proof.\nWalker also said he never wanted to hurt anyone during the axe incident, but just wanted to escape the house, and told Williams he wanted to be arrested after the funeral \u201cbecause he knew that he was in trouble\u201d.\nBy this time, there were other concerns in Yuendumu, Frost told the court: the break-ins had led medical workers to evacuate Yuendumu, local officers had been deployed elsewhere, and there was unrest in a nearby remote community.\nThe influx of people for the funeral, which had been delayed until 9 November, could also complicate things, she reckoned. Frost had also decided that as she was in a relationship with Hand, neither of them, nor Smith, should be involved in the arrest of Walker, to avoid any possibility his treatment would be perceived as payback for the axe incident. And she was tired. So she sent a request for more coppers.\nOn the afternoon of 9 November, Rolfe received a phone call about half an hour before his shift was supposed to start from the acting sergeant of the IRT, Shane McCormack.\nMcCormack was in the process of rounding up people to deploy to Yuendumu, after Frost\u2019s request had been approved.\nHe found four IRT officers, who met up at Alice Springs station. A dog handler would go with them too.\nSome of those officers had not seen the axe incident, so Rolfe showed them on his computer. One of the officers, constable Adam Eberl, said Walker was lucky he hadn\u2019t been shot.\nThey packed their swags and other gear, including camouflage uniforms, and set off through the desert to Yuendumu, about 300km away. Within minutes, they had no mobile phone reception, and the final part of their journey was on unpaved roads.\nRolfe arrived in Yuendumu with constable James Kirstenfeldt about 6.30pm, and introduced himself to Frost. The other officers were all in the station together within half an hour.\nWhat was discussed during the roughly half hour that Rolfe was in the station is a matter of some dispute. But a few things are clear: the officers were told by Frost that police did not know where Walker was, that he could be arrested the following morning, but if they came across him that night they should lock him up.\nRolfe and the other officers left Yuendumu station at 7.06pm. They decided to head straight to house 577, the scene of the axe incident, to find out if Walker was there.\nEthan Robertson told Rolfe that Walker and Robertson\u2019s daughter Rickisha had only left minutes earlier for either house 511 or 518.\nThe officers drive to houses 518 and 511, which are next to each other, on the other side of the Yuendumu football oval from house 577.\nRolfe speaks politely to people outside the houses, asking them to come closer so he can ask them questions about Walker.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Zach, we\u2019re new in town,\u201d he says at one point. \u201cWe\u2019re here to pick up [Kumanjayi] eh?\u201d\nWhen he is in the yard of house 511, Eberl says he notices a young man inside.\nSeconds earlier, Walker had walked inside. He appears to be on his way back outside when Eberl, followed by Rolfe, step in.\nWalker, his face illuminated by the torches of the officers, stares at them blankly from under a red New York Yankees cap.\nHe is asked his name, and says he\u2019s Vernon Dixon, and points outside, saying \u201cshe\u2019s my auntie\u201d.\nRolfe ushers him to a wall of the house, not far from the door. He wants Walker to keep his hat off so he can identify him. Rolfe takes his phone from his pocket, finds a photo on it of Walker, and holds the phone up to his face.\nAfter a quick comparison, Rolfe is convinced he has his man. He asks Walker to put his hands behind his back. But he has not noticed Walker\u2019s right hand reaching into his pocket for a pair of scissors.\nWalker launches at Rolfe. The pair struggle, with Rolfe stabbed on the top of the left shoulder as he uses that same arm to jab Walker.\nEberl and Walker start moving in the other direction from Rolfe, with Eberl, a much larger man with extensive martial arts training, attempting to use both arms to control Walker.\nRolfe fires his first shot, striking Walker in the back.\nWalker and Eberl fall on a mattress on the ground and continue to struggle.\nRolfe heads towards them. Eberl is at least partially on top of Walker, but they are still moving. The scissors, and Walker\u2019s right arm, which was holding them, cannot be seen on the camera footage.\nRolfe puts his left hand on Eberl\u2019s lower back. He extends his right arm so that the barrel of his gun is within five centimetres of Walker. And he pulls the trigger twice more.\nIt had been less than an hour since he arrived in Yuendumu, 15 minutes from when he left the station.\nBy the time Derek Williams made his way from his uncle\u2019s grave into town, Walker was dying on the floor of the Yuendumu police station. The second bullet fired by Rolfe had ripped through his spleen, a lung, his liver and a kidney. Outside the station, a crowd was gathering, angry and wanting answers about why the young Warlpiri man had been shot by police.\n\u201cPeople was yelling and screaming and wanted to throw rocks at the station, and yeah, I just calmed everybody down,\u201d Williams told the court.\nFour days later, Rolfe was charged with Walker\u2019s murder.\nRolfe, 30, spent most of his five-week trial appearing utterly at ease. He would occasionally greet friends with a shaka when he entered the court. While waiting to enter the courtroom he would speak to his parents, Debbie and Richard, but more often to his friends, or the executive of the police unions that were a constant presence: the NT Police Association and Police Federation of Australia.\nRolfe was charged in relation to the second and third shots. The second was fired 2.6 seconds after the first, and the third 0.5 seconds later.\nThe trial was, at its core, a dispute about what occurred during those 3.1 seconds.\nIt was therefore not surprising that the body-worn camera footage of the shooting was played countless times in real time, slow-motion and frame-by-frame. In real time, the sound of the incident boomed through court room two of the NT supreme court.\nAs the prosecution and defence raked over it in detail, the more ambiguous it became, something of an optical illusion where two people looking at the same picture might see entirely different things. Watch the body-worn camera footage of Zachary Rolfe and what do you see? A police officer doing his job? Or a murderer?\nWhat mattered most, however, was what Rolfe could see. As Judge John Burns said in his directions to the jury, \u201cthe important question may well turn out to be what was the perception, rather than the reality\u201d.\nRolfe had said in his evidence he felt he had to pull the trigger the second and third time as he thought Walker was stabbing Eberl.\nThe prosecutor, Philip Strickland SC, believed the jury had enough reason to find Rolfe was lying about what he said he had seen. It was not shown on the camera footage. Rolfe told the court Walker put his hand on his police gun, but never told anyone that at the time. And Rolfe said \u201cit\u2019s all good, he was stabbing me, he was stabbing you\u201d immediately after the incident, Strickland said, not to reassure Eberl, as claimed, but because he knew he had been \u201cgung ho\u201d, \u201cgone too far\u201d and wanted to \u201cjustify the unjustifiable\u201d.\nHe also wanted to portray Rolfe, who spent five years in the army, applied to join the SAS, and paid for his own private security course in the US to \u201cupskill\u201d himself with weapons and tactical training prior to joining the NT police, as someone who sought out \u201cdirect action\u201d jobs, such as the arrest of high-risk targets like Walker.\nDavid Edwardson QC, Rolfe\u2019s barrister, who, like his entire legal team, was paid for by the NT Police Association, dismissed these claims, and made clear to the jury that he believed Rolfe should not even be on trial.\n\u201cThis case is tragic,\u201d Edwardson said in his closing address.\n\u201cA young man lost his life, and a young courageous police officer has been charged with the most serious offence under the criminal justice system \u2026 without any proper investigation, and that is a disgrace.\u201d\nThe jury, which did not include any Indigenous people, ultimately believed Rolfe\u2019s account.\nOn Friday, almost exactly 24 hours after retiring to consider their verdict, the jury returned to a packed courtroom.\nWhen the foreperson delivered the last of three not guilty verdicts, Rolfe stood alone in the dock for a moment, before he was swamped by supporters, to the point there was a line of people wanting to hug him or shake his hand.\n\u201cObviously I think that was the right decision to make, but a lot of people are hurting today, Kumanjayi\u2019s family and his community,\u201d Rolfe said outside court.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to leave this space for them.\u201d\nHe was asked about whether he would stay in the force, and did not respond.\nWhile the trial has finished, many matters remain unresolved.\nEdwardson, in reference to issues that cannot be reported in a case that remains bound by many suppression orders, said that \u201cconsequences would flow\u201d now that a verdict had been reached.\nStrickland pointed towards a coronial inquest, expected to start later this year, as a way of exploring issues raised by the shooting that were not ventilated during the trial.\nThere was something else that could never be resolved by the trial, regardless of the outcome: the grief of Walker\u2019s family, the Yuendumu community, and Aboriginal people wondering why they continue to die at the hands of police.\nThose who were there for the verdict questioned why the jury contained no Aboriginal people, and why guns were still allowed in remote communities.\nThey mentioned the Aboriginal man, the same age as Walker, who was shot at six times by police in Palmerston, just south of Darwin, on Tuesday, and remains in a critical condition.\nNed Jampinjinpa Hargreaves, a Warlpiri elder, shouted outside court, before bursting into tears: \u201cWhen are we going to get justice?

The attack on Odesa, a crucial port city in the south, has also stalled, and Russian land advances have been thwarted repeatedly.\nMore than a week ago, Russia admitted that almost 500 of its soldiers had been killed, a figure that has not since been updated, while US officials estimate that between 5,000 and 6,000 Russian troops have died.\n\u201cThe current problems should be traced back to the inception of this war, which was conducted in high secrecy to avoid any leaks,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s disastrous move to invade was rooted in giant lapses of expertise about Ukraine,\u201d said Gabuev, who added that officials close to Putin who helped plan the invasion sincerely believed that many Ukrainians would welcome Russian soldiers, and that the country\u2019s leadership would offer little resistance.\n\u201cOnly a very small group of generals were informed about the war, and they didn\u2019t ask difficult questions that could help prepare for any scenarios other than a speedy Russian victory.\n\u201cThe whole war planning was reduced to a clandestine operation developed by just a handful of people in uniform \u2013 and the president himself,\u201d said Gabuev.\nReports from captured Russian soldiers, as well as leaked audio conversations between the Russian military, have indicated that much of the army was not informed of the invasion until the last moment.\nRussia also appears to have underestimated how united the west would be in the face of the invasion.\n\u201cThe Kremlin might have not anticipated just how toxic Russia would become in the eyes of the west,\u201d said Maria Shagina, an international sanctions specialist at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.\nShagina said that while the Kremlin expected sanctions, it has probably been surprised by the speed and unity with which the west and major multinational corporations have cut ties with Russia.\nGiven the military and political setbacks, hints have emerged over the last few days that Putin may retract some of his initial far-reaching diplomatic demands, including his commitment to pushing through regime change in Ukraine.\nOn Monday, Putin\u2019s trusted spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Reuters that Russia was ready to halt military operations if Kyiv meets its list of conditions. Those terms would require Ukraine to cease military action, enshrine neutrality in its constitution, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The demands omitted to mention the \u201cdenazification\u201d of the Ukrainian leadership, previously flagged by Putin as the main motivation for the invasion.\nHowever, most analysts and western officials believe that an eventual Russian military victory remains the most realistic scenario given its overwhelming military power.\nDespite the setbacks it has experienced, Russian forces have been regrouping north-west of the Ukrainian capital, in what western intelligence has said could be preparation for an assault on Kyiv. Russian forces have also surrounded the strategically important cities Kharkiv and Mariupol, which have come under increasingly intense bombardment.\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to make a breakthrough during ceasefire talks in the Turkish city of Antalya on Thursday, suggesting that Russia is not rushing to find a solution to the war.\nAnd while some in the west have pinned their hopes on Russia\u2019s business and political elites stopping the war, experts in Russia generally agree that the invasion has not yet affected Putin\u2019s grip on power.\n\u201cElites have been silenced. While many are opposed to this war, none are expected to speak out,\u201d said Stanovaya.\nThere has been some quiet grumbling among some of the country\u2019s richest citizens who have lost millions following western sanctions. Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to Putin, has raised alarm in a series of public posts about the war\u2019s economic consequences for Russia.\nBut Deripaska and others have been careful to not criticise Putin directly.\nMeanwhile, some senior officials also look to be taken aback by the invasion.\nAccording to a report by the well-connected Russian journalist Farida Rustamova, \u201cthe mood in the corridors of power is not at all happy. Many are in a state of near-paralysis.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the Kommersant business news outlet reported that the influential head of Russia\u2019s central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, was considering resigning.\nA source close to Nabiullina confirmed to the Guardian that the central bank head had considered leaving her post.\n\u201cNabiullina has thought of resigning ever since the war started. But it would have direct consequences for her and her family,\u201d the source said.\nBut even if the political and business elites did openly revolt, questions remain about what real power they have over Putin, who has increasingly surrounded himself with former KGB agents and old friends as the pandemic increased his isolation.\n\u201cThe only people who could make a difference are those in uniform that command real soldiers like [minister of defence] Sergei Shoigu and [chief of the general staff of the armed forces] Valery Gerasimov,\u201d said Gabuev.\n\u201cBut those men were directly involved in the preparation for the invasion. While they might not be happy about the scale of the current conflict, they have too much to lose to do something at this stage. They are also implicated,\u201d Gabuev added.",

        "content": "The Russian game is set to get more than a taste of what Iran, North Korea and Myanmar have been dealing with\nThere have in the past been casual mentions in Asian football of how Russia would be welcome in the confederation to really give the continent a sense of geographical completeness. This addition would mean a different conversation now but in the meantime if Moscow wants to see what football life can be like under sanctions then a visit to famous Asian cities such as Tehran, Pyongyang and Yangon would be timely.\nThe Iranian Football Federation has been wrestling with US-imposed restrictions for years, even if they are not as strict as the measures taken against Russia. Sanctions made headlines before the 2018 World Cup when Nike found itself unable to supply the team with boots, but there are more serious consequences. Swift, the financial system that enables money to move smoothly between international accounts, has been denied to Russian banks. Iran have had problems receiving their payments from Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation.\nIn December 2019, Iran\u2019s sport minister, Masoud Soltanifar, blamed this for the then national team coach, Marc Wilmots, getting paid late. \u201cUnfortunately, due to unfair sanctions, Fifa cannot pay Iran\u2019s revenues without the permission of the US Department of the Treasury and the Iranian federation was forced to borrow money from a domestic company to pay the salary of the national team head coach,\u201d he said. Other foreign coaches and players have left due to similar problems. Being on the international naughty step has also made it harder to attract decent international opposition to Tehran for friendlies and harder for Iran to pay for much-needed training camps overseas.\nInternationally, things may not look too bad with the national team having qualified for a third World Cup in succession with games to spare but, domestically, there are major problems of which sanctions may not be the cause but do make finding solutions more difficult. The two biggest clubs in the country, debt-ridden Persepolis and Esteghlal, were thrown out of the 2022 Asian Champions League in January for both being owned by the Ministry of Youth and Sport.\nThere has been talk and promises of privatisation for years but there is just no money in Iranian football to attract investors even if there was the political will to relinquish control of such popular institutions. The national broadcast revenue of about \u00a33.5m is spread across the whole league, as well as other sports. It is no surprise that club officials lament the difficulty of receiving transfer fees for players, the development of which is still a strength of Iran.\nNorth Korea are no strangers to isolation and, as the decision to withdraw from 2022 World Cup qualification shows, have been known to sanction themselves. They have forged their own path that lies between the desire for a form of football juche, or self-sufficiency, and the recognition that there has to be at least some outside engagement.\nAfter three defeats at the 2010 World Cup, the upper echelons of the party took a closer interest and decided that more exposure to the global game was needed. The Pyongyang International Football School was opened soon after with coaches imported from Spain. The students were hand-picked from schools around the country and those who continued to impress in the capital were sent to academies in Italy and Spain.\nThe best of the bunch that won the 2014 Asia Under-16 Championship was Han Kwang-song. He went on to play for Cagliari, Perugia and, for a short time, Juventus, before being sold to Al-Duhail of Qatar. The North Korean Ronaldo\u2019s international career was derailed, however, amid reports that much of his salary was being sent back to the government in Pyongyang, in contravention of UN sanctions. The same thing ended Choe Song-hyok\u2019s time with Fiorentina in 2016.\nMyanmar do not have such problems of players earning big bucks overseas. Since last year\u2019s military coup, there is not that much football to speak of with many players reportedly returning to their home provinces to get ready to fight the junta. Football leaders do know plenty about sanctions, with their FA chief, Zaw Zaw, specifically targeted by the European Union in the last decade. The Yangon United owner, U Tay Za, has been similarly hit, including by the UK government last September for, among other things, supplying weapons to the military. The tycoon\u2019s bottom line has been affected, which leaves little for football.\nThere were attempts to attract Chinese investment but this is a time when Beijing looks much less favourably than before on money leaving the country to line the pockets of foreign players, agents and clubs, though at least Tay Za was thankful for his Chinese-made smartphone that helped him survive a 2011 helicopter crash when he was stranded for four days at an altitude of 15,000 feet.\nRussian football officials are unlikely to face such drama but, in the absence of a move to Asia, the day-to-day challenges of operating when it is hard to collect money and play games should be enough to be going on with.",

Does this one offer you something substantial you don\u2019t get from those ones? Which one can you live without to make room for a newcomer? Or are you willing to simply add it to the growing pile?\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nWith all this in mind, StudioCanal\u2019s new platform, StudioCanal Presents, has a stronger selling point than most. In its 34-year history, the Paris-based distributor and production company has built up one of the largest film libraries in the world, digging into the vaults of everything from Ealing Studios to Studio Ghibli. StudioCanal Presents, available for \u00a34.99 via the Apple TV app (with a week-long free trial for the wary), has been built to show off those wares. It launched recently with a selection of more than 100 titles from its library, with more to be added on a monthly basis, many of them exclusive to the platform.\nIts starter pack, as it were, is a pretty indicative cross-section of what its archive has to offer, spanning crowdpleasers and art films, classics and newer favourites, with British and French cinema \u2013 per the company\u2019s origins \u2013 particularly well represented in the international mix. StudioCanal\u2019s selection of British classics includes plenty of rightly canonised titles: the eternally jittery, shivery noir of Carol Reed\u2019s The Third Man, the foxy comedy of Ealing stalwarts Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers, the still-startling candour of Ken Loach\u2019s debut feature, Poor Cow, or the nervy, sensual modernism of Nicolas Roeg\u2019s endlessly imitated psychological horror Don\u2019t Look Now.\nBut I was pleased to find a few films that aren\u2019t celebrated today as much as they deserve to be. Bryan Forbes\u2019s lovely, quietly compassionate 1962 adaptation of Lynne Reid Banks\u2019s The L-Shaped Room, about a young pregnant Frenchwoman seeking allies in a west London boarding house, still rings perceptively true in its depiction of the mixed messages Britain gives to new arrivals. From the same era of new British realism, Guy Green\u2019s The Angry Silence probes labour politics and working-class financial despair with a determined vigour \u2013 interpreted as anti-strike in its day \u2013 that could still prompt debate now. Moving away from realism entirely, there\u2019s rainy-Sunday teatime escapism in the lavishly camp, star-encrusted 1970s version of Agatha Christie\u2019s Death on the Nile, should you want a corrective to the wooden Kenneth Branagh take currently in cinemas.\nCrossing the Channel, the French New Wave gets a look-in, with Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s form-changing Breathless, Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment\u2019s icy yet sun-scorched Ripley tale Purple Noon and Alain Resnais\u2019s dreamily deconstructed romance Last Year at Marienbad among the selections. At the more recent end of French culture, the compulsive, suitably twisty policier series Spiral is a highlight of the platform\u2019s TV selection, along with the louche, bespoke-tailored nastiness of Hannibal, the 2013 Hannibal Lecter origin series with an ideally cast Mads Mikkelsen, well worth bingeing for the first or 14th time.\nLatter-day cinema selections range from the brash gangster spectacle of Tom Hardy\u2019s dual Kray brothers performance in Legend to Steven Soderbergh\u2019s underrated, southern-fried heist romp Logan Lucky to the perverse, tar-dark Korean woman-on-a-mission mystery of Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Mother \u2013 every bit the equal of the director\u2019s more popular Parasite. And should you somehow have missed two of the essential American films of the past decade \u2013 the Coen brothers\u2019 wintry, elegiac folk throwback Inside Llewyn Davis and Todd Haynes\u2019s all-time romantic swoon Carol \u2013 a double feature of those is worth the month\u2019s fiver already.\nHuman Rights Watch film festival \n  The travelling international festival of progressive, socially conscious cinema holds its London edition from 17-25 March, with the entire programme also available to stream digitally in the UK and Ireland during that time. It\u2019s a fresh, exciting selection of documentary and narrative work: highlights include the recently Berlin-awarded Myanmar Diaries \u2013 an urgent, searing journal by anonymous film-makers of the past year under military rule \u2013 and Eternal Spring, an inspired mixed-media reflection on Chinese police persecution of Falun Gong activists, its lively animation drawn from the comic-book aesthetic of exiled artist Daxiong.\nLa Civil (Signature) \n When her teenage daughter is kidnapped by a cartel and the authorities in northern Mexico prove no help, single mother Cielo takes matters into her own hands. That premise may make Teodora Mihai\u2019s arresting debut sound like a standard-issue vigilante thriller, but it\u2019s something else altogether: tensely riveting, yes, but rich in social texture as it ponders a national history of violence.\nFeast (Mubi) \n Dutch director Tim Leyendekker\u2019s radical, haunting hybrid documentary takes as its subject a case that could be vulnerable to lurid true crime treatment, in which three Dutch men held a series of sex parties where guests were drugged and injected with HIV-infected blood. But Leyendekker avoids sensationalism, instead probing emotional motivations from multiple perspectives over the course of seven reconstructed vignettes.",

        "content": "The star of Free Solo is back with a new series featuring terrifying climbs \u2013 this time using virtual reality \nThe great promise of virtual reality lies in its potential to replicate otherwise unattainable experiences. And few in the physical world can match the experiences of Alex Honnold, the American rock climber who has distinguished himself with ropeless ascents up some of the world\u2019s most fearsome cliffs.\nNo one had ever completed a \u201cfree-solo\u201d climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park before Honnold famously did so in 2017, a feat that was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary.\nNow comes another film about Honnold, one that takes viewers as close they will probably ever get to the hair-raising exploits that have made him a rock star.\nThe new virtual reality series, Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR, invites you to tag along as he embarks on free-solo climbs in the Italian and French Alps. Strap on a headset, and you\u2019re immersed in a panorama of sky, snow and rock. Crane your head upward to watch as Honnold navigates his way to the summit. Peer over your shoulder, and you\u2019re met with a sweeping view of wilderness. Look down, and \u2013 well, maybe don\u2019t look down.\nThe two-part series, which was released last week, offers up plenty of mind-blowing scenery. But it could be difficult viewing for some, and not just because it\u2019s only available on Meta\u2019s line of Quest VR headsets.\n\u201cI think for some people it might be one of the most intense things they\u2019ve ever watched,\u201d Honnold tells the Guardian. \u201cEven when I\u2019m watching I\u2019m like, \u2018This is a lot.\u2019 I did the actual climbs and it still feels pretty intense.\u201d\nHonnold said even his family of climbers has only been able to consume the two half-hour episodes in \u201csmall doses.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re really struggling to watch the whole film because it really puts them there,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s almost too much for them.\u201d\nThe Soloist was directed by Jonathan Griffith, a filmmaker who specializes in shooting mountain sports. An alpinist himself, Griffith says virtual reality is the \u201cmost powerful way to bring people into my world of climbing.\u201d\n\u201cI really fell in love with VR because the whole thing that motivates me in my work is to bring people into my world of the high mountains \u2013 the Himalayas, the Alps or wherever,\u201d Griffith says. \u201cYou\u2019re putting humans in these alien looking worlds, and it\u2019s completely crazy. I love taking photos of that and sharing them with the world.\u201d\nGriffith wisely eschewed music in the production, allowing viewers to take in all the raw, ambient sounds of Honnold\u2019s climbs. At the end of the first episode, with Honnold on a free solo climb in the Dolomites, he pauses to tie his shoe. And suddenly, it\u2019s just you and him on the precipice, both sharing a sublime view of the Italian Alps amid the unmatched stillness of nature. If you can avoid any bouts of vertigo \u2013 and you have access to the necessary hardware \u2013 the series is worth checking out for moments like that.\n\u201cThe thing that I love about soloing is being in these incredible places and having these powerful experiences,\u201d Honnold says. \u201cIn the VR film, the scenes are long enough so the viewer can look around a little bit and get a taste of what I love about those places.\u201d\nHonnold, 36, is still feeling the aftereffects of his triumph at El Capitan. The historic, ropeless climb of Yosemite\u2019s famous monolith of granite was chronicled in Free Solo, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2019 and brought Honnold even more fame. In January, he joined a long line of celebrities to make cameos on the Showtime series Billions. Honnold says he gets recognized in public more since the release of the documentary, which has also generated more commercial opportunities and increased exposure to his solar energy foundation.\n\u201cBasically everything has been turned up quite a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the heart of it, [the fame] hasn\u2019t really changed the things that matter the most. I\u2019m still climbing five days a week. I\u2019m still spending my time on projects that are exciting to me.\u201d\nFree Solo served as a window into what makes Honnold tick, and what it\u2019s like to be in his orbit. Audiences saw his singularity of focus in his push to conquer El Cap, as well as the anxiety the pursuit brought to his friends. Throughout the film, Honnold wrestles with his personal life, openly wondering if a budding romance will compromise his climbing goals. In one scene, he and his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, discuss whether a family might cause him to recalibrate his capacity for risk.\nSince then, Honnold and McCandless have gotten married. Last month, they welcomed the birth of their first child.\n\u201cI was always expecting to go through the full range of adulthood at some point,\u201d Honnold says. \u201cI always wanted to have a family eventually. I always wanted a stable relationship. It\u2019s all according to plan.\u201d\nSpeaking by phone as he holds his newborn daughter, June, Honnold says that his expanded family hasn\u2019t caused him to rein in his ambitions, noting that he completed the free-solo climbs for the VR series during his wife\u2019s pregnancy.\nHe didn\u2019t climb for a week following the birth, as June remained in the hospital to receive treatment for now-resolved medical complications.\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m coming out of that, I\u2019ve actually been feeling heroically strong,\u201d Honnold says. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s just a byproduct of fatherhood.\u201d",

With the Wailing Wall serving as an evocative backdrop, the Russian oligarch stood shoulder to shoulder with her as they posed happily for photographs beneath a searing Levantine sun. \u201cIt was a wonderful, brilliant, self-reflective day,\u201d said Chelsea\u2019s manager. \u201cThe experience was immensely spiritual for everyone. It\u2019s brought us closer together and reinforced the value of taking care of each other. Roman spending time with us in Israel meant an awful lot.\u201d\nThree years ago, few of those staring up at the Mount of Olives could have envisaged the geopolitical train hurtling down the track towards them. Back then, Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine seemed almost inconceivable. The idea the British government would impose sanctions on Abramovich, placing Chelsea in paralysing limbo as his UK assets were frozen, would have been dismissed as fanciful by those wary of mentioning the litigious owner\u2019s ties with Putin.\nSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2022/03/10-54431-gnl.fw.20220310.jg.psgchampionsleaguecollapseagain.mp3\nAs the only manager to have survived a full decade during Abramovich\u2019s regime, Hayes was closer than most to the enigmatic Russian who once enjoyed deep dinner table conversations with Rafael Ben\u00edtez but, particularly in recent years, has often distanced himself from his men\u2019s team managers. Significantly, last May, Chelsea\u2019s owner entered the dressing room in Gothenburg to commiserate with Hayes\u2019s players after their 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final. Touched, the manager pledged to win the trophy one day \u201cfor Roman\u201d and could not possibly have imagined her world would implode 10 months on.\nArguably the most talented coach in the domestic women\u2019s game is striving to preserve the empire Abramovich\u2019s money helped her create at Kingsmeadow. Since arriving at Chelsea in 2012 and surviving an early relegation scare Hayes has played a key role in transforming the entire topography of elite female football in England. After leading her side to a first Women\u2019s Super League title in 2015 she has recaptured the trophy three times, while also celebrating a trio of FA Cup triumphs and twice winning the League Cup.\nAlong the way Chelsea raised the collective bar, a desire not to be upstaged persuading other leading clubs, most notably Manchester City and Manchester United, to invest heavily in their women\u2019s teams. Anxious not to be left behind, Newcastle have pledged to build a female side that will challenge for silverware.\nGiven that leading players in the fully professional WSL can earn up to \u00a3250,000 a year, it is quite a commitment. Tellingly, though, Chelsea\u2019s success opened rival clubs\u2019 eyes to the female game\u2019s previously untapped commercial potential.\nWSL sides are now studded with overseas talent but it was Hayes who made the first marquee foreign signing with her acquisition of the South Korea midfielder Ji So-yun in 2014. Ji was the women\u2019s game\u2019s answer to Lionel Messi and her arrival paved the way for numerous imports. Typically, Chelsea set a world record female transfer fee when they paid Wolfsburg about \u00a3300,000 for the Denmark forward Pernille Harder in 2020.\nChelsea kick off at home to Aston Villa on Sunday in second, five points behind the leaders, Arsenal, but with two games in hand. For the moment, though, the music has stopped at Kingsmeadow, where only season-ticket holders will be admitted, at least for now, after the ban on general ticket sales. While Hayes frets about losing a quartet who will be out of contract in the summer \u2013 Maren Mjelde, Jonna Andersson, Ji and Drew Spence \u2013 Kingsmeadow regulars fear Abramovich\u2019s eventual successor may be disinclined to invest in their side.\nAfter all, a Liverpool board obsessed with bolstering J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s ambitions allowed a female team that won successive titles in 2013 and 2014 to slip into second-tier obscurity two years ago. Similarly, the FA demoted Sunderland two divisions in 2018 when the billionaire Ellis Short sold up and the financial taps were turned off.\nOnly time will tell if Chelsea\u2019s moment in the sun is over but, whatever happens, Hayes has already left an indelible impression on the women\u2019s game, changing it virtually beyond recognition.",

        "content": "Candidates for secretary of state are raising huge sums after Trump\u2019s lies shook 2020 election\nLast year, Brad Raffensperger was attracting national headlines for taking a stand against Donald Trump and his lies about the 2020 election.\nIn a phone call that was quickly made public, Trump demanded that Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to deprive Joe Biden of a victory in the battleground state. Raffensperger refused to do so and won widespread praise for his courage.\nRaffensperger is paying for his actions in a way that reveals how his once obscure elected position is now at the center of a battle for the future of American democracy \u2013 and attracting all the big money and political heat that entails.\nThis year, Raffensperger is facing a brutal primary race against a Trump-backed candidate, the US congressman Jody Hice, and trying to cling on to his job. Hice, who has said the 2020 results in Georgia would have been different if the race had been \u201cfair\u201d, has already raised more than twice as much money as Raffensperger.\nHice\u2019s impressive haul is partly thanks to the unusually high number of out-of-state donations that his campaign has attracted, as more Americans across the country zero in on secretary of state races.\nAnd Georgia is not unique. As Trump and his allies continue to spread the \u201cbig lie\u201d of widespread fraud in the 2020 race, many voters are focusing their attention \u2013 and wallets \u2013 on the officials who oversee states\u2019 elections.\nSecretary of state candidates in both parties are now posting substantial fundraising figures, intensifying concerns over how election administration has become a heated political issue in the US.\nSecretary of state races have historically attracted little notice and even less money. The winners of these elections assume rather bureaucratic roles, and their duties may include managing state records, overseeing the department of motor vehicles and keeping the state seal. But in many states, the secretary of state also serves \u2013 crucially \u2013 as the chief election official.\nIn the weeks after the 2020 election, as Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the results had been tainted by fraud, secretaries of state in key battleground states became the target of intimidation and threats. Now the former president is using the power of his endorsement to wield influence in the races for those posts.\nWhile Trump did not endorse any candidates for secretary of state in 2020, he has already endorsed three in the 2022 cycle: Hice in Georgia, Mark Finchem in Arizona and Kristina Karamo in Michigan. All three candidates have embraced the lie that Democrats stole the 2020 election by allowing fraud to affect the results. Biden\u2019s margin of victory in each of those states was less than three points, and their input could prove decisive in the next presidential election.\n\u201cThey are willing to overturn the will of the voters in order to choose the winner,\u201d said Kim Rogers, executive director of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. \u201cIt is disempowering, and it is akin to giving an arsonist keys to the firehouse.\u201d\nRepublicans and Democrats\u2019 disparate concerns over election fairness have contributed to a significant increase in donations to secretary of state candidates.\nAccording to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, donations for secretary of state races in six battleground states are three times higher than they were at this point in the last election cycle, in 2018, and eight times higher than the 2014 cycle. Fundraising has particularly increased in Arizona, Geor\u00adgia and Michigan, which also happen to be the three states where Trump has issued an endorsement.\n\u201cA lot more money is going to these once sleepy, bureaucratic races,\u201d said Ian Vandewalker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center\u2019s elections and government program. \u201cThe places that we\u2019ve seen the biggest increase \u2013 which is basically Arizona, Georgia and Michigan \u2013 each of those places had some degree of nationally covered election controversy around 2020.\u201d\nThe Brennan Center analysis also indicated that out-of-state donations to secretary of state candidates are increasing at an even faster rate than overall donations. Finchem, who has called on the Arizona legislature to decertify the 2020 presidential results in three major counties, already has six times as many donors as every secretary of state candid\u00adate in the 2018 elec\u00adtion combined. Two-thirds of those donors live outside Arizona.\nDemocrats have taken note of Republican enthusiasm about secretary of state elections, and they are responding by ramping up their own fundraising.\nThe Democratic Association of Secretaries of State and its partner groups raised a record $4.5m in 2021, compared with $1.5m raised during the entire 2018 cycle. The organization has said it is on track to meet its fundraising goal of $15m for the 2022 cycle, in part because of the increase in first-time individual donors. Other progressive groups, including End Citizens United and iVote, have pledged to spend tens of millions more on secretary of state races this year.\n\u201cThe engagement is at every single level. We have seen a massive increase in our email list and grassroots support,\u201d Rogers said.\nRogers believes Democratic activists are increasingly turning their attention to secretary of state races partly because they have been frustrated by the lack of progress at the federal level. Congressional Democrats have repeatedly tried to pass national voting rights legislation, which would reverse some of the voting restrictions enacted by 19 states last year, but Senate Republicans have successfully used the filibuster to defeat those bills.\n\u201cI think there are a lot of activists who got involved in 2020 who fought incredibly hard for the federal voting rights legislation in 2021,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWhen 50 Republicans blocked it yet again, folks were looking for a way to stay engaged and to continue the fight, and they shifted their assets into the states.\u201d\nRepublicans complain that Democrats are trying to alter election regulations to their benefit at both the federal and state levels. Andrew Romeo, communications director for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said Democrats were \u201cramping up their interest in secretary of state races because they see control of these offices as a way to change the rules to compensate for their inability to win elections\u201d.\nRomeo\u2019s group is an umbrella organization that promotes Republican candidates for state legislatures, state supreme courts and secretary of state offices, among other roles. The RSLC and its policy partner group raised $33.3m in 2021, exceeding their previous odd-year record by more than $14m.\nBut to Democrats like Rogers, the outcome of secretary of state races in key battleground states represents nothing less than the fate of American democracy.\n\u201cThese folks want to rig the game, and they are out to do that,\u201d Rogers said.\nVandewalker fears that the increasingly dire messaging about secretary of state races will contribute to a political climate in which both parties distrust the outcome of elections.\n\u201cMoney and attention being paid to these races is not inherently a bad thing. The voters should be informed about these candidates,\u201d Vandewalker said. But he adds, \u201cthat kind of rhetoric is extremely dangerous to voter confidence because of course one side or the other is going to win and is going to count the votes. And democracy counts on people accepting the result, even if their side doesn\u2019t win.\u201d",

        "content": "Roman Abramovich has been disqualified by the Premier League from owning Chelsea after having sanctions imposed on him by the UK government following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe league\u2019s decision to bar Abramovich from being a director of Chelsea in effect forces him to push ahead with his sale of the club. It came two days after the government imposed sanctions on the oligarch and granted the Stamford Bridge club a licence that allows them to keep operating under heavy restrictions.\nThe Premier League said the decision to disqualify Abramovich \u201cdoes not impact on the club\u2019s ability to train and play its fixtures, as set out under the terms of a licence issued by the Government which expires on 31 May 2022\u201d.\nThe government made minor amendments to the licence on Saturday. Chelsea can now spend \u00a3900,000 on match-day costs \u2013 increased from \u00a3500,000 \u2013 and will have access to prize money earned. Restrictions on selling tickets and the club\u2019s travel budget, capped at \u00a320,000 for away games, have not yet been amended.\nChelsea, who host Newcastle on Sunday, remain in a state of limbo. The decision to disqualify an owner would normally trigger a sale of their shareholding, with the rules stating that Chelsea have 28 days to ensure that Abramovich sells up. However, this will not be enforced if the planned takeover goes ahead but takes longer to complete.\nThe government is confident the sale of Chelsea will move quickly. Abramovich gave the green light for it to go ahead on Friday night and the Raine Group, the investment bank overseeing the process, has given potential bidders until 18 March to submit proposals.\nThe government views the British property tycoon Nick Candy and a consortium fronted by Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss and Todd Boehly as serious contenders. It has emerged that the third person involved with Boehly and Wyss is Jonathan Goldstein, the CEO of Cain International. Goldstein, a British businessman, is the former chair of the Jewish Leadership Council.\nSources in Westminster have not ruled out the chances of a takeover bid from Saudi Media succeeding. The company is led by Mohamed Alkhereiji, who is also the CEO of its parent company, Engineer Group Holding. Meanwhile Sir Martin Broughton, who helped facilitate Fenway Sports Group\u2019s takeover of Liverpool in 2010, is reportedly considering whether to enter the bidding.\nBroughton, a Chelsea fan, has also held discussions about taking a role in bids led by Boehly, Wyss and Goldstein, and by the Crystal Palace director Josh Harris. The 74-year-old, the former chairman of British Airways, now chairs Sports Investment Partners, a private investment firm which has backed businesses in areas such as sports technology and event management.\nAbramovich was disqualified under rule F.1.6, which states a director must be removed if \u201che/she becomes prohibited by law from being a director (including without limitation as a result of being subject to a disqualification order as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (as amended or any equivalent provisions in any jurisdiction which has a substantially similar effect) (\u2018the CDDA\u2019), or being subject to the terms of an undertaking given to the Secretary of State under the CDDA unless a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order under the CDDA permitting an appointment as a director)\u201d.\nHyundai, meanwhile, has become the latest company to suspend its association with Chelsea. The Korean car-maker signed a five-year sleeve sponsorship deal in 2018, but said: \u201cIn the current circumstances, we have suspended our marketing and communication activities with the club until further notice.\u201d Main sponsors Three suspended its links with the club on Thursday.",

        "content": "Ukraine city near Polish border has not yet been touched by Russian bombs but people are readying for the worst\nA few days ago, the local authorities of Lviv, 50 miles from the border with Poland and a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Ukrainians, ordered dozens of statues to be wrapped in padding to protect them from Russian attacks. Despite being so far untouched by the bombings, the 700,000 inhabitants of this magnificent Unesco world heritage site knew that, at some point, the time would also come for them.\nSo when last Friday the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, about 130kmaway, were targeted by Russian forces in one of the military attacks located closest to the west since the beginning of the war, it came as no surprise.\nThe citizens of Lviv, among the strongest supporters of the country\u2019s separation from the Soviet Union, are well aware that their town \u2013 described as the soul of Ukraine and a symbol of Ukrainian nationalism \u2013 represents everything the Kremlin despises.\n\u201cEvery day, the Russians are coming closer and closer,\u201d said Vasyl Dovhan, 28, an attendant at the Nobilis Hotel in Lviv. \u201cWe are a bit scared, of course. But we are ready and united, and we will not surrender. We believe in Ukrainian forces and the international community is on our side. The world these days is finally watching the true face of the Russian regime, which will burn in hell for killing our innocent people.\u2019\u2019\nOne explanation for why Lviv has avoided strikes while neighbouring cities such as Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk have been bombed is that the Kremlin left the city\u2019s motorway and railway links open to funnel refugees into Poland, deliberately focusing a massive refugee crisis on Ukraine\u2019s neighbour.\nWhatever the reason, life on the streets of Lviv, the heart of the Greek Catholic church in Ukraine (in contrast with the Russian Orthodox Christians) has gone on as usual despite now-daily air raid sirens. Singers continue to perform in the city\u2019s streets and people get up and go to work just like any other day. Nevertheless, the war is still visible here in all of its tragic proportions: thousands of displaced people seeking shelter arrive every day at the railway station from eastern cities being razed to the ground by airstrikes. At least 200,000 internally displaced people currently call Lviv home, stretching the city\u2019s capacity to its limits.\n\u2018\u2019We\u2019re using all our facilities to shelter them,\u201d says the deputy mayor of Lviv, Andriy Moskalenko. \u2018\u2019Universities, churches, factories have opened their doors to the displaced. And we\u2019ll continue to do so, because we have an obligation towards them. We will not let them down. At the same time, our resources are not infinite.\u2019\u2019\nThe newest arrivals are coming from Kyiv and Kharkiv, where the bombings have been going on for days. Compared with the destroyed eastern villages, Lviv remains relatively safe.\n\u2018\u2019I was in Kyiv during the first days of the war, which I mostly spent in a shelter or a hallway, and I no longer respond to air raid sirens,\u2019\u2019 said Tetyana Teren, 35, a journalist and the executive director of PEN Ukraine, the local branch of the free speech and authors\u2019 rights NGO.\nMany people in Lviv believe the recent bombings in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, about two hours away, carry at least two messages. The first is that the Russian advance could rapidly expand westward soon. The second is that no area of Ukraine, Lviv included, is safe.\nSince the invasion began, Lviv has rapidly transformed into a garrison town. It is the centre of the country\u2019s nationalist movement and, with its civil airport and military airfield, residents fear it may soon be in Russia\u2019s sights.\n\u201cAfter five days of calm, we have started to hear air raid sirens again,\u2019\u2019 says Moskalenko. \u201cWe know that at any moment they could strike us, too. We have seen how the Russians are capable of bombing hospitals, of killing defenceless children and women. We have seen what they have done in Mariupol and we are prepared for different scenarios, including a potential attack on the heart of our city.\u201d\nDuring the advance of Russian troops on Kyiv, foreign embassies have been transferred to Lviv, transforming the city into yet another symbol \u2013 that of the diplomatic capital of Ukraine and of the western response.\nFounded in the mid-13th century, Lviv was a royal city of the kingdom of Poland and its second-richest city. Its churches, streets and buildings reflect its rich history and culture. The idea that this magnificent town could be razed to the ground by bombs is unbearable for its people, and many remain convinced that Putin would never bomb a city with such an immeasurable artistic and cultural heritage.\nThe rest consider Lviv at war already, and are making preparations for a Russian attack. At the city gates, teenagers fortify checkpoints with sandbags and volunteers queue to join the military. A metallurgical plant, specialising in copper cables, is producing anti-tank obstacles. University students are sewing camouflage nets for the army.\n\u201cLviv remains the safest place in Ukraine,\u2019\u2019 says Nazar Vdovyhenko, 19, a waiter in a cafe in the city centre. \u201cSince the Russians invaded our country, we have been making preparations for this event for the entire time. We have our territorial defence, we have checkpoints, and finally we have the people\u2019s resistance. And we will fight. We will fight the Russians back.\u2019\u2019",

Russia supplies about 40% of Europe\u2019s gas and over a quarter of its crude oil.\nGermany\u2019s economy minister says his country wants to virtually end the importation of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year. Germany currently gets about half of its coal and oil from Russia.\nThe German government last month halted the Nord Stream 2 project intended to bring additional natural gas from Russia to Germany. The Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, threatened to impose an embargo on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany this week, after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports entirely.\nThe European Commission has proposed plans to diversify Europe\u2019s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy.\nBritish and European gas prices both hit record highs earlier this month, as the war continued to wreak havoc on energy markets, threatening to worsen the cost-of-living crisis.",

His emphatic second-half penalty, thumped down the middle in front of the travelling fans, sealed Liverpool\u2019s eighth straight league win.\nLuis D\u00edaz once again showed why, should the worst happen, life can go on. To say he has hit the ground running is like describing Usain Bolt as a jogger. On his first league start away from Anfield he flicked, kicked, twisted and spun to the ground. Each time he got up and cracked on, including thankfully after nodding Liverpool into the lead before being flattened by Robert S\u00e1nchez.\n\u201cThe \u2018boy\u2019 has settled as quickly as the \u2018player\u2019,\u201d said Klopp, pleased with victory in a \u201cdifficult game against a difficult opponent\u201d.\nWith Liverpool competing for multiple trophies, Klopp is having to manage his side like a rotisserie, turning his squad carefully to ensure just the right level of \u201cdone\u201d. Into the lineup came the February player of the month, Jo\u00ebl Matip. The centre-back made one of his trademark forays forward before releasing D\u00edaz, who reached the ball before the advancing S\u00e1nchez.\nThe forward was on the scoresheet but also on the floor; the celebrations were initially muted, a red card mooted. VAR decided against it and while Klopp was sanguine about the decision in the game\u2019s context, he suggested a wider issue: \u201cEverybody asked me whether it was a red card and you know if you get these questions most people think it was a red card.\n\u201cIf everybody thinks it was a red card for what reason could it not be a red card on VAR looking at it? There\u2019s only one reason \u2013 \u2018clear and obvious\u2019. The phrase is a real problem from our point of view.\n\u201cIt is wrong or right. It must not be clear and obviously wrong or right, just wrong or right. That\u2019s enough. Nobody should feel [like] overturning \u2013 if the VAR is part of the team of the refs and not somebody from outside \u2013 might embarrass the ref on the pitch.\u201d\nAfter the opening goal Liverpool shifted from slumber to virtual autopilot. When Naby Ke\u00efta fired against Yves Bissouma\u2019s outstretched hand just past the hour, Salah was able to net his 20th goal of the season in the league.\nBrighton are demob unhappy. They are neither upwardly or downwardly mobile this season and this was their fifth consecutive defeat. With one victory in 11, home is offering little comfort.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to have perspective or zoom out when you are suffering,\u201d said their manager, Graham Potter. \u201cThe boys gave everything; it\u2019s just the opponent was better.\u201d\nBefore falling behind they buzzed around in the yellow and blue strip they wore to show solidarity with Ukraine. They showed plenty of bravery, resulting in the rare sight of Fabinho looking slightly exposed by the neat triangles around him.\nThey perked up again in the second half with Leandro Trossard blazing over soon after the break. Then came the sad sight of Adam Lallana limping off against his former club five minutes after being introduced. But despite some late home pressure, Alisson\u2019s clean sheet looked in danger only when he tipped acrobatically over from Danny Welbeck.\nFor Potter, a past problem that had seemingly been resolved has reared its head again: possession offers little if not accompanied by goals. With one in five games those have dried up.\nNext for Liverpool comes their game in hand: a trip to Arsenal, who have replaced their soft underbelly with snarl and bite. But greatness will not be thrust upon Klopp\u2019s men; they must achieve it.",

        "content": "Captain Dan Biggar urged his side to end their Six Nations campaign on a high after their 13-9 loss to France\nA compelling Friday-night grapple with France resulted in a second successive narrow Six Nations defeat for Wales, leaving Wayne Pivac and his captain, Dan Biggar, to wonder what might have been.\nWales were on the wrong end of a 23-19 scoreline against England in the previous round, in a far more open encounter, but relentless French defence kept Wales scoreless in the second half at the Principality Stadium. They were restricted to three penalties from the boot of Biggar as France ground out a 13-9 win.\nFrom a Welsh perspective, much post-match analysis focused on a missed chance in the final quarter of an attritional contest. The peerless Wales No 8, Taulupe Faletau, collected a perfectly weighted kick to the wing by Biggar and delivered an instant pass inside to the centre Jonathan Davies.\nAgonisingly for Wales, he could not gather the ball with the try-line beckoning. There was no guarantee Davies would have scored a try with Antoine Dupont, the powerful France scrum-half, in position to make a tackle.\n\u201cIt was a very tight Test match, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Pivac said. \u201cIt came down to one score in the end. They had one opportunity and got it, and we couldn\u2019t quite finish off. Apart from winning the game, we did pretty much what we wanted to do out there to get the result.\u201d\nRepeatedly asked if he felt frustrated, Biggar said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to answer the questions in a different way. It\u2019s very, very difficult when there\u2019s games you should have won and you\u2019ve come off second best.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really pleasing, the way we\u2019ve played. We put a really good shift in and pushed the best team in the world, probably at the moment, and we\u2019ve pushed them to the edge and probably should have picked a win up. But ultimately they\u2019ve got the win and we\u2019re the ones who are disappointed.\u201d\nWelsh hopes of defending their Six Nations title had evaporated before Friday night but next Saturday\u2019s final-round meeting with Italy at the Principality Stadium will carry some significance: Biggar is poised to win his 100th Wales cap while Alun Wyn Jones, who will join the playing squad after successful rehabilitation from shoulder surgery, could claim his 150th.\nBiggar said: \u201cIt\u2019s really important we come back in next week and don\u2019t just use it as a \u2018cruise week\u2019 or a week to just get through to the end of the tournament. We\u2019ve got to go and do a job on Italy, not in any disrespectful way at all. We\u2019ve got to concentrate on ourselves and put on a really good performance.\n\u201cApart from the game against Ireland we\u2019ve been right in the mix in games and played some really good stuff so to finish off with a positive result will be huge.\u201d\nAfter a third straight win against Wales \u2013 following a sequence of seven defeats in eight \u2013 France head back to Stade de France in Paris with a chance to seal a grand slam against England. Les Bleus were depleted by Covid-19 in Cardiff, with Damian Penaud and Romain Taofif\u00e9nua left at home after testing positive. But the picture painted by the head coach, Fabien Galthi\u00e9, was of a more serious hit to their playing resources before the match.\n\u201cWe had a team that was ill, half of them with flu and half of them with Covid,\u201d Galthi\u00e9 said of a squad that are gathering momentum before hosting next year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cBut despite the virus the team has managed to get a victory and that\u2019s the most important thing.\n\u201cWales were very tactical and tried to push us back with a lot of very long kicks. We managed to react well to their game. We knew it would be difficult because they have won the competition several times and it\u2019s not by chance.\u201d\nTold that Biggar had named them probably the world\u2019s best team, Dupont, the France captain, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very flattering to be praised by other teams. But to know who\u2019s the best? We\u2019ll see that later.\u201d\nStarting against England in Paris next Saturday night.",

        "content": "The invasion of Ukraine could pitch Moscow, and the world, back into financial crises that had seemed part of history\nThe big western brands showed Vladimir Putin how to do it. While the Kremlin\u2019s army was getting bogged down in Ukraine, Coca-Cola and Starbucks lost no time in closing their doors to Russian customers.\nBut the most emblematic move of all came from McDonald\u2019s, which has shut all 850 of its outlets in Russia. The availability of Big Macs in the Soviet Union was seen in 1990 as evidence that the west\u2019s old cold war foe was turning its back on communism, but the past fortnight has rekindled memories of the bad old days. There were queues outside McDonald\u2019s when it first opened in Moscow. Last week, Russians queued for one last burger before the pull-out began.\nOne of Putin\u2019s predecessors in the Kremlin \u2013 Lenin \u2013 once said there were decades when nothing happens and weeks when decades happen, and that\u2019s true of the period since Russian troops moved across the border into Ukraine on 24 February.\nIt is not just that Russia faces a brutal recession. It is the shattering of the idea of a seamless post-cold-war global economy. It is the return to days of higher defence spending in the west. It is the possibility that governments may backpedal on their net zero carbon pledges.\n\u201cPutin has created his own worst nightmare,\u201d says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economist at Allianz and president of Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge. \u201cHe has united the west in a way it hasn\u2019t been for a long time; he has been the catalyst for arms to Ukraine on a large scale; he has changed Germany\u2019s approach to military spending; and he has brought the Russian economy to its knees. It is incredible.\u201d\nFreezing the bulk of Russia\u2019s reserves has meant the central bank has struggled to shore up the rouble, which has plummeted by a third on the currency markets. Capital controls have been introduced, interest rates have more than doubled, and annual inflation is heading for 20%. The stock market has been closed and financial markets fear Moscow may default on a sovereign debt repayment later this week.\nJohn Lough, an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, who in his previous role at Nato during the mid-1990s was the alliance\u2019s first representative to be based in Moscow, says: \u201cThe middle classes are going to be very badly affected by the lack of access to foreign holidays, gadgets, and nice food \u2013 things they\u2019re used to but are now going to dry up. Symbolism in politics and international relations is important. What does this signal? It signals \u2018back to the USSR.\u2019\u201d\nAnalysts warn of the sharpest annual decline for Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, as the exodus of western capital, technology and knowhow draws a 21st-century iron curtain around the Russian economy.\nBank of America forecasts a plunge in gross domestic product of 13% this year \u2013 a bigger hit than the pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis caused.\nThe west\u2019s sanctions have turned Putin\u2019s Russia into a North Korea-style pariah state, but the tough measures will have consequences for a fragile global economy still recovering from Covid-19.\nIt may only be the world\u2019s 11th biggest economy, with a shrinking population and fewer links to global supply chains than China, but Russia\u2019s status as the world\u2019s biggest exporter of natural gas and the second-biggest exporter of crude oil means it punches above its weight.\nRussia accounts for just over a quarter of EU oil imports and 40% of gas, a figure rising to 65% in Germany and 100% in some eastern European states. For the US, the exposure is not so great.: it is the world\u2019s biggest producer of oil, with a vast internal market, and just 7% of its oil imports come from Russia.\nFor Germany, gas deliveries started in the late 1960s, as a product of the Ostpolitik agenda of former leader Willy Brandt, who wanted closer trade links between West Germany and the east as a way of overcoming tensions with the Soviet Union.\nThroughout her 16 years in power, Angela Merkel remained committed to imports, including the development of the now-halted Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany\u2019s energy dependence only grew when the country scaled down nuclear production when Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union came under pressure amid a rise in support for the Greens in 2011.\n\u201cThis whole legacy of Ostpolitik has been turned on its head,\u201d says Lough. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is going to be a transformation. The EU\u2019s commitment to dramatically reduce energy dependence on Russia goes to the heart of it.\u201d\nIt is unlikely, though, to be a smooth process. With the world seeking alternative energy sources, commodity strategists at Bank of America estimate that less than half of Russian exports can be replaced by Iran, the Opec nations and US shale.\nGlobal crises in energy markets have form for upsetting the international economy, as well as triggering lasting change. The long postwar boom was brought to a head when action by the Opec cartel led to a quadrupling of crude oil prices in late 1973. There were echoes of that last week, when Brent crude rose above $130 a barrel, within sight of its record high of $147 a barrel, reached in 2008.\nEl-Erian says there was a chance of stagflation \u2013 a combination of rapidly rising prices and weak growth \u2013 in the global economy even before the Russian invasion. \u201cNow stagflation has become the baseline and a global recession has become the risk scenario,\u201d he adds.\nRussia is no stranger to economic crises. The \u201cshock treatment\u201d administered by the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral bodies after the demise of the Soviet Union was brutal. Output fell consistently until the middle of the 1990s, unemployment peaked at almost 14%, and rising alcoholism and suicides led to a sharp fall in male life expectancy. A debt default in 1998 sent ripples through global financial markets, leading to the collapse of the US hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.\nThe economy has been through three phases since the collapse of communism, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. An initial period of rapid but often disorderly change gave way to progress from the late 1990s onwards. Following other post-socialist countries, Russia started to build closer links with the wider European and global economy, helped by a surge in oil prices. In a third phase, global isolation has set in since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, pushing Moscow to focus on self-dependence and a \u201cfortress Russia\u201d economic policy to guard against western sanctions.\nThe only problem, economists say, is that the road to autarky is rarely a recipe for sustained success.\n\u201cStep by step, it is starting to resemble some features of the late Soviet Union of the Brezhnev era \u2013 an underperforming petro-economy with an oversized military sector,\u201d says Schmieding.\nAway from oil, Russia is vital for rare earth minerals and agricultural products such as wheat, corn and sunflower oil. Together Russia and Ukraine account for a quarter of the world\u2019s wheat exports; prices have surged by more than 50% as the breadbasket of the world grapples with war.\nSome developing countries will find they are paying the price. Russia supplies Egypt, with a population in excess of 100 million, with 85% of its wheat imports, while as much as 90% of Lebanon\u2019s wheat and cooking oil imports come from Ukraine and Russia.\nFor the UK, surging oil prices are already hitting motorists hard, driving pump prices of both unleaded petrol and diesel to record highs last week.\nAlthough the UK gets as little as 5% of its gas and 10% of its oil from Russia \u2013 meaning a phasing-out of supplies is unlikely to lead to shortages \u2013 soaring gas prices on wholesale markets will add to the cost-of-living squeeze. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is coming under pressure to boost support for households in his spring statement on 23 March.\nHigh inflation is expected to result in the biggest annual fall in living standards since at least the 1970s \u2013 costing the average household at least \u00a31,000 a year \u2013 as pay fails to keep pace with prices.\nGerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at the wealth management company Netwealth, says: \u201cI don\u2019t think a recession for the UK can be ruled out, even though it is not the most likely scenario.\u201d\nSqueezing Putin\u2019s financial power could encourage Russia to build closer ties with China. With the payments system, and central banks\u2019 power to intervene in currency markets, snarled by sanctions, turning to the Chinese yuan and payment networks overseen by Beijing could prove attractive.\nHowever, experts believe there may be reluctance in both countries for a Sino-Russian pact. Pipelines and other infrastructure for large-scale exports of oil and gas eastwards are not in place, while there could be repercussions for Beijing if it helps Russia evade extensive and coordinated western sanctions.\n\u201cThey will be pushed closer to China, but that\u2019s very uncomfortable for Russia without the balancing relationship with the west and access to western finance and technologies. That underlines the weakness of the Russian system,\u201d says Lough.\n\u201cMy view is this will fatally undermine his position. He\u2019s brought a form of destruction upon Russia because the economic impact is going to be so great. There is just no justification for it. It\u2019s an extraordinary miscalculation.\u201d\nAnd one with repercussions far beyond Russia.",

The re-emergence of Ivan Toney \u2013 with the help of Christian Eriksen \u2013 to sink Burnley with a late double could be enough to retain Brentford\u2019s Premier League status.\nThomas Frank, the Bees\u2019 head coach, welcoming a nine-point cushion above 18th-placed Burnley, acknowledged the home supporters warmly. It was not a lap of honour exactly, but if the Bees stay in the top flight, that in itself will represent success in this buoyant corner of west London.\nBurnley departed the capital empty-handed despite a confident, organised display. However, Toney stretched the Clarets to deliver in the dying moments, with the luxury of Eriksen\u2019s assistance.\nThoughts of still-anxious Bees fans that last weekend\u2019s enterprising success at Norwich, following a torrid run of form, was a one-off can be shelved. Brentford have never been quite as bad as some setbacks suggested \u2013 but this is an interlude to finally enjoy. Toney headed home from an inviting Eriksen cross with four minutes to go, before converting a late penalty after he was sent tumbling by Nathan Collins. The Burnley defender was subsequently sent off by referee Paul Tierney.\nHaving looked effervescent in a 3-0 win at Brighton a few weeks ago, the Lancashire outfit could not repeat the same feat, with Jay Rodriguez, on as a substitute, crashing a fine shot against the bar in the second half. These points may have the same emotional resonance for Brentford as, for instance, their triumph over Arsenal on the opening night of the season, which led to an initial surge. Creating a decent gap above beleaguered Leeds and Everton pleased Frank, ever the genuine optimist.\n\u201cIt was a very tight, competitive game,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we had more dangerous situations than Burnley. The team is happy.\n\u201cIt was a good performance but we can be better on the ball. Every win in the Premier League is so difficult and we\u2019ve managed to do it in two very important games.\n\u201cI think Ivan started the season well, then Covid hurt him and now he\u2019s getting back up to speed. He\u2019s showing that level he showed at the beginning of the season and there is more to come from him.\n\u201cToday we had the quality from Eriksen with a wonderful cross for the first goal. He is already at a good level and just needs another 10% with more sharpness. For me it was not a gamble, maybe the best signing ever for Brentford. I knew what he could do for us.\u201d\nWhile clearly a setback, Sean Dyche will at least be consoled with plenty still to play for. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big blow, we\u2019ve still 11 games left,\u201d the Clarets\u2019 manager said.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot wrong with the performance. Ten games ago we were written off and we\u2019re still in there, fighting.\n\u201cI thought it was a soft penalty and soft red. But we have a wise group here.\u201d\nUnfortunately for Burnley, their next league fixture is at home to Manchester City on 2 April. All considered, it was a day of breaks, which ultimately favoured Brentford.",

Democrats in Congress last year introduced a bill to add four justices and Joe Biden has created a commission to study expansion.\nFew analysts think expansion is likely to happen.\nRepublican senators are currently attacking Biden for his campaign promise to nominate a first Black woman to the court, a promise he fulfilled by nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to replace the retiring Stephen Breyer.\nRepublican presidents have nominated justices on grounds of identity, most recently when Trump said he would pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the liberal lion who died in September 2020.\nIgnoring their own claims about the impropriety of confirmations in election years, made in denying Merrick Garland even a hearing to replace Antonin Scalia in 2016, Senate Republicans installed Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative, as Ginsberg\u2019s replacement.\nIn Utah on Friday, Thomas also voiced a familiar conservative complaint about so-called \u201ccancel culture\u201d, the supposed silencing of voices or world views deemed unacceptable on political grounds.\nHe was, he said, \u201cafraid, particularly in this world of cancel culture attack, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to learn to engage as we did when I grew up.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t learn at that level in high school, in grammar school, in your neighborhood, or in civic organizations, then how do you have it when you\u2019re making decisions in government, in the legislature, or in the courts?\u201d\nThomas also attacked the media for, he said, cultivating inaccurate impressions about public figures including himself, his wife and Scalia.\nGinni Thomas has faced scrutiny for her involvement in groups that file briefs about cases in front of the supreme court, as well as using Facebook to amplify partisan attacks.\nThomas has claimed the supreme court is above politics \u2013 a claim made by justices on either side of the partisan divide.\nCongress is preparing for confirmation hearings for Jackson. She will be installed if all 50 Democratic senators back her, via the casting vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Some Republicans have indicated they could support her too.\nIn Utah, Thomas recalled his own confirmation in 1991 as a humiliating and embarrassing experience. Lawmakers including Biden grilled Thomas about sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill, a former employee, leading him to call the experience a \u201chigh tech lynching\u201d. Biden has also been criticised for his treatment of Hill.\nOn Friday, Thomas said he held civility as one of his highest values. He said he learned to respect institutions and debate civilly with those who disagreed with him during his years in school.\nBased on conversations with students in recent years, he said, he does not believe colleges are now welcoming places for productive debate, particularly for students who support what he described as traditional families or oppose abortion.\nThomas did not reference the future of Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights. The court on which he sits is scheduled to rule this year on Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, concerning whether Mississippi can ban abortions at 15 weeks.\nThe court is expected to overturn Roe. While the justices deliberate, conservative lawmakers in Florida, West Virginia and Kentucky are advancing similar legislation.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy reveals that at least 1,300 Ukrainian troops have died as French and German talks with Vladimir Putin fail\nRussia has said it will treat arms shipments to Ukraine from Nato countries as \u201clegitimate targets\u201d for military action in a dangerous new escalation of tensions.\nThe warning from the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, came as supporters of Ukraine, including the UK, Germany and the United States, have been urgently shipping thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Kyiv in response to Moscow\u2019s aggression.\nRyabkov said that Russia had \u201cwarned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn\u2019t just a dangerous move, it\u2019s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets\u201d.\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, disclosed that at least 1,300 of his country\u2019s troops have been killed in the conflict so far in the first estimate of Ukraine\u2019s combat losses after almost three weeks of fighting. Ukraine has claimed to have killed some 12,000 Russian troops.\nHeavy fighting continued across Ukraine. The French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz reported that Vladimir Putin showed no willingness to end the war after a phone call between the leaders in which they renewed a call for a ceasefire and negotiations. A statement from the office of the French president described the conversation with the Russian leader as \u201cvery frank and also difficult\u201d.\nRussian forces continued to pulverise the besieged port city of Mariupol, shelling a mosque sheltering more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said on Saturday, while fighting also raged on the outskirts of Kyiv.\nIn several areas around the capital artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter and air raid sirens wailed. Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence said that Russian ground forces massed north of Kyiv had now edged to within 15 miles of the city centre as their attempt to encircle it ground on.\nColumns of smoke were seen rising over the southwest of the city after a strike on an ammunition depot in the town of Vasylkiv.\nIn the south, Ukraine\u2019s military said that Russian forces captured Mariupol\u2019s eastern outskirts, tightening the armed squeeze on the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.\nZelenskiy encouraged his people to keep up their resistance, which many analysts said has prevented the rapid offensive and military victory the Kremlin had expected. \u201cThe fact that the whole Ukrainian people resist these invaders has already gone down in history, but we do not have the right to let up our defence, no matter how difficult it may be for us,\u201d he said.\nHe accused Russia of employing \u201ca new stage of terror\u201d with the apparent kidnapping of the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who was last seen being led away from his office on Friday by armed men, prompting a demonstration in the city.\nZelenskiy added that Russia would need to carpet-bomb the Ukrainian capital and kill its residents to take the city. \u201cThey will come here only if they kill us all,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that is their goal, let them come.\u201d\nIn a bleak coda that spoke of the continuing levels of destruction, Zelenskiy added that some small Ukrainian towns had ceased to exist.\nDespite crippling economic sanctions imposed on Moscow and international isolation, Putin \u2013 who has imposed his own draconian crackdown on media freedom and free speech in Russia \u2013 has given no indication of being swayed to end the war.\nIn his 90-minute call with Macron and Scholz on Saturday, Putin spoke about \u201cissues related to agreements under discussion to implement the Russian demands\u201d for ending the war, the Kremlin said without providing details. Among other things, the Kremlin has previously demanded a promise by Nato never to accept Ukraine as a member and for the alliance to pull back from countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.\nUkrainian officials continued efforts to evacuate besieged cities, including the capital, as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas.\nThe governor of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing yesterday morning but later said some evacuations were proceeding. \u201cWe will try to get people out every day, as long as it\u2019s possible to observe a ceasefire,\u201d he said.\nThe governor of the Russian-controlled territory of Donetsk said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into Mariupol.\n\u201cThere are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,\u201d the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. \u201cMedicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.\u201d\nPeople were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying dead bodies near where they lay, a staff member for the international group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in the city said.\n\u201cWe saw people who died because of lack of medication,\u201d he said, adding that many people had also been wounded or killed. \u201cNeighbours just dig a hole in the ground and put the dead bodies inside.\u201d",

        "content": "The 10-year anniversary of the plan has sparked criticism of the successive governments\u2019 failure to implement the report\u2019s recommendations\n\nWhen the Gonski review was released a decade ago, it was hailed as the answer to Australia\u2019s educational woes \u2013 a roadmap to creating an equitable school funding system, and boosting the performance of Australian students on the global stage.\nBut rather than celebrating its success, its 10-year anniversary last month sparked critique of the failure of successive governments to implement the report\u2019s recommendations.\nDespite record levels of funding flowing to Australia\u2019s schools, education results have suffered a 20-year decline on international benchmarks. Meanwhile, a new analysis paints a bleak picture of a widening gap between advantaged and disadvantaged schools, with commonwealth and state funding for private schools increasing at nearly five times the rate of public school funding over the decade to 2019-20.\nEducation experts now warn that the vision enshrined in the review will only be realised if the commonwealth and states unite to end the \u201cdefrauding\u201d of public schools and fully fund them to their needs-based benchmark.\nAhead of next year\u2019s expiry of the current state-federal funding deal, the National School Reform Agreement, experts say there must be a coordinated effort to ensure Gonski\u2019s vision is realised.\n \nIn 2010, businessman David Gonski was engaged by the Rudd government to lead a review into Australia\u2019s school funding, with the aim of reducing the impact of social disadvantage on educational outcomes, and ending inequities in the distribution of public money. The report was released in February 2012, during Julia Gillard\u2019s prime ministership.\nThe reforms recommended that governments reduce payments to overfunded schools that didn\u2019t need them and redirect funds on a needs-based model. Its key recommendation was the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) \u2013 a base rate of funding per student with additional loading for disadvantage factors such as Indigenous heritage. The SRS would determine the required funding needed for each school. But a decade on, most public schools are yet to reach their full funding according to their SRS and more funding has gone to the less needy schools, with non-government schools well above their benchmark.\nGonski said the system would \u201censure that differences in educational outcomes are not the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions\u201d when he delivered his findings to government in 2011.\nTrevor Cobbold, an economist and national convenor for public school advocacy group Save Our Schools, says the failure to achieve the review\u2019s goals was a result of failures by the Gillard government and those that followed to implement the report\u2019s recommendations.\n\u201cGonski didn\u2019t fail. It is governments that failed Gonski, and thereby failed disadvantaged students,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou have to construct a system that recognises both the commonwealth and state roles, and Gonski did this by designing a nationally integrated model on a needs-basis.\u201d\nCobbold argues the Gonski reforms were only \u201cpartially implemented\u201d by the Gillard government because the former prime minister was constrained by her own commitment that no school would lose a dollar of funding. He also points to Gillard\u2019s deal with Catholic Church that its schools would maintain their existing share of education funding \u2013 an arrangement that was extended to independent schools.\nWhen the Turnbull government passed needs-based education funding legislation in 2017, it wasn\u2019t projected to be achieved for at least a decade.\nThe legislation was based on the review\u2019s key recommendation of a SRS. Under the reform, overfunded independent schools would have their funding brought down to the SRS benchmark by 2029 while underfunded public schools would have their funding increased over the same period.\nBut the funding projections show public schools in all states except the ACT would be funded at only 91% or less of their SRS until at least 2029.\nMore recently, \u201cfunding deals\u201d the Morrison government established for private schools outside of the needs-based model \u2013 designed to soften the financial impact for non-government schools during the transition to a new funding model \u2013 further undermined the plan.\nTom Greenwell, a Canberra-based teacher and co-author of Waiting for Gonski \u2013 How Australia Failed its Schools, says a \u201chuge problem\u201d is that the \u201creal work of additional funding has always been delayed beyond the forward estimates, to the next funding agreement\u201d.\n\u201cNeeds-based funding needs to be delivered now,\u201d he says.\nDr Glenn Savage, an education reform researcher at the University of Western Australia, agrees that the Gonski reform never delivered the needs-based funding model that it initially set out to deliver.\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the system have never been addressed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe large amount of money that goes to the independent and Catholic schools has never really been under threat as a result of Gonski.\u201d\nUnder the current school funding agreement struck in 2019, the commonwealth contributes 80% of the SRS for private schools, while state governments are responsible for the remaining 20%.\nThe split is reversed for public schools, but the states\u2019 minimum \u201cformal target\u201d for public schools is only 75% despite the Turnbull government originally proposing 80%.\nThe agreement also allows state governments to include SRS contributions on items not originally deemed part of the Gonski benchmark, such as depreciation and transport. Cobbold says these \u201cloopholes\u201d contribute to under-funding and further drag down the contributions to government schools.\nThe states have argued the funding deal forced them to increase their education budgets by hundreds of millions of dollars, and have accused the commonwealth of failing to enact a more collaborative approach to funding rather than a one-size-fits-all scheme.\nWhile neither of the major parties have yet sought to make education funding a core policy area for the upcoming election, whoever wins will be tasked with negotiating a new school reform funding agreement with the states and territories.\nCobbold says the current bilateral funding deal, which is due to expire in December 2023, must end the \u201cdefrauding\u201d of the public school system, and require states to step up their contributions.\nSavage agrees that \u201cit\u2019s the states that are letting public schools down\u201d. \n \u201cWe have the state saying to parents: \u2018If your child goes to a private school in this state, they deserve to be fully funded under the Gonski model. If they go to public school, they don\u2019t deserve to be fully funded.\u2019 And what kind of message is that sending about how governments value private schools relative to public schools in our nation?\u201d\nPete Goss, who leads PwC Australia\u2019s school education consulting practice, says the next step must be determining how to get federal and state governments to lift funding for government schools \u201cback up to our national promise\u201d of the SRS.\n\u201cLifting government schools up to the full Gonski funding would be worth more than a $1,000 per student per year,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAt all levels of government at this point, we\u2019d need a joint commitment to lift per student funding of government schools, so that it was in line with our national promise.\u201d\nThe parameters of the 80-20 state-commonwealth funding split could be renegotiated in the next funding deal.\nVictoria, for example, agreed in 2019 to lift its contribution towards the SRS from 67% \u2013 the nation\u2019s lowest per-student funding level \u2013 to 75% over 10 years. The state\u2019s education minister, James Merlino, says the commonwealth should fund the final 5% of the SRS for government schools.\nBut, as Goss says, \u201ca school doesn\u2019t care where a dollar comes from\u201d.",

        "content": "Entertainment giant suspends political donations as CEO apologises for silence and governor hits back with \u2018communist\u2019 barb\nThe Republican governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, claimed the Walt Disney Company was too cozy with communist China, as the chief executive of the tourism and entertainment criticized a state bill that bars teachers from instructing early grades on LGBTQ+ issues.\nDeSantis, who has not yet signed the so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, also reportedly criticized Disney as \u201cwoke\u201d, after the company\u2019s leader opposed the legislation.\nControversy surrounding the bill could cut off a significant fundraising pipeline for Florida Republicans: Disney said it would suspend political donations in the state.\nThe move came after the Disney chief executive, Bob Chapek, experienced extensive blowback for not using the company\u2019s influence to thwart the controversial bill.\n\u201cI do not want anyone to mistake a lack of a statement for a lack of support,\u201d Chapek said early this week in a memo obtained by USA Today.\n\u201cWe all share the same goal of a more tolerant, respectful world. Where we may differ is in the tactics to get there.\n\u201cAnd because this struggle is much bigger than any one bill in any one state, I believe the best way for our company to bring about lasting change is through the inspiring content we produce, the welcoming culture we create, and the diverse community organizations we support.\u201d\nChapek\u2019s first public statements on the bill came in a shareholder\u2019s meeting on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe were opposed to the bill from the outset but we chose not to take a public position on it because we thought we could be more effective working behind the scenes engaging directly with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he reportedly said.\nChapek claimed such efforts had taken place for weeks. The executive said he had called DeSantis to express Disney\u2019s \u201cdisappointment\u201d with the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill.\nChapek posted a statement online and emailed staffers on Friday, saying Disney was wrong to stay silent as the Republican-majority Florida legislature greenlit a bill he called \u201cyet another challenge to basic human rights\u201d.\nRepublicans contend that parents, not educators, should discuss gender issues with children in early grades. The bill bars prohibits instruction on \u201csexual orientation or gender identity\u201d in kindergarten through grade three.\nDeSantis, who has indicated that he supports the measure, has chafed at calls for a veto. A potential frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, he sent a fundraising email that said: \u201cDisney is in far too deep with the communist party of China and has lost any moral authority to tell you what to do.\u201d\nThe statement shocked Republicans and Democrats. Disney theme parks are a multibillion-dollar economic engine for Florida. The company has given outsize amounts to state parties and politicians and holds significant influence in state government.\nDeSantis also criticized Disney at a campaign event in South Florida Thursday.\n\u201cCompanies that have made a fortune catering to families should understand that parents don\u2019t want this injected into their kid\u2019s kindergarten classroom,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cOur policies will be based on the best interest of Florida citizens, not the musing of woke corporations.\u201d\nRick Wilson, a former Republican operative now part of the Lincoln Project, told the Associated Press: \u201cThe weird hypocrisy of Florida politics right now is DeSantis has been happy to take Disney\u2019s money but to pass a bill that\u2019s anathema to the values of their customers and their institution.\u201d\nA Republican lawmaker who didn\u2019t want to be named because he or she did not want to comment publicly against the governor told the same outlet Disney was the third-highest contributor to state Republican candidates. Disney has given millions to both Democrats and Republicans.\nDisney opened a theme park in China six years ago and has landed access to that country\u2019s booming film market. It has also been accused of altering content to satisfy China\u2019s leaders.\nDeSantis\u2019s critics charged that he was opposing Disney out of his ambition to win the Republican primary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty shocking,\u201d former Republican governor Charlie Crist, now a Democratic congressman who hopes to challenge DeSantis, told the AP.\nCrist noted that DeSantis has gone head-to-head with other industries important to Florida, pointing to a legal fight with cruise companies which wanted passengers to show proof of Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s Disney. Who\u2019s next on the hit list for this governor?\u201d Crist commented.\nThe Democratic US congressman Darren Soto also questioned the governor\u2019s attack.\n\u201cThis is another strike in the hate agenda that Governor DeSantis is pushing right now,\u201d Soto said, noting that Florida\u2019s budget relies heavily on sales tax generated by Disney and other theme parks.\n\u201cNow he\u2019s putting that in jeopardy because he wants to attack LGBTQ+ families, families that make up a fundamental part of the Disney atmosphere.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "content": "Since the Ukraine crisis began, the prime minister\u2019s net approval ratings have improved \u2013 but from very low levels\nA majority of voters still want to see Boris Johnson resign despite the crisis over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.\nThere has been a significant fall in the proportion of voters who want the prime minister to stand aside. However, the new poll showed that 53% still wanted to see him go \u2013 down 10 points since January.\nOn the Ukraine crisis, a majority (52%) think the government has not gone far enough on accepting Ukrainian refugees into the UK. When asked whether they would take in Ukrainian refugees themselves, 9% of people said that they would, while a further 20% said they would consider it. About 63% said they were not in a position to do so, while 8% said they were, but wouldn\u2019t.\nFourth-fifths (78%) of the UK support sending arms to Ukraine. Similarly, almost seven in 10 (68%) support donating western fighter planes for the Ukrainian air force to use in the country\u2019s defence.\nVoters are divided over a potential no-fly zone over Ukraine, with 40% saying they support western air forces enforcing a no-fly zone, and the shooting down of Russian aircraft that breach this, but 39% disagreeing.\nThere are clear concerns over the cost of living at home. There was a 15-point increase in those who now expect the economy to get worse over the next year (71%), while 57% expect their personal finances to worsen \u2013 up 12 points.\nJohnson\u2019s net approval ratings have improved from low levels. Those approving of the job he is doing make up 27%, with 54% disapproving. That gives him a net approval rating of -27, a 6-point improvement on the last poll a fortnight ago. Keir Starmer\u2019s ratings remain largely unchanged, giving him a net approval rating of -2.\nOverall, Labour\u2019s lead has fallen marginally to 2 points over the Tories. Starmer\u2019s party has 37% support, with the Tories on 35%. When people were asked who they preferred as prime minister, \u201cnone of these\u201d remained the clear leader. However, when forced to choose, people would still prefer a Labour government led by Starmer (44%) over a Conservative government led by Johnson (35%).\nJoe Curran, senior research executive at Opinium, said: \u201cWhile most European countries are granting fleeing Ukrainians visa-free refuge, the UK has so far opted to require visas, to much outrage from certain quarters. Our polling finds that over half (52%) of the British public think that the government hasn\u2019t gone far enough in accepting refugees.\n\u201cAs for Boris Johnson, a cynic would say that the crisis in Ukraine offers both a distraction from domestic controversies and also the opportunity to act the statesman. Indeed we have seen a small uptick in his approval ratings, although we can\u2019t say for certain that this is related to the war in the east. Whether this trend continues depends on many factors including the deepening cost of living crisis.\u201d\nOpinium polled 2,007 people online between 9 and 11 March.",

        "content": "Brazilian is unsuitable for celebrity clubs and philosophy sides, but Steven Gerrard could build a team around him\nPhilippe Coutinho has played 598 minutes for Aston Villa, in which time he has scored four goals and set up three more. Victory at Leeds on Thursday meant Villa have won three league games in a row for the first time since the beginning of last season. There is a real sense of momentum there now and it is not just about results. Coutinho, quite aside from his direct contribution, is a player of stature, the sort of figure whose very presence can persuade fans, even other players, that a club is going places. Which inevitably prompts the question: what is he doing at Villa?\nIt\u2019s probably largely an economic question. As the rest of European football retrenches because of the economic impact of the pandemic, the Premier League\u2019s relentless expansion goes on. The English middle class can afford players who are out of range to all but a tiny handful abroad.\nBut it\u2019s also a question rooted in modern ideas of what an attack-minded player should be. To create is no longer enough and Coutinho is not a natural presser. His gift is inconsistent; already at Villa he has had one stinker, in the win over Everton. Football is haunted by these castaways left behind by the economics of the modern game: too expensive for all but the absolute elite to own, but too unreliable for the absolute elite to play.\nIn his second autobiography, published in 2015 after his move to MLS, Steven Gerrard told Liverpool to \u201ctreasure Philippe\u201d, saying he could become \u201cLiverpool\u2019s main man and a top player in world football\u201d. But in the last game Gerrard had played with Coutinho, Liverpool lost 6-1 at Stoke. Coutinho\u2019s is a career dotted with major disappointments: Liverpool\u2019s 3-1 defeat to Sevilla, Barcelona\u2019s 4-0 defeat at Anfield, Brazil\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Belgium \u2026\nTwo months after Gerrard\u2019s autobiography was released, J\u00fcrgen Klopp replaced Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager. There was a thought Coutinho wasn\u2019t a natural Klopp player but he seemed to adapt well enough. A year after Klopp\u2019s arrival, though, Barcelona made him a target, with the Catalan newspaper Sport announcing \u201cObjetivo Coutinho\u201d. Immediately he became not just a footballer but also a pawn in a wider game of super-club power relations and also therefore less than a footballer, somebody else\u2019s prize. For Coutinho, nothing has been quite the same since.\nHe signed a new contract in January 2017, another example of Liverpool\u2019s smart recent transfer dealings; if they were going to lose him, they were going to ensure they secured an enormous fee. That arrived the following January, thanks to Barcelona\u2019s desperation to spend the money they had received for Neymar. Humiliated by losing one Brazilian star, they needed another; Coutinho\u2019s form had wavered as he suffered a back injury but Liverpool were able to negotiate the fee up to \u20ac120m with a potential further \u20ac40m in add-ons. That largely funded the signings of Virgil van Dijk and Allison; Liverpool, in the end, were the biggest beneficiaries of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s record purchase of Neymar.\nCoutinho never settled at Barcelona. His debut, in a Copa del Rey tie against Espanyol, showed all his skill, was capped by a nutmeg and celebrated by a fanbase eager for a new hero, but for all the will that he should succeed, it soon became apparent he was neither the new Neymar nor the new Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. He was simply not what Bar\u00e7a needed. An ageing midfield was already struggling to cover for an increasingly indulgent forward line. The structure was breaking down. His regains per game, a crude guide to how well a player is pressing, halved to 0.9 in his first full season there.\nThe defining games of that season were the two legs of the Champions League semi-final, against Liverpool. He was taken off after an hour of each and jeered on both occasions: by Barcelona fans who had come to see him as an emblem of the club\u2019s problems and by Liverpool fans revelling in the fact a player who had deserted them was on the receiving end of a historic comeback. This, Coutinho must have reflected, was the home he could have had, rather than becoming this wandering ghost.\nHe was loaned to Bayern, showed flickers of his best \u2013 a hat-trick against Werder Bremen, a brilliant performance against Paderborn, two symbolic late goals in the 8-2 win over Barcelona \u2013 but once the high-pressing Hansi Flick had replaced Niko Kovac as coach, Bayern were never going to sign him permanently. So it was back to Barcelona, where he found himself behind the 18-year-old Pedri in the pecking order, then suffered a knee injury that required surgery.\nHe is 29 and should be at the peak of his powers, but he fits nowhere. He has the ability and salary of a super-club player but he is not famous enough for the celebrity clubs and doesn\u2019t press well enough for the philosophy sides. As the pandemic hit finances across Europe, nobody could afford him. Once he would have been characterised as a luxury player, but who can afford luxuries these days?\nBar\u00e7a ended up desperate to offload his \u20ac20m-a-year salary so they could register Ferran Torres while complying with La Liga\u2019s salary cap. Coutinho, desperate to get back into the Brazil squad before the World Cup, reportedly accepted a 35% pay cut. Whether Villa needed another creator is debatable but Gerrard clearly still rates him and he is the sort of player who makes football fun \u2013 which, for an aspiring mid-table side, is a not insignificant attribute. But fun, as Everton found with James Rodr\u00edguez, can be unreliable.\nCoutinho\u2019s regains are now at 1.0 per game, 70% less than was managed in his final season at Villa by Jack Grealish, the player for whom he would seem a spiritual replacement. Coutinho could not be accommodated at Bar\u00e7a or Bayern but perhaps at Villa the team can be built for him, accentuating his ability and compensating for his flaws. Perhaps this is the level in the modern game for a player of his characteristics. Perhaps finally, after four years of drift, he has found a home. Perhaps.",

In Ewels\u2019 absence, Courtney Lawes shifted to second row at the scrum with Jack Nowell packing down at flanker but England comprehensively overpowered Ireland, earning six penalties.\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed the referee didn\u2019t allow us to scrum fully,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThat would be my only complaint, that we weren\u2019t allowed to play advantage away from the scrum \u2013 and there was no sign of a yellow card. If World Rugby want to have a scrum in the game they\u2019ve got to allow strong scrums to allow themselves to dominate so we\u2019re disappointed we didn\u2019t get more out of it.\u201d\nOn Ewels\u2019 second-minute dangerous tackle on James Ryan, who took no further part in the match, Jones added: \u201cHe\u2019s disappointed but no one apportions blame on him. It\u2019s a genuine attempt to make a good tackle, he just got his head in the wrong spot. We\u2019ve got no questions about the red card.\u201d\nDefeat means England are out of contention for the title and with a trip to grand slam-chasing France next week, Jones\u2019s side could finish fifth in the table for the second year in a row. They are set to be without Tom Curry, who limped off with a hamstring injury, as well as Ewels who is facing a ban and potentially Kyle Sinckler, who went off with concussion. The brave manner of their defeat, however, means the inquest is on hold for now with Maro Itoje, Ellis Genge and Nowell all standout performers despite Ireland eventually claiming their biggest ever win at Twickenham.\n\u201cI see that as a foundation game for us where we set our campaign for the World Cup in 2023,\u201d added Jones. \u201cThe spirit, the determination, the ability to work through problems were all absolutely outstanding. This pack is only going to get better and better. We want to be an old-fashioned England pack and a new-fashioned England attack. We\u2019re moving in a really solid progression towards that. There were 82,000 people there tonight that loved seeing the spirit of this team. It\u2019s a great learning experience for this team, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of them. We\u2019ll be right. We don\u2019t have a shortage of spirit. We\u2019ll get ourselves right and rip into France.\u201d\nIreland, meanwhile, will be crowned champions if they overcome Scotland and England do them a favour in Paris. Andy Farrell\u2019s side laboured at times with England, roared on by a raucous Twickenham crowd, threatening the most unlikely of victories but they wrapped up what could prove a key bonus point, which leaves them two points behind France in the table. \u201c[I\u2019m] over the moon,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cIf you\u2019d said that to us before the start we\u2019d have snatched your hand off. I\u2019m sure that England will recover well and take good heart from the great performance with 14 men and they\u2019ll look to finish the tournament very well themselves.\u201d",

England could really have done with his aerial prowess. 6\n14 Max Malins Had a hard time with Ireland always looking to release Lowe down his wing. 5\n13 Joe Marchant Rose to the challenge and made numerous contributions in defence. This could be a coming of age performance. 8\n12 Henry Slade Did not get the chance to offer much in attack but a robust performance in defence. He has had a consistent tournament. 6\n11 Jack Nowell Maybe he is a ninth forward after all, playing his part in a scrum that was dominant. Defended well down his wing. 7\n10 Marcus Smith Missed one penalty but was on target with the rest and kept Ireland\u2019s defence honest. His high kicks also yielded reward. 6\n9 Harry Randall Tried to make things happen with a few quick taps, though not really his game, and was no surprise to see Youngs on early. 6\n1 Ellis Genge Had Furlong on toast at scrum time, which is not bad for someone who supposedly has wobbles there, and ran and tackled himself to standstill. 9\n2 Jamie George His experience proved pivotal in settling England down after the Ewels dismissal. 8\n3 Kyle Sinckler Had been hampered by a back injury in the buildup and never looked right but fought valiantly. 6\n4 Maro Itoje Astonishing performance. Fired up during the anthems and led the rearguard once Ewels had gone off. Influence was obvious. 9\n5 Charlie Ewels A red card after 82 seconds for a dangerous tackle on Ryan. Can have no complaints. 2\n6 Courtney Lawes (capt) All his teammates talk about what a laid-back, calm captain he is and his cool head was key to keeping England in the game. 7\n7 Tom Curry Compounded England\u2019s woes when he went off with a hamstring injury after 15 minutes. 5\n8 Sam Simmonds Got through plenty of work in defence, tackling his heart out. No opportunities to show what he can do in attack. 7\nREPLACEMENTS\nJamie Blamire (for George, 80) N/A; Joe Marler (for Genge, 67) Got stuck in 6; Will Stuart (for Sinckler, 38) 7; Joe Launchbury (for Dombrandt, 67) Peripheral 5; Alex Dombrandt (for Curry, 15) Was later hooked 5; Ben Youngs (for Randall, 52) 6; George Ford (for Stewart, 80) N/A; Elliot Daly (for Marchant, 70) N/A\n15 Hugo Keenan Ran an unstoppable line for Ireland\u2019s second try and composed under the high ball.

Reliable presence Ireland needed as match wore on. 7\n13 Garry Ringrose Showed some lovely flashes but no more than that and would have hoped to find the ball in space more often than he did. 6\n12 Bundee Aki His running can be such a threat \u2013 particularly when the opposition is a man light \u2013 but Ireland\u2019s indiscipline limited his effect. 6\n11 James Lowe Finished off the first try with England shellshocked. Gave away a few penalties but his power caused problems. 8\n10 Johnny Sexton Tried trademark wrap-around move to exploit numerical advantage but main strength was his patience as England rallied. 7\n9 Jamison Gibson-Park Quick-thinking led to Keenan\u2019s try and showed moments of quality when it mattered. Has made the No 9 jersey his own. 9\n1 Cian Healy Struggled against Sinckler at the scrum and taken off early. Not his afternoon and Ireland badly missed Andrew Porter. 3\n2 Dan Sheehan A force to be reckoned with ball in hand and no complaints with his lineout work. Part of a front-row outgunned at the scrum. 7\n3 Tadhg Furlong Repeatedly pinged at the scrum and could not make his usual impact in the loose. Kept plugging away though. 4\n4 Tadhg Beirne Did not have his usual impact at the breakdown and was guilty of some handling errors at times. 6\n5 James Ryan Lasted just over a minute before Ewels\u2019 tackle ended his afternoon.

        "content": "The final instalment of this series opener in Antigua played out with a carnival atmosphere in the stands and commendable doggedness from both sides out in the middle until weary handshakes eventually arrived at 5.34pm local time.\nOver the course of five days, on a largely lifeless surface, the players had given their all. And in the end, West Indies had the cool heads of Nkrumah Bonner (38) and Jason Holder (37) to thank, the pair holding firm for 144 minutes of defiance to take their side to 147 for four from 70.1 overs after England had set a target of 286.\nThis was an unfamiliar territory for Joe Root\u2019s tourists during their winter of discontent, with the captain\u2019s 24th Test century \u2013 109 from 204 balls \u2013 affording him the rare luxury of a declaration at 349 for six shortly before lunch. It felt bold at the time, not least after losing Mark Wood to the elbow injury that puts his tour in doubt.\nJack Leach stood up for his captain here, claiming figures of three for 57 from 30.1 overs on the final day despite his main encouragement coming from the cage of catchers around the bat, rather than the surface. Ben Stokes was the standout seamer, notching up 13 overs of grunt work and 41 overall in a match where the all-rounder was supposed to be used sparingly.\nEngland were certainly in the ascendancy when Bonner and Holder came together after tea and West Indies had slipped to 67 for four. It came through a combination of Leach\u2019s persistence, the muscle of Stokes, and a couple of shots that had head coach Phil Simmons rolling his eyes on the home team\u2019s room balcony.\nThings had looked fairly benign out in the middle when Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell put on a 59-run partnership for the first wicket. Indeed it took a typical intervention from Stokes to separate them, the all-rounder pounding in from the Sir Andy Roberts end and pinning Brathwaite lbw for 33 with one that finally kept low.\nThis breakthrough was then compounded instantly when Campbell decided to take on Leach next over, only to pick out Craig Overton at mid-on. As a brain fade it rivalled the subsequent dismissal of his fellow Jamaican Jermaine Blackwood, when the No 5 played an awful swipe on two and was struck in front by Leach.\nIn between came the loss of Shamarh Brooks on the stroke of tea when Leach found a smidgeon of turn, the edge of the right-hander\u2019s bat and Zak Crawley pouched a fine low catch at slip. Having earlier grassed Campbell on one \u2013 and reprieved Bonner on 73 during his first innings century \u2013 his relief was palpable.\nA more diligent approach followed from Bonner and Holder, however, hunkering down for the second time in the match. England were patient and resourceful, even if Chris Woakes and Craig Overton were largely neutered and the loopy spin of Dan Lawrence threatened more.\nBut they were also left to rue Root\u2019s decision not to use his final review in the 49th over when Leach pinned Holder on the back foot offering no shot on 13 and Hawkeye returned three reds.\nWhen the England captain instead used this for a caught behind off Holder four overs later and snicko showed no spike, further agony followed. And so while England\u2019s depleted attack surpassed the incredible energy levels of the local drummers on the grass bank, they hobbled off at the close with a tinge of regret.\nThis final outcome was not entirely unexpected when, at 11.38am local time, Root leaned out of the dressing room window and waved in Jonny Bairstow and Woakes. The pair added a sprightly seventh-wicket stand of 35 that calmed the seas after England lost four wickets in five overs during their pursuit of quick runs.\nRoot had earlier turned his overnight 84 into three figures, slotting six fours in a frictionless cruise and marking the milestone by kissing a necklace made by his children back home. He was also celebrating his 13th hundred as captain \u2013 surpassing the previous England record of 12 made by predecessor Alastair Cook \u2013 and a first since the end of last summer.\nHe and Crawley had also put on 201 runs for the second wicket, the latter adding four runs to the 117 he had so elegantly stroked the previous day only for Holder to detonate his off-stump with a lasered yorker. Lawrence then played a little gem of an innings, injecting impetus into proceedings with a 36-ball 37 and perhaps auditioning for Strictly down the line, such was his footwork and timing.\nFrom 310 for three there was a wobble, Alzarri Joseph nipping in to claim three of the four middle order wickets to fall. But once the calm heads of Woakes and Bairstow had set up a satisfactory equation for their captain, it was over to Root\u2019s bowlers to see if they could somehow force a positive result.\nThat they were in this position, and had seen three batters in Bairstow, Crawley and Root make centuries during this hard-fought series opener, pointed to, if not a total reset, then some green shoots of recovery on the road.",

        "content": "Frank Lampard\u2019s side are in real trouble after the drubbing at Spurs but young attacker thinks they will escape\nFrank Lampard clearly suspected things could get worse for Everton when he dissected the first home defeat of his short reign, against Manchester City. But how much worse, and how quickly, will have alarmed a manager who has projected confidence from the moment he was tasked with avoiding the club\u2019s first relegation in 71 years.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look too much at the table for the next few weeks,\u201d he said a fortnight ago. \u201cI am not buying time with that, we have a lot of points to play for. If we play with the energy and passion we did today, my feeling is, we will be fine.\u201d Then came Tottenham, and a performance so abject that Everton looked condemned at Premier League level. Two home games in the next five days, against Wolves on Sunday and Newcastle on Thursday, will have a major bearing on the final verdict.\n\u201cI am not going to lie and say I don\u2019t look at the table,\u201d says Anthony Gordon, the homegrown forward who has sparkled in the rough this season. \u201cI am a human being and I check the scores after games. We are very aware of the position we are in. What choice do we have? It is our fault we are there. We have got to fight.\n\u201cTottenham was the lowest I\u2019ve felt all season. It was probably one of the lowest I\u2019ve felt in my career. I think it was the heaviest defeat I\u2019ve suffered. I haven\u2019t been the easiest person to be around over the last few days but I\u2019ve still got the same work ethic and am still doing all the right things. I\u2019m ready to go again.\u201d\nIn cold Premier League terms there has been no managerial bounce since Lampard succeeded Rafael Ben\u00edtez five weeks ago. Four defeats in five top-flight games represents a deflating start, although the new manager\u2019s record reads three wins in seven matches with FA Cup victories against Brentford and non-league Boreham Wood included.\nThere has, however, been a marked improvement in the intensity, organisation and overall quality of Everton\u2019s home performances. An instant connection between Lampard and the Everton fanbase has turned Goodison Park from a toxic environment into an asset once again. With seven home league games remaining, and the \u201cnight and day\u201d contrast with their away form, as Lampard described it on Monday, it is clear where potential salvation lies.\n\u201cNot many teams have the fanbase we have,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cSo when you experience games at Goodison the atmosphere is incredible. It gives players a massive boost. It is like that all over the league but even more so with us because of the massive fanbase. Away from home I put it down to us having a tough season, the squad has lost confidence over time, and it can be tough to go away without confidence.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep making the same mistakes. The good teams don\u2019t make the same mistakes twice. It\u2019s got to be top performance after top performance and that takes character and togetherness within the team. It\u2019s difficult because I don\u2019t think you can build character \u2013 it has to be already in you. It\u2019s about having your own individual pride as a player \u2013 1 to 11. If you\u2019ve got that then you\u2019ll be fine. We just need to stick together and bring it out of each other more. It\u2019s about taking that little bit of responsibility yourself and holding each other accountable. If we do that, then we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nSome have been ludicrously quick to pin the very real threat of relegation on Lampard, as though five weeks with a team that had collected six points from the previously available 42 before he arrived is long enough to address six years of damaging mismanagement under Farhad Moshiri. The same critics shovel the falsehood that Ben\u00edtez was hounded out of Everton because of his Liverpool history, when it was appalling results, performances and internal divisions that did for the most misguided of managerial appointments. That is also on Moshiri who, along with trying to finance the new \u00a3500m-plus stadium at Bramley Moore dock, has had to cut commercial sponsorship ties with his business associate the oligarch Alisher Usmanov as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. A first relegation since 1951 would have dire financial consequences for a club already navigating Premier League profit and sustainability rules.\nThis is not to give Lampard a free pass for Monday\u2019s drubbing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He was visibly shocked by events; those who have seen Everton concede five goals or more in a game eight times over the past five seasons, less so. He attributed the 5-0 loss to individual errors and bad defending. Both are long-term failings. No Premier League team have conceded more own goals than Everton\u2019s four this season or made more errors leading to a goal than their eight.\nBut a gameplan that exposed a weak Everton defence to Spurs\u2019 well-honed counterattack and failed to yield a shot on target for the second away game in succession, also contributed to an 11th consecutive Premier League trip without a win.\n\u201cEvery gameplan we\u2019ve had has been right and that comes from the manager and his staff preparing us well. I\u2019m not just saying that, it\u2019s really my opinion,\u201d Gordon says. \u201cBut as players I feel we\u2019ve let him and the staff down by losing our heads a bit and going away from the gameplan when things get tough.\u201d\nThe 21-year-old is as spirited and impressive when interviewed as he has been on the pitch during a breakthrough season at Everton. Having grown up in Kirkdale, close to Goodison, he is acutely aware of the criticism that followed the heavy defeat at Spurs. \u201cI can totally understand why people might think we don\u2019t care but football is our life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe give everything to it. If you look at it from that perspective, it\u2019s stupid to think a player doesn\u2019t care.\n\u201cWe are in here day in, day out. We eat right, we sleep right, we give our lives to it. Everyone here cares. It\u2019s a massive deal and we\u2019re striving together. It\u2019s a difficult period, but tough times bring out the best in people.\u201d\nDoes he not worry that this tough period will end in relegation? \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cBecause I see how good we can be. And it\u2019s really annoying. To see us not do that week in, week out is really disappointing but I know we can do it, so I don\u2019t have any worry. If we just get certain things right then all the worry will disappear.\u201d",

        "content": "Club go into Sunday\u2019s game with Arsenal looking increasingly solid, and will be hoping to end a patchy season on a high\nIn return for a taste of his whisky, no less, singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers was once given some awfully vague advice: \u201cThe secret to survivin\u2019,\u201d the Gambler told him on a train bound for nowhere, \u201cis knowin\u2019 what to throw away and knowin\u2019 what to keep.\u201d Thanks for that, Gambler, care to elaborate? \u201cYou\u2019re got to know when to hold \u2019em, know when to fold \u2019em.\u201d Yes, Gambler, but how?\nThe boards of Leicester and Arsenal may have found themselves humming that tune earlier this season when they heard calls to sack their managers. The cries for Brendan Rodgers to be strapped into a train bound for Mutualconsentville never got as loud as the ones aimed at Mikel Arteta but there were mumblings among some fans, nonetheless, that he may have reached the end of the line with Leicester. Giving up the FA Cup by losing 4-1 to Nottingham Forest in February was a low point from which it was hard to return. But Leicester, like Arsenal, knew what not to throw away and as the clubs prepare to meet at the Emirates on Sunday, each can be satisfied that they are now stronger.\nOn Friday, Rodgers praised Arsenal for sticking with Arteta but he could easily have been talking about himself and Leicester when he said: \u201cThey supported him, which is great. He\u2019s a really gifted coach and they\u2019ve shown patience.\u201d Rodgers has earned patience during his term at Leicester and he has now got his team into a state where they could do the reverse of the last two campaigns by ending strongly.\nMost of Leicester\u2019s problems have been caused by injuries. Those are starting to abate at last, with even the brilliant young centre-back Wesley Fofana scheduled to make his first appearance of the season next week. Rodgers has suggested that the prospect of the Frenchman returning may partly explain why Daniel Amartey and Caglar Soyuncu have suddenly become so solid in recent weeks. \u201cSometimes the best coach is competition,\u201d said Rodgers, underplaying his own contribution \u2013 because adjustments made by the manager are the other reason why Leicester go into Sunday\u2019s match having kept three consecutive clean sheets for the first time this season.\nRodgers has tightened up his team by slightly curbing his attacking instincts, prioritising solidity and dynamism. \u201cWe had to get back to what we\u2019re all about,\u201d said Rodgers. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall on the left-hand side of midfield and the indefatigable Marc Albrighton on the right have been instrumental in that, their energy and doggedness helping to stimulate upturns in form from Youri Tielemans, Wilfred Ndidi and the centre-backs. Leicester have become a coherent, resilient whole again, able to stay in game even when not playing particularly well. Not only have they avoided conceding in their last three matches, they have struck last-minute goals in two of them, at Burnley two weeks ago and against Rennes on Thursday.\n\u201cSpeaking to one of the French outlets after that game, they felt we looked much stronger than Rennes and our game experience showed at the end,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThat was good to hear from people who maybe don\u2019t watch as much of us but saw how we managed the game. We\u2019ve had some harsh lessons this year in terms of giving away late goals. You can take that as long as you go away and learn. That\u2019s part of how we\u2019re evolving.\u201d\nIt will be interesting to see what evolution means for James Maddison. Having regained his form and excelled, he suffered a minor injury that cost him his starting place last month. Since then his role has been as a high-impact substitute, sent on to dazzle on a stage built by more dynamic players. His creativity is undeniable, his effect on the team\u2019s balance more difficult to define. \u201cWe have to pick a team that isn\u2019t just for the best players,\u201d says Rodgers.\nOne player practically certain to start against Arsenal is Harvey Barnes. Having overcome the fitness problems that hampered him earlier in the season, the 24-year-old has found such consistency that he has become Leicester\u2019s most thrilling attacker and also less predictable to opponents. \u201cThere were certain elements of his game where when he got into certain positions you could probably read what he was going to do \u2013 but now you can\u2019t,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cNow he comes inside or he can bend the ball in or fake to come into the first post. Or he looks like he\u2019s coming inside but goes outside. That\u2019s just the development of his game, through training, coaching and his own analysis and constant work.\n\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s going to create and score in every game he plays. And the balance of the team is really good. The two players on the left side \u2013 Luke [Thomas], Kiernan \u2013 they feed him early. It\u2019s great to see.\u201d",

        "content": "Conflict in Ukraine means January\u2019s GDP boost is unlikely to last, but Threadneedle Street still seems obsessed with curbing inflation\nSoaring gas and electricity prices, high inflation, the worst squeeze for living standards in decades \u2026 The economic outlook was challenging even before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Now conflict on European soil and economic warfare through sanctions has added to the pressure.\nThis week the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, as the war pushes up already high energy prices. It will be adding to the cost-of-living crisis by increasing the cost of borrowing, but the idea is to stop high rates of inflation becoming more permanent.\nThreadneedle Street\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to vote for a rise from 0.5% to 0.75%, lifting borrowing costs back to pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Some of its more hawkish members may push for a bigger rise, to 1%, which would be the highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis.\nWhile all of this was likely before the first Russian tank rolled into Ukraine, Vladimir Putin\u2019s war has complicated an already delicate balancing act for the central bank.\nWith the impact of western sanctions and Russian countermeasures driving up the cost of oil and gas on international markets, inflation is now set to peak at higher than the 7.25% forecast by the Bank for April, and stay at elevated levels for longer than first thought.\nSome economists have spoken of inflation peaking close to 10%, compounding an already bitter cost-of-living crisis by adding to energy bills and driving up the cost of petrol and diesel to record levels.\nUntil Putin\u2019s invasion, Britain\u2019s economy was holding up better than had been expected. Official figures show gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a faster rate in January than City economists had forecast, with a 0.8% rebound on the month from the Omicron-driven dip in activity seen at the end of 2021.\nEmployment has continued to rise despite the end of the furlough scheme, and companies are still warning of shortages of workers and materials despite some signs of supply chain problems caused by Covid gradually fading.\nHowever, it\u2019s probable that growth in the opening months of the year was as good as it will get for some time, given the impact of the war on wholesale energy prices and supply lines. With households facing a harsher squeeze, consumer spending is expected to suffer, which will be a drag on economic growth.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs anticipate growth of about 1.2% in the first quarter of 2022, similar to the summer of last year, when the easing of pandemic restrictions helped repair some of the damage caused by Covid. However, GDP in the second quarter is expected to come in at only 0.4%.\nAccording to analysts at UBS, every 10% increase in the price of fuel, electricity and gas has the effect of cutting about 0.3 percentage points from household spending and 0.2 percentage points from GDP growth. Some economists warn that a worst-case scenario of soaring oil prices and energy bills could even tip the UK economy into recession later this year.\nSeveral people have therefore been asking whether the Bank should plough ahead with rate rises when the economy is slowing. Raising borrowing costs has little impact on global energy prices, and such powerful headwinds will take some of the steam out of the UK economy without the need for higher rates.\nEconomists believe Threadneedle Street will continue to prioritise keeping a lid on inflation over providing more support to the economy. However, with households facing the worst squeeze in incomes since at least the 1970s, it will need to tread very carefully.",

In February 2021, on his watch, a failure of the state energy grid during cold weather contributed to hundreds of deaths.\nO\u2019Rourke is a former congressman and candidate for both US Senate and the Democratic presidential nomination. On Saturday, he spoke at the SXSW festival in Austin, the state capital.\nSpeaking to Evan Smith, a co-founder of the Texas Tribune newspaper, O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cI just had a chance to meet with the ambassador from the [European Union]. We talked about the fact that you\u2019re seeing the continued rise of authoritarians and thugs across the world. And we have our own, right here, in the state of Texas.\u201d\nSmith asked: \u201cGreg Abbott is a thug in your mind?\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke said: \u201cHe\u2019s a thug, he\u2019s an authoritarian. Let me make the case.\n\u201cNot only could this guy, through his own incompetence, not keep the lights on in the energy capital of the planet last February, but when people like Kelcy Warren and other energy company CEOs made \u2026 $11bn in profit over five days \u2013 selling gas for 200 times the going rate \u2013 not only did [Abbott] not claw back those illegal profits, not only was there no justice for more than 700 people who were killed \u2013 who literally froze to death in their homes, outside, in their cars, people who are paying now tens of billions of dollars cumulatively to pay for the property damage that the flooding that ensued caused in their homes \u2013 but he\u2019s taking millions of dollars in payoffs from these same people.\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s got his own oligarch here in the state of Texas.\u201d\nRussian oligarchs, billionaire businessmen who control fortunes often based on natural resources and work closely with Putin, have been subject to severe sanctions in the west since their president ordered the invasion of Ukraine last month.\nAs the Texas Tribune reported, the state of Texas says 246 people died in the power grid failure in 2021 but other analysis has placed the figure as high as 702.\nThe paper also pointed out that Warren, a co-founder of Energy Transfer, an oil pipeline company, recently sued O\u2019Rourke for defamation. Warren did not immediately comment on Saturday. O\u2019Rourke has called the lawsuit \u201cfrivolous\u201d.\nAccording to testimony from a Texas power grid manager, energy prices were kept high in the aftermath of the failure as a way to incentivise private companies to avoid more blackouts.\nIn a statement, Abbott\u2019s campaign said: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate Beto O\u2019Rourke continues to run a campaign based on fear-mongering and tearing down Texas.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke also linked Abbott to Putin when discussing a new elections law which critics say seeks to reduce participation among those likely to vote Democratic.\n\u201cYou think this stuff only exists in Russia or in other parts of the world?\u201d said O\u2019Rourke. \u201cIt\u2019s happening right here. You think they rig elections in other parts of the planet? It is the toughest state in the nation in which to vote, right here.\u201d\nTexas has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994 but progressives see hope in demographic change. O\u2019Rourke showed strongly in his US Senate race in 2018, losing narrowly to the Republican Ted Cruz. But his run for the presidency went nowhere.\nThe Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey\u2019s decision not to run for governor cleared O\u2019Rourke\u2019s path but Realclearpolitics.com on Saturday put Abbott up by 8.8% in its polling average. Fivethirtyeight.com showed Abbott up by between 5% and 11%.\nOn Saturday, O\u2019Rourke said he would seek to work with Republicans on gun control reform, strong remarks on the subject having proved unpopular with Texans in 2020. He also discussed immigration and Joe Biden \u2013 who he said was \u201cnot a drag on anyone\u201d.\nMark Miner, Abbott\u2019s communications director, said: \u201cIt appears if you want Beto to tell the truth, you need to put him in front of out-of-state liberal elitists, not the people of Texas.\u201d",

And what happens if he fails with conventional weapons? Will he use unconventional ones next?\nIt\u2019s the right question. It\u2019s just four years too late. Because he\u2019s already used unconventional weapons. Not in Ukraine, but right here, in Britain. On 4 March 2018, Putin deployed a chemical weapon against a civilian population. Our civilian population. Us.\nThe poisoning of Sergei Skripal may have played out in the British press as a \u201cbotched assassination attempt\u201d, but that\u2019s just half of a more terrifying story. Because Salisbury is not just a pretty, quintessentially English market town with a famous cathedral, which Skripal\u2019s poisoners mocked us with when they claimed to have visited it. It\u2019s also a home to the British military establishment, and some of its highest ranking officers, adjoining the biggest military training ground in Britain, Salisbury Plain.\nAnd Putin struck at its heart. Was it Skripal he was after? Or Salisbury? Or, as it turned out, both? Because two Russian soldiers \u2013 military intelligence officers from the GRU agency \u2013 caught a commercial flight to London, sauntered down a Salisbury street without making any effort to disguise themselves, in full view of 100 or more security cameras, and released a deadly nerve agent. And then? Then they threw away the bottle.\nThree months later, an Amesbury resident, Charlie Rowley, fished it out of a charity bin and gave it to his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess. She died, agonisingly. This was a British citizen murdered by the Kremlin.\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s worse. What if she hadn\u2019t been given the vial? What if the bottle had gone to the charity shop? Or into a bin lorry? Or been crushed and taken to the tip? Or had entered the water table?\nIn a recent interview, Fiona Hill, formerly the national security adviser on Russia to Donald Trump, makes her thoughts on the incident plain. \u201cThere was enough nerve agent in that bottle to kill several thousand people,\u201d she said. It proved Putin was prepared to use any \u201ccruel and unusual weapon\u201d he has, she said. \u201cAnd he wants us to know that.\u201d\nHe wants us to know that. And, by Hill\u2019s analysis, the poisoning of Sergei Skripal looks less like a \u201cbotched assassination attempt\u201d and more like a botched terror attack. At the very least it was a stark, unmistakable message from Russia to Nato, the very definition of hybrid warfare: a combined military and information operation.\nCertainly, governments around the world read it as such. It was an seen as an attack on Nato. There was unprecedented international cooperation: Nato agreed and imposed sanctions. Hundreds of Russian \u201cdiplomats\u201d \u2013 spies \u2013 were expelled from embassies around the world.\nBut what we now must recognise is that the British government\u2019s response to the Skripal poisoning, and specifically Boris Johnson\u2019s role in it, was a glaring national security failure.\nTo understand this, we need to rewind a few months earlier. On 30 October 2017, the FBI made it known that its investigation into Russian interference in the US election, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, had begun in London. Two days later, on 1 November, the Labour MP Chris Byrant asked Johnson, then foreign secretary, whether he had seen any evidence of Russian interference in British elections. \u201cNot a sausage,\u201d he said. \u201cNiet.\u201d\nYet two weeks later Theresa May, then prime minister, made a landmark speech at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet: \u201cRussia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what you are doing. And you will not succeed.\u201d She also detailed how Russia had mounted \u201ca sustained campaign of cyber, espionage and corruption. This has included meddling in elections.\u201d And, crucially, she acknowledged the \u201cweaponising\u201d of information via social media, Russia\u2019s information warfare that was a significant part of the FBI\u2019s investigation. Three months later, Putin sent her a weapons grade nerve agent on a Moscow-London Aeroflot flight.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. Because that April, Johnson flew to Nato\u2019s headquarters in Brussels and met the US secretary of state and the rest of the alliance\u2019s foreign ministers: it was a crucial, highly sensitive meeting to discuss how Nato would deal with Russia ahead of its July summit.\nA year later, the Guardian would reveal that Johnson had travelled directly from that summit to the Italian villa of Evgeny Lebedev, the UK-based Russian newspaper proprietor. It published a photograph showing him alone and dishevelled at San Francesco d\u2019Assisi airport, no security in sight.\nAnd four months after that, in November 2019, we reported in the Observer a singular fact: that Alexander Lebedev, Evgeny\u2019s father, an ex-KGB officer, had flown in to join him. Anyone with any knowledge of Russian intelligence will tell you there is no such thing as an ex-KGB officer. But, as ever in Britain, we latch on to the wrong details at the wrong time: last week, following news reports, it became a scandal that Johnson had made Evgeny a lord against the advice of his own security services (he denies interfering in the appointment).\nOf course, it is. But the meeting with Alexander Lebedev is of another order. And it isn\u2019t a scandal, it\u2019s a national security failure. And it must now be investigated.\nThe meeting with Alexander Lebedev was undertaken without a security protocol, the knowledge of his department officials or, it must be assumed, the prime minister. And when it became known, Johnson should have not just been sacked, he should have been questioned by both the police and the prime minister. Except, by the time the Observer revealed it, Johnson was the prime minister.\nWe have to finally understand what has happened here. Russia\u2019s attack on our democracy has been covered up. It\u2019s what the parliamentary intelligence and security committee\u2019s Russia report revealed beyond all doubt. And all available evidence suggests this cover-up leads back to Johnson. It was Johnson who claimed there was \u201cnot a sausage\u201d of evidence. It was Johnson who suppressed the report\u2019s publication. And it was Johnson who had direct oversight of MI6 as foreign secretary when, as the report said, it \u201cactively avoided\u201d investigating.\nIt shouldn\u2019t have taken the prospect of a third world war to reveal this. And it didn\u2019t. It has been in plain sight for two and a half years. It is in plain sight now. And our national security depends on us all finally seeing it.",

The Anglo-Russian Opera and Ballet Trust, founded in 1992, raised millions for Russian arts organisations and boasted the Prince of Wales as its patron.\nThe charity was set up by conductor Valery Gergiev, a high-profile friend of Vladimir Putin, with the main goal of supporting St Petersburg\u2019s Mariinsky theatre \u2013 one of the best-known cultural institutions in Russia \u2013 and promoting its work in the UK.\nIt raised money for Mariinsky artists including Xander Parish, an East Yorkshire-born ballet star who joined the Mariinsky in 2010 and later became one of its principal dancers. Now, weeks shy of its 30-year milestone in April, the trust has been disbanded. References to it have been removed from the list of Prince Charles\u2019s affiliations on official royal websites, and the charity\u2019s website now carries the message: \u201cThe Mariinsky Theatre Trust [its working name] has closed down.\u201d\nThe charity \u2013 whose trustees include BP\u2019s former vice-president for Russia, Peter Charow, Labour MP Nick Brown and Elizabeth Smith, the life peer and widow of the former Labour leader \u2013 has not released a statement explaining the closure, but the move came days after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nA day earlier, Gergiev, the Mariinsky\u2019s director and one of Russia\u2019s biggest classical music stars, was dropped by La Scala opera house in Milan after he failed to denounce the invasion. He has since resigned as honorary president of the Edinburgh international festival and been fired by the Munich Philharmonic.\nThe 68-year-old conductor has been described as \u201cfiercely loyal\u201d to Putin, whom he reportedly meets five or six times a year, and expressed support for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Putin, who has called Gergiev \u201cone of the outstanding musicians of our time\u201d, pumped an estimated $700m into a new opera and ballet house, the Mariinsky II, which opened in 2013.\nAccording to its website, the Anglo-Russian Opera and Ballet Trust was created by Gergiev and combined \u201cpractical assistance for the Mariinsky theatre\u2019s work in Russia with active promotion of its most innovative programming in the UK\u201d.\nPrince Charles became its patron in 1999, and went on to be photographed alongside Gergiev in 2001. Musicians from the Mariinsky performed at his wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005.\nThe Charity Commission for England and Wales said that it had not yet been asked to remove the trust from its register, but last week the charity\u2019s number had been disconnected and emails went unanswered. Trustees were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales declined to comment, but confirmed that the trust had closed. This is the latest instance of the UK cutting ties to Russian cultural institutions after the invasion of Ukraine. Opera and ballet performances have been cancelled throughout the UK, including a planned residency by Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Opera House in London.\nIn St Petersburg, the show at the Mariinsky goes on, with performances of Swan Lake and operas by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Rossini among those scheduled for this month. But last week, Parish, the ballet company\u2019s star and first British dancer, announced his departure. The 35-year-old, who was awarded an OBE in 2017 for his services to dance and UK-Russia relations, said in a social media post on Monday that due to the \u201cawful crisis\u201d he had decided to leave Russia, \u201cat least until peace comes\u201d.\nHe added that he was \u201cso grateful to the Mariinsky\u201d, which had given him \u201ca career in classical ballet I could only have dreamed about\u201d, and paid tribute to \u201cwonderful ordinary Russian people, the majority of whom have treated me with such kindness.\n\u201cI pray that peace will come and the wounds will be healed by God\u2019s grace. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.\u201d\n This article was amended on 14 March 2022 because an earlier version, in one instance, referred to Gergiev as a composer, and in another as a conductor.

        "content": "The son of an insurance broker is now England\u2019s leading jockey, and is targeting more success at this week\u2019s Cheltenham Festival\nWhen Nico de Boinville was at public boarding school in Berkshire, while Best Mate was winning three Gold Cups in succession at the Cheltenham Festival between 2002 and 2004, he bunked off classes in an early sign of his obsession with horse racing. \u201cI definitely snuck out of a couple of lessons to watch Best Mate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was then that Cheltenham came on my radar, because before that I was massively into Flat racing.\u201d\nThe 32-year-old jockey, who is English racing\u2019s best hope of challenging the domination of the annual Irish invasion at Cheltenham this coming week, laughs when asked if he would have been joined by any other rebellious public schoolboys during his illicit Festival-watching. \u201cNot at all. No one else was fussed. It was all football and only I followed the racing.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, De Boinville rides the imperious Shishkin in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, which promises to be the most compelling race of the week. Shishkin\u2019s victory over Energumene, from the mighty Irish yard of Willie Mullins, lit up Ascot in January and the swift resumption of their rivalry is an enticing prospect. De Boinville is on Constitution Hill in the opening race of the Festival on Tuesday, the Supreme Novices\u2019 Hurdle, and he again has an outstanding horse on which to try to stem the tide of Irish winners.\nBut it\u2019s intriguing to hear about De Boinville\u2019s unlikely journey into racing and how, with his privileged and very different background to most of his peers, he has established himself as a leading English jockey. His mother and father, who was an insurance broker, pushed him towards further education and De Boinville accepted a place to study politics and history at Newcastle University. Those interests remain and help explain why we cover many subjects including the history of Ukraine and the mentality of Vladimir Putin as De Boinville\u2019s intelligence shines out. But he understood almost instantly that university was a pale imitation of a vivid racing life and dropped out after six weeks.\n\u201cI knew straight away, as soon as I walked in, that it wasn\u2019t going to last long,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a bit of a shame because I\u2019m sure if it was a condensed course I would have really enjoyed it. It just seemed very strung out.\u201d\nWere his parents willing to give him time to establish himself in racing? \u201cVery much so. The timelines were set by myself. I said: \u2018You\u2019ve got until you\u2019re 25 to see what you can do.\u2019 I\u2019m very much a realist, even now.\u201d\nPlumpton 1.00 Jazz King 1.35 Ballinsker 2.10 Kansas City Chief 2.45 One For Dunstan 3.20 Sainte Doctor (nap) 3.55 Tommy Dillion (nb)\nStratford-On-Avon 1.45 Raffles Gitane 2.20 Interne De Sivola 2.55 Corran Cross 3.30 Osprey Call 4.05 Envoye Special 4.40 Rambo T\nTaunton 2.00 Highstakesplayer 2.35 Apothicaire 3.10 Some Detail 3.45 Amelia\u2019s Dance 4.20 Majestic Merlin 4.50 Sindabella\u00a0\nWolverhampton 5.00 Plumette 5.30 Sweet Bertie 6.00 Progressive 6.30 Eternal Summer 7.00 Catbird Seat 7.30 It\u2019s A Love Thing\nDe Boinville\u2019s limited experience of working with racehorses had been obtained during his gap year in France. \u201cI wanted to improve my French and I spent time with Richard Gibson [an English trainer based in France]. It was a fantastic stepping stone and he taught me an awful lot.\u201d\nNicky Henderson agreed to take De Boinville on at his Seven Barrows yard but it was a lowly position. \u201cI was the fourth amateur rider because there was a host of young wannabe jockeys and we all started as stable staff trying to work our way up. It was highly competitive and we tried to learn from Barry [Geraghty] and AP [McCoy], who rode for Nicky. I kept my mouth shut and just watched and learned. As you progressed, you could start to ask questions, but in the beginning they were not looking twice at an amateur Mr Posh de Boinville.\u201d\nDe Boinville struggled and between May 2009 and April 2012 he had two winners in 30 rides. \u201cIt was tough. I hadn\u2019t done any pony racing and I didn\u2019t have any real experience coming into a big yard like Seven Barrows. David Bass [now his close friend] turned up at the same time and he\u2019d had 200 rides point-to-pointing.\u201d\nAt the age of 22 De Boinville handed in his notice with the intention of moving back to France. \u201cI was down in the dumps and fully prepared to head back to France and give it a go there.\u201d\nHenderson, an Old Etonian, is even posher than De Boinville. But he saw something else in the riding and sheer character of the former public schoolboy. He refused to accept De Boinville\u2019s departure and, slowly, the opportunities came. He rode at Cheltenham in 2012 and picked up his first Festival winner on Whisper in the Coral Cup in 2014. A year later his life was transformed when he surprisingly won the Gold Cup on Coneygee, a novice chaser from a small yard trained by Mark Bradstock.\n\u201cI only lost my claim [under the handicapping rules that favour apprentice jockeys] the month before so it was a fantastic story. I owe so much to Mark and Sara [Bradstock] because lots of people were pushing them not to keep me on the horse for the Gold Cup. They put an awful lot of faith in me and what a shout to go and run a novice in the Gold Cup. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be done again. I\u2019ve had a few more stabs at the Gold Cup and I know how hard it is to win.\u201d\nJon Pullin, the new clerk of the course at Cheltenham, said on Sunday that the fields for the opening day of the track\u2019s Festival meeting on Tuesday are \u201cvery competitive \u2026 with numbers of runners comparable to or higher [than] recent years\u201d \u2013 even though the National Hunt Chase, the final event on the card, has attracted just seven runners, its smallest field this century.\nFor the second year running, 10 will go to post for the Champion Hurdle, which is in line with the 10-year average, while a 12-runner field for the Mares\u2019 Hurdle is the second-largest in the last five years. An 11-strong field for the Arkle Trophy is also well ahead of the five runners in 2021, as well as the 10-year average of 8.2.\u00a0\nHowever, the seven-runner field for the National Hunt Chase is the first in single figures this century, for a race which attracted 26 runners in 2002 and has a 10-year average of 16.5. The Supreme Novice Hurdle, meanwhile, has nine declared runners, one more than in 2021 but well below the 10-year average of 15.7.\u00a0\nDirect comparisons with last year\u2019s Festival are potentially misleading, as owners were banned from attending due to Covid-19 restrictions. This may have persuaded some owners with unfancied or so-called \u201csocial\u201d runners to bypass the meeting.\u00a0\nHowever, the small field for the National Hunt Chase, which has attracted just two runners from British stables, will still come as a surprise to many punters \u2013 not least when the idea of expanding the meeting to five days is again being floated in some quarters.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe going for the first day of the Festival, meanwhile, is expected to be good-to-soft, after plans to continue watering the track were put on hold following 4mm of rain overnight on Saturday. No further rain is forecast for the track until Wednesday, while Thursday and Friday are expected to be dry and mild.\u00a0\n\"We'll monitor conditions and see how much it dries before making any decision on any further watering,\u201d Pullin.\"Given where we are currently and the forecast ahead, we will be somewhere around good-to-soft for the start of the meeting.\u00a0\n\"There is a little bit of rain on the radar for Wednesday at the moment, so we are keeping an eye on that. At the moment it looks like 2-3mm and then Thursday and Friday are looking dry, bright and sunny and temperatures up to 14C.\u201d Greg Wood\nDe Boinville pauses when I ask how difficult it was to gain acceptance in the uncompromising and often insular weighing room. \u201cWhen I started with Richard Gibson he said: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t speak French. If you can speak horse language you will go far.\u2019 That\u2019s how it is in our sport. If you can ride, people respect you. You\u2019ve just got to get on with people and I like to think that I do and I\u2019m quite open and honest. It also helped that I never felt typecast.\u201d\nWhat does he think of the weighing-room culture now \u2013 especially in the wake of Bryony Frost being bullied by Robbie Dunne? \u201cIt\u2019s progressed hugely and some jockeys are driving that forward. Obviously the past couple of years we\u2019ve had issues that needed addressing. But we\u2019re all doing our utmost to make sure we\u2019ve learned from those mistakes.\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s about being kind and accepting of our colleagues. But at the same time we are in a dangerous elite sport and there will be flare ups. But we\u2019ll get to a point where we can manage these situations correctly \u2013 with open and honest discussion.\u201d\nThe solicitor representing Dunne during the bullying tribunal indicated he had been defended by senior jockeys, including De Boinville and Richard Johnson. Was that the case? \u201cSome of us in the weighing room tried to resolve these issues before they got so far out of hand they became public knowledge,\u201d De Boinville says. \u201cBoth of them wanted to talk to me. I did give my advice to Bryony and to Robbie. All I advised was to have an open and honest discussion. That wasn\u2019t to be but I still get on well with Robbie and Bryony.\u201d\nDoes Frost feel welcomed in the weighing room again? \u201cShe went through a very difficult period and perhaps she did feel like an outsider. But from what I\u2019ve observed over the past few months, she\u2019s felt much more part of the weighing room again.\n\u201cThere will be disputes and we don\u2019t all have to get on. We are our own self-employed businesses so it doesn\u2019t have to be one big happy family. But we have to respect our fellow jockeys and ensure we can ride iron-to-iron and be safe with them.\u201d\nDe Boinville could be riding iron-to-iron alongside Paul Townend, his Irish contemporary, when Shishkin and Energumene go head to head in the Champion Chase. His face lights up when remembering their battle at Ascot.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an awful lot of hype, like at Ascot, you hope to God you put up your best performance and produce something special, because it\u2019s very rare that two horses come together at their peak. That\u2019s what excited people because these are two exceptional racehorses who put up amazing performances. I felt incredibly privileged to be a part of it, let alone win it.\u201d\nShishkin made two small mistakes before seizing victory. \u201cIt probably looked a lot worse than when I was on him because we were going so fast down that hill. But Shishkin can always pull something out of the bag when he\u2019s on the back foot. He certainly did it when we won the Supreme [at the 2020 Festival]. We were all but knocked out and he found a way to come back and win. That was very similar to Ascot and when you get that feeling from a crowd it\u2019s very rare. The only other time I can think of the crowd engaging with a racehorse so deeply was when Sprinter Sacre won at Cheltenham that October he came back [from a heart problem in 2015].\u201d\nDe Boinville used to be the work rider for Sprinter Sacre before he graduated to being his race jockey and they won the Champion Chase together in 2016. How do Sprinter and Shishkin compare? \u201cSprinter was a flamboyant showboater. He was your Naseem Hamed whereas Shiskhin is not as flash. But he\u2019s got an incredible talent.\u201d\nDe Boinville has peppered our conversation with boxing references. \u201cI really enjoy boxing. They are not so different, boxers and jockeys. We are laying it all out for everyone to see and there is no hiding place.\u201d\nIt does not take long before De Boinville returns to discussing Ukraine. \u201cGoing back through the history of it is very, very interesting and I read Putin\u2019s speech before it all kicked off. What he believes is interesting in itself. But to then see what they\u2019ve carried out has been absolutely devastating \u2013 with women, children and journalists being fired upon. It\u2019s madness but then we see world champion boxers like [Vasiliy] Lomachenko and [Oleksandr] Usyk fighting in the Ukrainian army \u2013 with the Klitschko brothers as well. It\u2019s humbling to see Usyk, who has a massive title defence [against Anthony Joshua], and he stopped all his training to go home and fight. Amazing.\u201d\nPlumpton 1.00 Jazz King 1.35 Ballinsker 2.10 Kansas City Chief 2.45 One For Dunstan 3.20 Sainte Doctor (nap) 3.55 Tommy Dillion (nb)\nStratford 1.45 Raffles Gitane 2.20 Interne De Sivola 2.55 Corran Cross 3.30 Osprey Call\n4.05 Envoye Special 4.40 Rambo T\nTaunton 2.00 Highstakesplayer 2.35 Apothicaire 3.10 Some Detail 3.45 Amelia\u2019s Dance 4.20 Majestic Merlin 4.50 Sindabella\nWolverhampton 5.00 Plumette 5.30 Sweet Bertie 6.00 Progressive 6.30 Eternal Summer 7.00 Catbird Seat 7.30 It\u2019s A Love Thing\nDoes he miss the more intellectual side of life he might have had as a history and politics graduate? De Boinville smiles. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised because we have these discussions in the weighing room. There are a lot of highly intelligent jockeys and we bounce ideas off each other. There\u2019s enough to keep you intellectually stimulated.\u201d\nDuring the heat and fervour of Cheltenham there will be little room for historical or political debate. But is De Boinville, the supreme racer, optimistic he will bring home at least two big winners next week in Shishkin and Constitution Hill? \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to use that classic cliche. I\u2019ll take just one. It\u2019s such a competitive environment, and there are so many good horses, jockeys and trainers. It will be a privilege just to ride one winner next week.\u201d\nThe Cheltenham Festival will be live on ITV from Tuesday to Friday. Visit greatbritishracing.com",

        "content": "The lowdown on all new cars, overtaking, tyres, weight, sprint qualifying and three-day weekends in the 2022 F1 season\nStarting from scratch with this year\u2019s models, the sweeping changes in regulations are based on an attempt to shift a significant amount of downforce generation from aerodynamic parts to the floor of the car, through the use of ground effect. The intent is to push the wash of dirty air upwards, away from following cars so they can better close on one another. Intriguingly, the interpretation of the rules has varied across the paddock, not least with Mercedes\u2019s radical sidepod design, already catching attention and potentially protests at its legality. Some will have got it right, but for those who have chosen the wrong path a long season of furious catch-up awaits.\nThe main purpose of these new designs and the exhaustive work Formula One put in over four years into drafting the rules is to improve opportunities for overtaking. If they work, cars should be able to move up to make a pass, avoiding the loss of downforce that turbulent air creates, though their ability to slipstream will also have been diminished. Early signs from testing were that there was cautious optimism from the drivers and some scepticism from engineers but the success or otherwise (do not expect DRS to disappear any time soon) of F1\u2019s efforts will not be truly seen until race day in Bahrain.\nPirelli is bringing in an entirely new tyre this season, switching from the 13-inch wheels used in F1 for more than three decades. This year the cars feature 18-inch wheels, the wider diameter bringing them into line with road cars, and the tyres are larger but with a smaller sidewall. Once more, here the hope is they will flex less, increasing stability and reducing overheating when drivers attempt to overtake. Pirelli expects the degradation rate to fall as well \u2013 potentially reducing many races to one-stops \u2013 while in search of aerodynamic efficiency wheel covers will return for the first time since 2009.\nLap records look to be safe this season, with the new cars set to be the heaviest yet, moving from 752kg to 790kg, a factor of the bigger wheels and new stringent safety standards. The chassis strength requirements have been increased by almost 50%, making them able to absorb higher energy impacts from the front, rear and side. Also included in a swathe of new safety measures, the nose has been made longer after the investigation into Anthoine Hubert\u2019s fatal F2 crash at Spa in 2019, while after Romain Grosjean\u2019s horrific fiery accident at Bahrain in 2020, the power unit must be able to break away from the chassis without rupturing the fuel tank.\nSprint qualifying, trialled last year, returns but has been tweaked for the better. It will be held at three races, in Imola, Austria and Brazil, with qualifying on a Friday still deciding the sprint grid, but now the quickest driver in qualifying will be credited with having taken pole position. The 100km race on the Saturday will then decide the grid for Sunday\u2019s GP but, rather than just last season\u2019s top three, the top eight will be awarded points, from eight to one, with the intent of making it worthwhile for drivers genuinely to make a race of it on the Saturday.\nIf the cancelled Russian race is replaced as planned we will have 23 grands prix, the longest season yet, but as a result the race weekend has been shortened. Practice still takes place on a Friday but the two one-hour sessions will be held in the afternoon, with scrutineering and media work taking place on Friday morning. The aim is to reduce the burden on teams, with the potential of the calendar increasing to 25 races in the next two years, but its efficacy is already being questioned. Many teams say their crews will still have to be at circuits on Thursdays, as will many drivers to carry out sponsor commitments, while Friday is turning into a very long day indeed for engineers and mechanics.",

        "content": "Troy Kotsur could make history at the awards ceremony. He explains how acclaimed film Coda could \u2018help Hollywood have empathy\u2019\nWhen Marlee Matlin won the Oscar for best actress in 1987 for her performance in Children of a Lesser God, it was a landmark moment for deaf people. But it would be another 35 years before Troy Kotsur became only the second deaf person to be nominated for the honour, for his groundbreaking turn in Coda.\nAnd on Sunday he hopes to become the first deaf actor to win a Bafta in one of the main categories.\n\u201cYou had not seen a deaf [Oscar] nominee before Marlee so when she won I was thrilled \u2013 I thought we had a breakthrough as deaf actors,\u201d said Kotsur, 53. \u201cAnd so, 35 years later, I\u2019m realising that deaf actors still really struggle to break in.\u201d\nCoda (an acronym for child of deaf adults) is about a deaf fishing family in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and their hearing teenage daughter\u2019s passion for singing. Featuring deaf actors in key roles \u2013 including Matlin, who plays the wife of Kotsur\u2019s character \u2013 and with much of the dialogue in American Sign Language (ASL), the film is being viewed as a groundbreaking moment for Hollywood and for onscreen representation.\nThe film \u2013 which has already won the top prize at Sundance last year, two Screen Actors Guild awards and is nominated for three Baftas and three Oscars - was adapted by writer-director Sian Heder from the French film La Famille B\u00e9lier.\nBut, unlike that 2014 movie, which was criticised for using hearing actors to play deaf people, Coda casts deaf actors in deaf roles. It was reportedly bought by Apple at Sundance for a record $25m.\nFor Kotsur, after more than 20 years in the industry performing in films, on television and on Broadway, this moment has been a long time in the making. At times he worked multiple jobs and sometimes slept in his car or in theatres. \u201cMy question was: how soon will Hollywood accept me and how can I keep my hope alive?\u201d he said. Part of what kept him going was the success of Matlin, who he describes as his hero.\n\u201cI call it a really, really hellish long tough journey, and it was, but now here I am,\u201d said Kotsur, from Arizona. Now he hopes that together he and Matlin can \u201chelp Hollywood to have some empathy\u201d by changing the way deaf people are seen and portrayed on screen.\nThe film has had an incredible impact on deaf, hard-of-hearing and disabled people, he said: \u201cNow they\u2019re able to really see their identity, their experience being shown on screen.\u201d\nPart of what attracted to him to the film was that it featured multiple deaf characters as opposed to one, which is often the case, and his character\u2019s colourful use of language. \u201cFrank Rossi was able to drop plenty of f-bombs in ASL. So it was a thrill for me to show that part of deaf culture on the big screen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re so used to seeing all of your hearing movies with your swearing and subtitles, but where was our chance to show that part our language and culture?\u201d\nThere has, he said, been a cultural shift and in Hollywood, producers and celebrities are now getting in touch with him \u201crather than me approaching them begging for work\u201d. Actor Javier Bardem told him that he \u201ccried like a baby\u201d watching the film, he said, and stars have spoken to him in sign language.\n\u201cI see Hollywood beginning to be motivated to look for something new, something inspiring and avoid the same old tropes that\u2019s not just \u2018Oh, have pity for a deaf character\u2019, but have them as the hero,\u201d he said. In the future he would like to develop a story about deaf historical figures.\nHe is currently reading several scripts and he is talking to producers about adapting hearing characters into deaf roles. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been setting up meetings on how can this character communicate. How would a deaf character work in these particular situations? And they\u2019re really showing me that a lot of these producers are beginning to open their minds.\u201d\nAs well as Kotsur\u2019s nomination for best supporting actor, Coda is also nominated in two other Bafta categories: adapted screenplay for Heder and leading actress for Emilia Jones, who plays Kotsur\u2019s daughter and will sing at Sunday\u2019s ceremony in London at the Royal Albert Hall.\nKotsur said during filming that the British actress reminded him of his own daughter, who is a coda and a similar age. \u201cShe\u2019s been through a lot and sometimes it\u2019s hard for her to connect with her hearing friends who don\u2019t really understand what it is like to be raised by deaf parents,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our film explains so much and my daughter feels seen and validated.\u201d\nHeder, 44, whose first feature film, Tallulah, starred Elliot Page and Allison Janney, and has written and produced for the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black, said Coda very nearly did not get made. She originally pitched the adaptation to Lionsgate and was hired to do it by the studio.\nBut through her research, she made firm decisions about how she wanted to tell the story. As well as hiring deaf actors, she wanted to have half the dialogue in ASL and use silence, and not fill scenes with music. But it was not a match at the studio and the project died. \u201cIt was heartbreaking on one hand and on the other hand it felt like that other version of the movie should not exist,\u201d she said.\nBut when Lionsgate boss Patrick Wachsberger left the studio, he took the film with him and bought it back made it independently with Heder \u2013 it was shot in 30 days \u2013 and with no distributor.\n\u201cThere has been so much fear among hearing people in Hollywood in terms of the process,\u201d said Heder, who is from Massachusetts and lives in Los Angeles. Early on, when she was told she wanted to hire deaf actors, people kept asking her how it would work \u2013 a question that is not asked about many seemingly impossible feats in the film-making process.\n\u201cIf you say \u2018I want to run this car off the bridge into the river and then I want this building to blow up in the background\u2019, no one says: \u2018Well you can\u2019t do that \u2013 how would it work?\u2019\u201d\nOnce everything was in place, the film-making process was \u201crelatively easy\u201d, she said: \u201cSo that is an argument that doesn\u2019t hold water any more.\u201d\nDeaf charities said the film and the recognition Kotsur has received highlight the importance of deaf people being portrayed on screen and that Kotsur could inspire a generation.\nLikethe deaf actor Rose Ayling-Ellis\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing win, Coda can help transform public understanding of deaf people\u2019s experiences, said Annie Harris, advocacy officer for the Royal National Institute for Deaf People.\n\u201cCoda is a wonderful film and Troy has so evidently been nominated for a Bafta on the merits of his performance,\u201d said Harris. \u201cHis nomination demonstrates to deaf people like me that some barriers are breaking down, and deaf people are getting the recognition they deserve in their chosen field.\u201d Martin McLean, senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children\u2019s Society said that for many young deaf people Coda could be the first time they have seen \u201ctheir reality given the true Hollywood experience\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re finally starting to see more and more deaf characters and it\u2019s important that we build on this momentum.\u201d",

        "content": "Can the New York governor accused of sexual harassment as well as a Covid cover-up succeed in his comeback campaign?\n\nLast summer, the three-term New York governor Andrew Cuomo was considered, in political terms, dead and buried after one of the most spectacular falls from grace in modern US politics.\nA year earlier, he\u2019d been an empathetic pandemic hero, offering New Yorkers a measure of confidence in the state\u2019s response to the early waves of Covid-19 while the US president, Donald Trump, floundered or blustered his way through daily briefings as the terrifying death toll mounted.\nBut then Cuomo was forced to resign from office, leaving wearing a cloak of scandals ranging from allegations of sexual harassment leveled by 11 women, including a member of his protection detail, to a cover-up of the number of elderly people who died in New York nursing homes from Covid-19.\nYet now \u2013 at 64 and out of office \u2013 Cuomo is trying to flip the narrative again and claw back his reputation and maybe, just maybe, his political career. \u201cI\u2019m not disappearing,\u201d he told New York magazine last year and he might just mean it.\nOver the past several weeks, Cuomo has accelerated a campaign of image correction that some believe is a prelude to efforts toward political rehabilitation. With $16m left over in his vacated governorship re-election campaign coffers, he\u2019s got funds to finance the project.\nAt a Brooklyn church last week Cuomo gave his first public speech since leaving office. In an event that looked and felt a lot like old-fashioned retail politicking, Cuomo took aim at those that had brought him down. \u201cThe actions against me were prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d the Bible-quoting Cuomo said in the speech. \u201cThey used cancel culture to effectively overturn an election.\u201d\nThe speech came after the launch of a digital and television advertising campaign that is blaring the same message: Cuomo is the victim, unfairly driven from office.\nIn America\u2019s topsy-turvy politics, where chaos and division seem common currency on both sides of the political divide, even his critics are loth to count him out.\n\u201cThe country elected Donald Trump, so all bets are off,\u201d said Sonia Ossorio, president of New York City\u2019s National Organization for Women. \u201cIt\u2019s the wild, wild west of politics right now across the country. In terms of personal redemption every human being is entitled to seek it.\n\u201cNews coverage focuses on politics as a sport,\u201d Ossorio added \u201cwhich diverts attention from what matters: keeping our government honest.\u201d\nThe question is, does anyone care besides Cuomo, and perhaps his brother Chris who was fired from CNN for his involvement in his elder sibling\u2019s damage control efforts?\n\u201cThe effort you\u2019re seeing is more focused on a public rehabilitation than pursuit of a specific political audience,\u201d said Evan Nierman, a crisis management expert. \u201cThe likelihood that New Yorkers are going to jump back on the Cuomo train after it was derailed in such an explosive fashion is unlikely.\n\u201cAndrew Cuomo is the kind of person who doesn\u2019t like not being in control. He likes directing things, shaping policy and outcomes, not being on the receiving end of that. So he\u2019s looking for opportunities to influence his own future and take back a measure of control.\u201d\nLast month, his attorney, Rita Glavin, repeated proclamations of his innocence and challenged an independent report from the state attorney general\u2019s office that concluded \u201cthe governor sexually harassed a number of state employees through unwelcome and unwanted touching, as well as by making numerous offensive and sexually suggestive comments.\u201d\nThe central theme of Cuomo\u2019s argument is that the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who announced and later dropped out of a run for governor, was politically motivated. Glavin has said she plans to file a misconduct complaint about James to an attorney grievance committee and has claimed James\u2019s office had \u201cdirected an utterly biased investigation\u201d.\nFour district attorneys looked into bringing charges but declined to do so, each stating carefully that their decision was not based on the credibility of his accusers. A fifth, from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, dropped its inquiry.\nIt\u2019s a crack in the door that Cuomo may believe he can lever open by reinterpreting, with help of the campaign war chest, the conclusions of James\u2019s investigation.\nThe former governor has had conspicuous Manhattan meetings with the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams. Before the largely Black congregation in Brooklyn, Cuomo offered a defiant and angry interpretation of his situation.\n\u201cGod isn\u2019t done with me yet,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am blessed, I have many options in life and I am open to all, but on the question if I am at peace, no I am not. But I don\u2019t want to be at peace, and by the way I don\u2019t think you should be at peace either.\u201d\nHis attorney has put it more simply, telling a radio interviewer that Cuomo is \u201cnot going to let this go, because he can\u2019t\u201d.\nBut his efforts provoked a sharp response. \u201cInstead of accepting responsibility, serial sexual harasser Andrew Cuomo continues to challenge the accounts of victims,\u201d read a statement from a group of nine women\u2019s rights and advocacy organizations, including Eleanor\u2019s Legacy, Amplify Her and Women of Color for Progress.\nMembers of the Sexual Harassment Working Group \u2013 an Albany-based group of state government employees who have experienced workplace sexual harassment or assault said Cuomo was \u201cusing taxpayer dollars to fund his victim-shaming campaign after multiple investigations exposed him for what he truly is: a serial sexual harasser who fostered a toxic, hostile work environment\u201d.\nThe response broadly tallies with public opinion polls. A Sienna College poll published last month found that 52% of Democrats said they believed he sexually harassed multiple women, and said they believed James by a margin of 2-to-1 when she concluded he was a serial sexual harasser. Eighty per cent said he\u2019d made the right decision to resign.\n\u201cNew Yorkers are not ready to forgive and forget when it comes to Cuomo,\u201d said Steven Greenberg, a Siena College pollster.\nBut the former governor, who has also spent $1.8m on legal and public relations expenses that include resisting efforts by an ethics commission to claw back more than $5m he received for a book about his handling of the pandemic, remains set on rehabilitation.\nHe told Bloomberg last month that he had not resigned because he did anything wrong \u2013 but because he didn\u2019t want to be a distraction. \u201cI\u2019m still focused on communicating what happened here. Because as a precedent, it has to be exposed.\u201d\nNor would he rule out a future run for office.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to find a way to remind people of what he thinks they should think about him,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic pollster and former political scientist.\nCuomo, he said, was trying to find something that people can feel good about. Against him are voter tendencies against three-term governors and that the accusations against him are \u201cthe very things New Yorkers and Americans have problems with\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to find a way to explain who he was as governor and make it believable before people will give him the opportunity,\u201d Sheinkopf says. \u201cThis is not a guy who dies easily but he\u2019s pretty close to moribund right now.\u201d",

        "content": "The American choreographer on setting classical dance steps to James Blake, his friendship with Nureyev, and why he hugs trees\nOne of the world\u2019s greatest dance-makers, William Forsythe, 72, has redefined classical ballet over a career of more than 40 years. His best known works include In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude and One Flat Thing, reproduced. After a long period in Germany, running his own companies and deconstructing ballet\u2019s fundamental principles, he now divides his time between there and his native US, working as a choreographer for major ballet companies such as Paris Opera Ballet, Boston Ballet and English National Ballet. He lives in Vermont with his wife, the former dancer Dana Caspersen, now a world expert on conflict resolution.\nHow are you doing and where are you doing it?Covid has kept me in Vermont, where I bought a place in the early 90s when my kids were young, after my wife [the dancer Tracy-Kai Maier] died. I thought it would keep them away from drugs and crime! It turned out to be the one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. Never in my adult life have I been in one spot for so long, and I am loving not being on the road the whole time.\nBut you\u2019re on your way to London to stage Blake Works I and Playlist (EP) for English National Ballet?I\u2019m all excited. Outfits! I have been wearing lined sweatpants every day for months.\nBoth works feature classical ballet steps set to pop music \u2013 James Blake and a playlist that includes Peven Everett, Lion Babe and Natalie Cole. What appeals about pop?It underestimates James Blake\u2019s full skill set to call him a songwriter. I call him a composer. His structures are very classically proportioned, which I find true of a lot of pop music. The time signatures and the tempi align themselves with classical ballet formations such as allegro, grand allegro, petit allegro. The music sparks the classical imagination through the liveliness and vitality of its impetus.\nWhen the first parts of Playlist premiered at ENB in 2018, the whole thing was like a party.Historically, the original ballets were fetes, social celebrations, and I wanted to make a celebratory composition.\nYou began training as a classical dancer in your late teens, and before that you were a club dancer. Has that influenced your style?The pop music I grew up with was largely African American. Who isn\u2019t influenced by that? I don\u2019t like rock\u2019n\u2019roll. I love funk. My dancing self was shaped by that music. So, my relationship to ballet is filtered through the influence of African American music.\nDid you dance in clubs?I was a stripper at one point! My very naughty roommate at college said you could make a lot of money, and I was like, OK, how? But that was a brief stint. The narcissist in me loved being admired, and I thought they really liked my dancing. Then the penny dropped.\nHow much are you trying to shift how classical ballet is seen?I\u2019m throwing the glove down to colleagues. I\u2019m an old man, and I\u2019m doing this. You are young people, why are you acting like Jerome Robbins [the great New York City Ballet and Broadway choreographer who created West Side Story]? He\u2019s already been dead for 24 years, let\u2019s move on. I think maybe because I am older, I understand the environment better and I realise that if you do what everyone wants, or what the marketing department thinks is a good idea, it will never work.\nWhy\u2019s that?Marketing departments are based on fear; they are always trying to second-guess, and you can\u2019t do that. You have to ask: why are people in the theatre? With dance, especially classical ballet, it still often does have to do with some celebratory facet. If someone does a triple turn in the air, we all applaud. This guy prevailed over physics and centrifugal force. It says something about the human condition that we are capable of that. Why is bravura pooh-poohed in dance when everyone thinks the Olympics are just fine?\nWhy go back to classical ballet when you had travelled so far from it in your work?It\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really tricky to make. You have to define your relationship to the traditions of craft. I want to make ballet more popular. I want it to be something people look forward to rather than just enduring. Think about all those poor husbands and boyfriends who get schlepped to the ballet, and when they see Playlist, they\u2019re finally going: that was OK!\nWhy do you want to make ballet more approachable?It\u2019s ballet\u2019s politics that are of another era, not the form itself. Ballet is like the alphabet. It\u2019s like saying there is no more writing after Shakespeare. He used letters from the alphabet and words that were made with letters. The alphabet of ballet is eternal \u2013 you just have to use it.\nWhat was your most innovative work? Or has all your work been innovative?Very sweet of you to say! Let\u2019s look at the word innovation: it means renewal in a way. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been innovative, but I\u2019ve been resourceful. I am trying to mine the form, look at different parts of it and say what does this do if I put it in another context.\nIn the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, which you made for the Paris Opera Ballet when Rudolf Nureyev was in charge, remains a defining work. What was it like to work with Nureyev?Oh, wonderful. He was just so supportive and great fun. When I first went to Paris, I ended up in intensive care for a month with a weird tropical disease and nearly died, and he put me up at his apartment with a private servant. It was fabulous. I did my recuperation there, looking at all his art and books and films. He\u2019d ring the butler and tell him to put on a video for me, because I needed to see it. He was really excited about providing me with experiences. I loved him and he loved me too.\nYour life has been full of hurdles. You nearly died, and your second wife, Tracy-Kai, died of cancer at the age of 32. Do you have strategies for coping?Tracy\u2019s death was a big milestone. You learn that there is neither rhyme nor reason to the universe. People die and things happen for inexplicable reasons. I feel a lot of love for other people. It\u2019s a capacity I have. I feel part of something, of the whole scheme of things, I don\u2019t feel like I am in any separate realm of experience.\nI\u2019m the kind of person who will kiss flowers and trees. I\u2019m that kind of goon. I don\u2019t consider that at all odd. That\u2019s how I feel about that tree. It\u2019s 200 years old and it\u2019s a living thing, standing there not running away from me, so I am going to give it a hug and a kiss.\nIf you weren\u2019t a choreographer what would you be?A landscape architect. Such interesting timing involved. Organic timings are on a different scale. I would also have loved to be a florist. I had a scholarship to go to Japan to study with an ikebana master at the end of my teens, but I chose to do a theatre project instead. I still spend time as an amateur ikebanist but you can\u2019t dabble. It\u2019s like being a ballet dancer. It\u2019s a life choice, a worldview.\nEnglish National Ballet\u2019s The Forsythe Evening is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 31 March-10 April",

After that we felt that there was less support from upstairs, after Laporta become president. And that is how it continued until the summer. We went on our summer holidays and I didn\u2019t know whether I would carry on the following season.\n\u201cWe got a decision on that very late. That\u2019s a shame. For me it doesn\u2019t matter too much but to treat Ronald Koeman like that, he did not deserve that. After all the work we had done, the clean out that Ronald had done to make things possible, then I don\u2019t think he deserved not being told [about his future].\u201d\nLarsson, who helped look after the young players coming through, as well as all the forwards, said Messi leaving the club obviously had a big effect on everyone at the club, but that it could have been handled better.\n\u201cYou never thought that Messi would leave the club and it had an effect on the whole squad. It was a tough time but as a coach you have to try to turn off the outside noise and know that you are there to work. There were days when [we] went there and didn\u2019t know whether it was our last or whether we would continue. That could have been easily avoided but that would have demanded much better leadership than what Laporta showed.\u201d\nSeveral young players came through under Koeman, and Larsson is confident the work he and the Dutchman did has given Barcelona something to develop. \u201cThere were a lot of players Koeman and I promoted to the first team, players who will be great for Barcelona in the future. Ronald did a fantastic job in giving young players a chance. He has given Barcelona a good foundation to build on.\u201d",

        "content": "Planning rules to be relaxed so that renewables and nuclear power can boost energy independence after Ukraine invasion\nA massive expansion of wind farms across the UK is now needed for national security reasons, the business secretary has declared, as, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the government considers sweeping changes to planning laws to improve Britain\u2019s energy independence.\nBoris Johnson is planning to unveil a radical new \u201cenergy strategy\u201d within a fortnight to ensure the UK can meet its domestic needs from a mix of renewables and nuclear. The war in Ukraine has brought further huge rises in global fossil fuel prices and exposed countries\u2019 dependence on overseas supplies.\nRemarkably, the need for more on- and offshore windfarms \u2013 traditionally a highly controversial subject in the Conservative party \u2013 is now being talked about within government as a matter of security, rather than a way of fighting climate change.\nRenewables such as wind and solar power are expected to be part of the new government strategy to free Britain from dependence on imported oil and gas and spare households and businesses from the effects of wild fluctuations on global energy markets.\nKwasi Kwarteng, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said last week on Twitter: \u201cThis is no longer about tackling climate change or reaching net-zero targets. Ensuring the UK\u2019s clean energy independence is a matter of national security. Putin can set the price of gas, but he can\u2019t directly control the price of renewables and nuclear we generate in the UK.\u201d\nOfficial figures show that meeting net-zero targets would lead to a drop in gas use of 65% by 2035 in the UK, and almost 100% by 2050.\nWhile some Tory MPs also want the moratorium on fracking for shale gas to be lifted to help reduce dependence on imports, cabinet sources said there was no realistic prospect of doing so in the short term, until the process had been proved to be demonstrably safe. Instead a majority of cabinet ministers back a big push for more renewables and an expansion of nuclear.\nJohnson said last week that all oil imports from Russia would be phased out by the end of this year. In the UK, 4% of gas and 8% of oil currently comes from Russia. The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil.\nSources said changes to planning rules that would make it easier to build windfarms are likely to be announced as part of the new energy strategy. Construction has tailed off since David Cameron tightened regulations when he was prime minister: at the moment local residents can easily block such plans. It is also understood that the government may ease the way for more offshore wind farms, in the teeth of opposition from the fishing industry.\nOther countries are also using security issues raised by the Ukraine crisis to push urgently for more green and clean energy. Germany\u2019s government announced last week an additional \u20ac30bn for its clean energy transition in response to the invasion. Christian Lindner, the finance minister, described renewables as \u201cfreedom energies\u201d that could allow Germany a greater degree of energy independence and transform \u201cthe economy, society and the state\u201d.\nLabour has called for an urgent \u201cnational sprint\u201d to build a clean, green, secure energy future including more renewables. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said last week: \u201cEnergy security is national security. Homegrown, clean power is the cheaper, more secure route to energy security and sovereignty.\u201d\nIn 2020 renewables generated 43 per cent of Britain\u2019s electricity while gas, oil and coal contributed about 40 per cent. The remaining capacity was filled by nuclear.\nIn October last year Johnson announced that all of Britain\u2019s electricity will come from clean energy sources by 2035. The plan now is to bring that date forward.\nWhile many Conservative MPs and party members have opposed windfarms, there are signs of growing support. Kevin Hollinrake, Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton, said: \u201cEngland\u2019s planning system has blocked nearly all new onshore wind developments in the past five years, despite this being the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Reforming these rules, while ensuring communities still get a meaningful say, will spur investment in homegrown clean energy and accelerate our transition away from expensive fossil fuels.\u201d\nSam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, an independent forum for Tories who back decarbonisation, commented: \u201cStreamlining planning approvals and regulations would unleash more wind and solar projects to provide cheap, clean, homegrown power. Now is the time to accelerate the drive towards net zero and away from volatile fossil fuels.\u201d",

        "content": "Security services had concerns about Lebedev, whose father was in KGB, as far back as 2013, say reports\nThe levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has defended the Evening Standard proprietor, Evgeny Lebedev, after fresh questions were raised about the prime minister\u2019s decision to nominate him for a peerage.\nThe Sunday Times reported that the security services had concerns about Lebedev, whose father was a KGB agent, as far back as 2013, with the then head of MI6, John Sawers, refusing to meet him.\nBoris Johnson has been accused of brushing off security concerns, raised by the House of Lords appointments commission, to press ahead with nominating Lebedev as a Tory peer. He had developed a close relationship with Lebedev, attending parties at his Italian castle, including when he was foreign secretary.\nSpeaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Gove appeared to suggest to reopen the question of the peerage would be to play into the hands of Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cI think one of the things that Vladimir Putin would like us to do, is to have an approach in the UK that said that everyone of Russian ancestry was somehow persona non grata,\u201d he said.\nHe added that no one had previously raised concerns with him about Lebedev. \u201cI have met Lord Lebedev, in public, and nobody has ever suggested to me that that was wrong,\u201d Gove said. \u201cHe\u2019s made clear through the pages of the Evening Standard, the newspaper of which he is a proprietor, that he wholeheartedly disapproves of this conflict. He\u2019s been critical of Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions.\u201d\nJohnson rejected the idea he had overruled security concerns to push through Lebedev\u2019s nomination last week, calling it \u201csimply incorrect\u201d.\nHowever, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has written to the House of Lords appointments commission to ask what advice it provided when Johnson sought to nominate Lebedev.\nStarmer wrote: \u201cI understand that the role of the commission has never been to publicise the advice it provides on political nominees but reports of the political views, personal links, and financial interests of Lord Lebedev are deeply troubling.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, Lebedev approvingly tweeted a Daily Mail article asking whether MI6 had some involvement, saying: \u201cWas Litvinenko murdered by MI6?\u2026 Certainly more to it than the generally accepted Putin link.\u201d\nStarmer wrote: \u201cThe accusations made by Lord Lebedev that the British security services had any involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is insulting. I have seen first-hand the real impact of Russian interference in Britain and the difficulties prosecutors encounter when dealing with those who act on behalf of Putin. This is clearly a matter for national security.\u201d\nLebedev robustly defended his record on Friday, saying he was \u201cnot some agent of Russia\u201d, and suggested the fresh scrutiny of his situation amounted to \u201cRussophobia\u201d.\n\u201cBeing Russian does not automatically make one an enemy of the state, and it is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Many of us have imagined being trapped overnight in a supermarket or, even better, a pub. But is it as great as we think? And why is it such a common fantasy?\nNight had fallen, and so had inches of snow. It was 21 December 2009 and Deborah Strazza, managing director of the John Lewis department store in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, had just realised what she had to do. The now 56-year-old made her way to the store\u2019s Tannoy system and broadcast an announcement: could the customers and staff remaining in the building please gather in the restaurant? Outside, the roads were frozen and gridlocked and a supermarket delivery lorry had jack-knifed across the car park, trapping the parked cars within. About 50 customers and 50 members of staff were now snowed in at the department store \u2013 and they were going to have to stay the night.\nIn front of the sports section and underneath the thrum of the yellow ceiling lights, employees set to work pulling sheets on to duvets and fluffing pillows on back-to-back rows of display beds. Someone from the electronics department set up a PlayStation to entertain the children as soft animals made their way over from the toy section into the loving arms of younger kids. Deborah made toast and coffee while a few customers popped to a nearby supermarket for toothbrushes and toothpaste (and a bottle of whisky). It was an idle fantasy made real \u2013 for many of the children, a dream come true. Except the heating was off.\nWho among us hasn\u2019t traipsed the aisles of a big supermarket and fantasised about spending the night? Your survival instincts would leave you with no choice other than to tear open giant bags of crisps. You\u2019d have to pull down games and magazines to pass the time, and it would only be right to sit in a trolley and launch yourself across the squeaky floor. The same is true, of course, of department stores and sweet shops and theme parks\u2026 The question of what it would be like to be trapped in a public space has been answered by various pieces of pop culture (from romcom Career Opportunities in 1991, to an episode of the sitcom Superstore in 2019). But come on, what\u2019s it really, truly, actually like? Is it as good as it seems?\nBizarrely, there were multiple such lock-ins in November and December 2021. On 1 November, 30,000 visitors were held inside Shanghai Disneyland after one guest tested positive for Covid and fireworks lit up the sky as workers in hazmat suits handed out swabs. A month later, customers and staff were snowed inside a Danish Ikea and hunkered down on showroom beds. A week after that, 61 pub-goers spent a long weekend in the Tan Hill Inn in Yorkshire after a snowstorm. Yet Deborah Strazza did it first, more than a decade ago.\n\u201cYour brain naturally, over the years, gets rid of all the bad stuff; you only remember the good stuff,\u201d says Deborah, who lives in St Albans and now runs her own company, Galyna HR. One of her fondest memories is of a little boy who didn\u2019t want to part with the teddy he\u2019d been given the next morning \u2013 she let him take it home. Deborah was also proud to see her staff come together in a crisis. And then there were the two total strangers who\u2019d volunteered to walk to the supermarket for supplies \u2013 they phoned a couple of days later and revealed that they were now boyfriend and girlfriend (yes, they were the ones who bought the whisky). But actually \u2013 on second thoughts \u2013 Deborah can remember a lot of bad stuff, too.\n\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t think it was fun at all, because you were just thinking, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d Deborah says, explaining she was worried about health and safety. Though she lay down on one of the beds, she quickly realised she couldn\u2019t sleep and instead spent the night in the restaurant. The store\u2019s heating had automatically switched off, so the building was freezing. Then news crews arrived at 6am and Deborah balked when a presenter fretted about her makeup. \u201cYou just think, \u2018I\u2019ve been up all night and you\u2019re worried about your lipstick!\u2019\u201d Plus, as cute as wide-eyed babes with teddy bears are, Deborah wanted to get home to her own daughter, who was worried about her mum.\nAlmost 12 years later, Ikea manager Peter Elmose had a parallel experience when heavy snowfall trapped six customers and 25 staff in his store in Aalborg, Demark. He called his regional manager and made the decision to host the impromptu sleepover. But unlike Deborah, Peter didn\u2019t have to shiver in the cold \u2013 workers were already scheduled to work in the warehouse overnight, so overall things were less daunting. Looking back, the 53-year-old says he has no complaints.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s better than fantasy, actually,\u201d Peter says when asked if the experience lived up to our daydreams. \u201cI think we fulfilled the imagination of how it would be to sleep in an Ikea store \u2013 there was no disappointment in that.\u201d Everyone gathered in the staff canteen for cinnamon buns, hot chocolate and coffee, before playing card games, listening to music and watching football on TV. \u201cEverybody went to bed between 11pm and 1am,\u201d Peter says, describing the whole thing as \u201ccosy\u201d with \u201ca good mood and atmosphere\u201d. The night was such a success that co- workers who were safe at home later expressed their jealousy that they had missed out.\nYet Deborah and Peter and their charges were all lucky. The snow cleared overnight and everyone made an early morning escape. Becky Longthorp, one of the customers trapped in the Tan Hill Inn last December, was not so fortunate. For a fateful Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, she slept on the pub\u2019s floor alongside her partner Gary, dog Charlie, and tens of other punters. \u201cOh God, it was cramped,\u201d recalls the 36-year-old east Yorkshire beauty therapist. \u201cWe had Charlie on a tight leash, but he was licking somebody else\u2019s face who was lying next to us in the morning.\u201d\nThe Tan Hill is Britain\u2019s highest pub, and revellers who\u2019d gone to see an Oasis tribute band were trapped in the aftermath of Storm Arwen. After a night spent on the floor using the inn\u2019s spare sheets and blankets, everyone was hungover but \u201cgiddy\u201d. Becky says some customers ordered double Bloody Marys, downing four each by 8.30am. The staff called a meeting in their wedding venue barn and implemented a \u201cno alcohol before lunch\u201d rule.\nNight fell again and it was still too dangerous to leave. Becky and Gary were dressed in winterwear and had a change of clothes because they had originally intended to camp outside the pub so, unlike others in their high heels and stylish jackets, they were able to go for short walks. A routine started: in the mornings, people seemed anxious but, by lunch, the mood improved. In the evenings, people played dominos, drank and took turns on two guitars. \u201cWe just embraced it,\u201d she says. But as the days wore on, the novelty wore off.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being at a party and then you\u2019re stuck at the party,\u201d Becky explains. \u201cYou have no space. We couldn\u2019t get any privacy. The panic, I suppose, came on Sunday.\u201d In four days, Becky managed to have just one shower \u2013 and convinced her boyfriend to give her his spare pants. Both frequently struggled to sleep as revellers drank until 4am. But by far the worse bit was the cost \u2013 combined, Becky and Gary spent \u00a3700.\n\u201cThey did a buffet one night and they did discount the food, but we still spent so much. On night one, I spent more than \u00a3100 because we got there at 4pm. We had dinner, we had loads of drinks. And the menu isn\u2019t cheap,\u201d Becky explains. Three more days of alcohol, soft drinks, regular meals and snacks added up \u2013 when the fresh food started to deplete, staff began serving freezer foods, such as scampi and chips. Seeing \u201cTan Hill Inn\u201d over and over on her bank statements still makes Becky want to cry, but overall she\u2019s happy she had the once-in-a-lifetime experience. \u201cI think it depends on who you are as a person,\u201d she says. \u201cOur personalities suited it.\u201d\nBy his own admission, Dan Davis did not suit getting locked inside a Kmart supermarket one Sunday last August. Dan \u2013 a 29-year-old who reviews tech on his YouTube channel DansTube.TV \u2013 was trapped in the Brisbane store after closing. He\u2019d forgotten it was Sunday and had arrived just after the closing announcements. Dan was picking up candles and pyjamas for his girlfriend when suddenly it went dark. \u201cI put my phone light on and turned the corner and saw the gates were down,\u201d he says. \u201cI started to panic and began shouting out to anyone in the store.\u201d No one was there.\nDan began jogging through the shop and met a security guard on the other side of the gates. \u201cHe didn\u2019t reassure me. That was kind of terrifying,\u201d Dan says, explaining the man said he\u2019d be clocking off soon. When Dan later shared the story of his ordeal on social media, people said he should have ridden a bike down the aisles. But, says Dan, \u201cI really didn\u2019t even have any moment of, \u2018What can I do? What can I check out?\u2019 I just wanted to get out.\u201d The creaking and clicking air conditioning unit started to make him feel he was in a horror film. Eventually, motion sensors alerted the manager of his presence and she returned to let Dan out. His imprisonment had lasted just 40 minutes.\nIn reality, it seems, being locked somewhere isn\u2019t an invitation to do whatever you like and mobile phones mean that \u201cSorry, I ate the entire biscuit aisle to survive\u201d no longer cuts it as an excuse. Yet Erin Westgate, a psychology professor at the University of Florida who studies boredom and daydreams, says we continue to have lock-in fantasies because it\u2019s fundamentally escapist to imagine \u201cexperiencing familiar environments in unfamiliar ways\u201d.\n\u201cWe tend to daydream about the things we already do in everyday life,\u201d Westgate explains. \u201cOne study found that about 54% of daydreams were linked to something about the environment people were in at the time.\u201d But research into \u201caffective forecasting\u201d has found that nothing is quite as good as we expect, while \u201cconstrual level theory\u201d posits that we think of distant things in theoretical ways. \u201cWhen we imagine events in the far-off future (or the imaginary future, in the case of daydreaming) we tend to focus on abstract high-level aspects of the experience \u2013 for example, \u2018It would be so freeing!\u2019 \u2013 and neglect the concrete details \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s very cold in this supermarket and I don\u2019t have a coat\u2019,\u201d Westgate says.\nStill, our fantasies aren\u2019t going anywhere, and businesses now play into them, selling sleepovers in museums and aquariums. On social media, faked \u201ctrapped in a supermarket for 24 hours!\u201d videos rack up millions of views. But for those who\u2019ve made fantasy a reality, once was enough. \u201cWe had a lot of people the following year saying, \u2018Are you going to do a sleepover?\u2019\u201d Deborah says, \u201cand I was thinking, \u2018You have no idea! We are never going to do this again!\u2019\u201d",

The supplies were to be boxed and flown to the border between Ukraine and Poland and distributed by volunteers. He said he hadn\u2019t slept for two days.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super cold, so imagine fighting in those conditions,\u201d Alex Dubov, a professor at Loma Linda University, who has family in Ukraine, said outside the church. \u201cThe boots that Jon was just bringing in is like, sent by heaven.\u201d\nBarton is not sending weapons or ammo \u2013 by law, he can\u2019t \u2013 but this is crucial gear civilians often forget, he said. Many are everyday Ukrainians suddenly facing relentless shelling.\nHe\u2019s donating about 80% of his inventory, including about 620 uniforms of various camouflage colors, 118 boots of different vintage and 300 pairs of gloves.\n\u201cSometimes we forget the details \u2013 the slings, the canteens, the belts, the shoelaces. All that\u2019s important,\u201d Barton said.\nThe idea emerged after a friend asked if he had extra camouflage uniforms. Barton had already been stirred by an image of young Ukrainian men, clad in knee pads to fight Russian troops, and videos of Russians firing at the press.\n\u201cI said hold on, not just that, could you guys use knee pads? Could you guys use belts?\u201d he said. \u201cI have tactical gear, and I have it by the bucket-full.\u201d\nBarton was soon heading to Ventura county, where his company houses its inventory of gear from military base stores and third-party contractors, including phased-out colors and equipment for each branch of the military.\n\u201cMy neighbors kept coming by like, \u2018Are you planning for war?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m giving it to Ukraine.\u2019 They flipped out,\u201d Barton said.\nBarton has made a living advising Hollywood since he first worked as a set extra and realized the uniforms weren\u2019t authentic. He\u2019s worked with actors including Aaron Eckhart and Chris Hemsworth, and his credits include NCIS and Criminal Minds.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a character using weapons \u2026 you want them to have adequate training, and the really important thing that Jon brings to table is that he understands it\u2019s not the military \u2013 these actors are playing a role and you can\u2019t treat each one the same way,\u201d said producer Gale Anne Hurd, who first met Barton on the set of Punisher: War Zone.\nIt\u2019s not about putting a gun in someone\u2019s hand, he said \u2013 it\u2019s about authentically bridging fantasy and reality.\n\u201cYou could tune in Friday night at 9pm and watch JAG, but it didn\u2019t look like CBS News at 7. What fantasy world are you living in?\u201d he said.\nNow, fantasy and reality are colliding again, and the threat of world war, or nuclear fallout, usually reserved for the big screen, feels close to home, he said.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t get too scared about this, but the marine in me used to sit through classified briefings and seeing satellite imagery,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s a part of him, too, that wishes he were there.\n\u201cMy kneejerk reaction is always, let\u2019s go in there, kick some ass,\u201d Barton said. \u201cAnd then I think about it and [realize], we can\u2019t do that because this and this, and then the politics come into play and I totally get that.\u201d\nHe also knows his involvement isn\u2019t without professional risk. Barton has noticed some clients aren\u2019t returning his phone calls.\n\u201cI\u2019m less desirable to be hired on to a show where they try to take an apolitical stance, even though I\u2019m not doing anything political,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help humans.\u201d\nStill, Barton hopes larger film studios will follow his lead and donate their fleet of gear.\n\u201cSome of these prop companies have acres and acres of equipment, especially just uniforms and boots, something that we wouldn\u2019t even bat an eye at in the film industry,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just costumes.\u201d\nThey say costumes, he said. \u201cI say uniforms.\u201d",

        "content": "It has been two years since the US declared a national emergency because of Covid \u2013 these graphics show the costs and cautious hopes for the future\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has hit the United States hard, sparing no region, race or ethnicity, though some groups have suffered more than others.\nThe virus has caused more than 965,000 US deaths; strained healthcare systems; changed companies and employees\u2019 expectations of one another; and sparked political battles over vaccine mandates and controls.\nAs we reach the second anniversary of the pandemic being declared a national emergency in the US, infectious disease experts suggest \u2013 with caveats \u2013 that the worst could be over and that we could soon see something like life before Covid-19, at least in terms of gathering with others indoors.\nWe\u2019ve had multiple false dawns that the worst is over and now hopes are growing again, with controls easing, but experts have cautioned we must remain vigilant for new variants and prepare for an endemic phase of the disease.\nDuring the first half of 2021, people regained a sense of hope after an extraordinary year filled with death, job loss and isolation from family and friends. Vaccines became widely available; the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations decreased; and the weather warmed, which allowed people to more easily gather and worry less about contracting the virus.\nThen that summer, the Delta variant, which was twice as contagious as previous variants, arrived in the US, causing a new wave of infections and worries. During the peak of the third wave of the pandemic in winter 2020-21, there was a seven-day average of more than 130,000 hospitalizations. At the height of the Delta wave, that number was 100,000.\nOnce that wave ebbed, talk of a return to normal again emerged, only to be interrupted by another even more contagious variant \u2013 Omicron \u2013 though the symptoms from this one were less severe, particularly for people who were vaccinated against the virus. That wave caused the highest number of hospitalizations throughout the entire pandemic, at one point leading to a seven-day average of almost 160,000 hospitalizations.\n\u201cThere were two occasions, just before Delta and just before Omicron, where as a society and public health community, we thought we were on the verge of some variation of success,\u201d said William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\nNow that the number of Omicron cases and hospitalizations have plummeted, elected officials and business leaders again feel confident in their reading of the waves \u2013 but Schaffner does not necessarily share their assessment.\nThat\u2019s in part because even if we declare Covid to be endemic in the United States, meaning that it\u2019s a regular part of life here and more manageable, rather than a pandemic, meaning an ongoing global outbreak, a new variant could crop up in a different part of the world that evades existing vaccines.\n\u201cWe would have to create new vaccines and start vaccinating all over again, which would have all the impact of the proverbial lead balloon,\u201d said Schaffner. \u201cWe are a very large and diverse country\u201d so the end of the pandemic \u201cwon\u2019t happen simultaneously \u2026 but maybe by the end of March and the beginning of April, we can be there over most of the country\u201d.\nThe US is a large and diverse country. Its rifts and inequities were laid bare and worsened by the virus.\nDemocratic governors instituted stricter lockdown measures than their Republican counterparts. Red states had significantly lower rates of vaccination against Covid than blue states. People of lower income were less likely to get vaccinated.\nBlack Americans were significantly more likely to die of Covid, even though the Black population is younger than the nationwide average.\n\u201cYou name the illness, whether it\u2019s a communicable disease or it\u2019s diabetes,\u201d minority populations \u201care disadvantaged in terms of the impact of disease\u201d, said Schaffner. \u201cThis has been true of the impact of Covid.\u201d\nWhile Black people were less likely than white and Hispanic people to get vaccinated, they overcame their vaccine hesitancy more quickly than white people, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\u201cWhen the vaccines were touted as having been created at \u2018warp speed\u2019, well, we in science were very proud of that, but the way that was heard by a lot of people was, \u2018Ooo, they probably cut corners,\u2019\u201d Schaffner said. But \u201cvaccine acceptance has really grown in the Black community because at the local level, health departments and others have really worked hard to reach out, provide information and have people of color go out and be the messengers\u201d.\nMore than 965,000 people have died from Covid during the pandemic. Such a toll is equivalent to the 15th most populous city in the country, more than San Francisco, Washington DC or Boston.\nBut Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, suspects that is an undercount.\nThere have been more than 1 million excess deaths from Covid and other health issues in the US during the pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nLessler attributes the difference between the official Covid death tally and the CDC excess death count to Covid \u201cdeaths that did not get attributed to Sars-CoV-2, but that being said, I think detailed analysis will be needed before we can say that with 100% certainty\u201d.\nWhatever the actual number is, it could have been significantly lower had more people decided to get vaccinated against the virus, Lessler said. \u201cI think it\u2019s played a big role because being vaccinated decreases your mortality so much, and a pretty high percentage of deaths have been among the unvaccinated,\u201d he said.\nEven though many Black people have managed to overcome their vaccine hesitancy, it\u2019s unlikely that many more unvaccinated people in that demographic and others will opt to get the shots, said Schaffner. Over the last two months, the percentage of people who have been fully vaccinated has only increased by about three percentage points, from 61% of the US population to 64%.\nSchaffner is also discouraged by the fact that only 43% of the people in the US who were fully vaccinated have received a booster dose, according to CDC data.\n\u201cThere has been an avalanche of new stories \u2026 that says boosters are good things, and they haven\u2019t taken advantage of it, so I think we have pretty much reached a maximum, and if going forward, an annual booster may be required, that will be a hard sell,\u201d said Schaffner. \u201cWe don\u2019t do terribly well with our influenza vaccine campaigns \u2013 we do OK but not great \u2013 and I think we would have a hard time telling people to roll up both sleeves.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that there was a time when Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms were not a part of daily life for white-collar workers in the United States. But when the pandemic forced business leaders to temporarily \u2013 or permanently \u2013 close their buildings, the world changed.\nBy April 2020, 22m jobs in the United States were lost, and employment numbers still haven\u2019t returned to their pre-pandemic levels.\n\u201cIt was not just an unemployment increase, but also a lot of people left the labor force,\u201d said Iwan Barankay, an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.\nUS labor force participation in January was also only about 62%, which remained more than a percentage point less than before the pandemic, said Barankay. It had dipped as low as 60%.\nIn part because of school closures, \u201clots of women left the labor force, and now we are starting to see a trickle back into the labor force,\u201d said Barankay.\nSome industries, however, still have far fewer jobs, particularly those that necessitate people working in person, such as mining and logging, leisure and hospitality and education and health services.\nA major story during the pandemic has been the global supply crisis, which has been attributed to the various shocks that the world\u2019s economies have undergone since the outbreak.\nOff the coast of Los Angeles a record-breaking flotilla of container ships has been waiting to unload goods. The US has also experienced a giant labor shortage, especially in the leisure and entertainment sector; and there were a record 10m job openings in the country at the end of June.\nChanges to the way we shop have been exacerbated by the crisis with a rise in \u201cone-click ordering\u201d being served by an expansion of warehousing by multiple firms including Amazon, which has had environmental costs for some communities.\nWorkers\u2019 expectations of their employers also changed significantly during the pandemic. \u201cHow companies coped during the pandemic and their ability to transition back depended on the extent their work can be done from home,\u201d said the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Barankay.\nAs workers slowly return to offices, will work life snap back to how it was in 2019?\nCristina Banks, director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces at the University of California, Berkeley, said the forced changes of the crisis have opened up possibilities.\n\u201cSome people are starting to think about how could we design work that will really benefit people and businesses,\u201d Banks said.\n\u201cThere are no answers yet, but I think instead of following blindly a leader\u201d in an industry, \u201csome people are engaging in conversations\u201d and saying: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have people working worldwide and all different hours?\u201d",

        "content": "We remember the murdered bakers, the postal workers, the animal shelter volunteers and we say: there will be justice\nBefore, my wife and I hardly ever ate bread. At least, if we weren\u2019t in the village where we sometimes spend weekends away from our home in Kyiv. The bread we bought in the village was always tastier than the city stuff. In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow\u2019s milk was also given to little kids and they loved it.\nSince arriving in western Ukraine, where like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before.\nOur boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf \u2013 a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery which is 20km from our village. Occasionally, you could find this bread in Kyiv, but only in small corner shops, not supermarkets.\nI have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight.\nThe fact is Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack. In an instant, 13 bakery staff were killed and nine were injured. And the bakery is no more \u2013 \u201cMakariv bread\u201d is a thing of the past.\nI have long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Putin to Ukrainian soil. Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat. Even in Egypt, bread and cakes are baked using Ukrainian flour. It\u2019s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done. The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal \u2013 fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters. And it\u2019s all covered in blood. The blood of Russian soldiers who do not understand what they are fighting for, and the blood of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians who know that if they do not fight, Ukraine will no longer exist. In its place there will be a cemetery with a caretaker\u2019s hut and some kind of governor general sent from Russia will sit and guard it.\nBread was mixed with blood in Chernihiv as well when Russian bombers dropped \u201cdumb\u201d unguided bombs on a square next to a bread shop. People had lined up outside, waiting to buy some fresh, warm bread. Someone was just leaving the store with a bag of it. Many people died in this bombing raid. Amnesty International has documented this crime committed by the Russian army. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin\u2019s actions are added to it \u2013 the shooting of young volunteers who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of postmen who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an attack on the Kyiv television tower. The list goes on and on. We certainly don\u2019t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn\u2019t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged.\nInternational lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army. They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms \u2013 the latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that in case of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows.\nThe people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world. The metro is no longer a form of transport \u2013 it is a haven, like something from an apocalyptic movie. It is covered with signs of permanent presence of non-travelling \u201cpassengers\u201d and there is living space everywhere. The station platforms are being turned into cinemas where films are shown for free \u2013 children\u2019s films in the morning and films for a wider audience later in the day. Large screens have already been hung or are being hung right now at 14 Kyiv metro stations. There is a constant supply of tea, the internet is already there, but the connection is poor. There are not enough toilets, but people don\u2019t complain about queuing for 40 minutes or more. Everyone waits patiently. They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial \u2013 a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg.\nAnd, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don\u2019t think about it at all. They are now busy buying dollars and euros. Sanctions targeting the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic. Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now trying to leave their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin.\nSome captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good. \u201cJail awaits us if we return!\u201d they say.\nOn the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It\u2019s said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports. These are those who don\u2019t want to fight either. I won\u2019t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other. Mobilisation has been announced, but no one is forcibly taken into the army. Those who themselves want to defend their homeland come to the military registration and enlistment offices and get registered. Most often, they are asked to leave a phone number and to wait for a call. There are many who want to fight the invaders, but not all of those who want to fight are really ready to participate in military action.\nIn the last couple of days, I\u2019ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the news feed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears.\nBut I can\u2019t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country. I know that in the occupied Melitopol, in the south of Ukraine, arrests of Crimean Tatar activists and other active citizens have begun. I know that the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been kept inside the station by the Russian invaders, that their mobile phones were taken away and that they have not been allowed to leave the station for more than a week now. Moscow television propagandists have gone there under the protection of the Russian military to make news stories. I don\u2019t know what they are saying in Russia about this war, about the captured Chernobyl nuclear power plant, about the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is still in operation. Why do they need this non-military atomic installation? Are they planning to blackmail Ukraine and the world? Why are they bombing children\u2019s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don\u2019t have answers to these questions.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t understand Russia with your mind!\u201d wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev.\nI agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?\nAndrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and author of Death and the Penguin",

        "content": "Royal Exchange, Manchester; Almeida; Menier Chocolate Factory, LondonStef Smith\u2019s Ibsen update can\u2019t quite match the original for its sense of dread; the mystery play gets a Covid-era reboot; and Maria Friedman wallows in showtune nostalgia\n\nStef Smith\u2019s Nora: A Doll\u2019s House, a response to Ibsen\u2019s classic, had its nicely timed opening at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange on International Women\u2019s Day. Ibsen used to deny he had intended to write a feminist play but nothing trumps A Doll\u2019s House (1879) in its scrutiny of a woman trapped within an oppressive marriage. Smith\u2019s ingenious play, first performed in 2019, imagines three Noras, each inhabiting a different moment in time. The Nora of 1918 is gracefully got up in a long cream coat with a fur collar and is played with decorous charm by Kirsty Rider. The Nora of 1968 wears an unbecoming, shorter blue coat and is strikingly played by Jodie McNee who shows what it is to feel physically trapped, coiling in on herself like a stowaway within her own body. The Nora of 2018 is played with unhappy glamour by Yusra Warsama in a flowingly loose turquoise wrap but is as trapped as her predecessors in this eternal (we pray not too eternal) triangle.\nAmanda Stoodley\u2019s set looks like a bistro, with occasional tables covered in lace cloths, and brittle wooden chairs. It begins with the Noras encircling the stage in a wintry rush, burdened with Christmas shopping. The modern Nora has grabbed a tiny, cut-price Christmas tree to take home. Smith skilfully portions out speech between them, their narrative is shared. For each woman, money is an issue and Smith contributes to Ibsen\u2019s understanding of how Norah\u2019s lack of economic independence is partly responsible for the instability of her marriage. She is good, too, on secrets and the difficulty women sometimes face in telling each other how they actually feel. And she has a fine sense of detail. She describes, in the household of each Nora, the pervasive scent of lavender and its bid for calm.\nA single actor plays Thomas, the husband. William Ash rises \u2013 or sinks \u2013 excellently to the challenge. He is disagreeably plausible no matter the century in which he finds himself. Like many a tyrant, he believes himself kind but is tiresomely condescending and with a short fuse. Daniel, Nora\u2019s old flame, about to be extinguished forever, is played with intensity by Naeem Hayat and Andrew Sheridan is superb as blackmailing Nathan \u2013 a pale, hunted fellow who reminds us that predators sometimes double as prey. But for all its elegant intelligence, the contrivance of the play makes it impossible to adhere to any moment in time \u2013 context barely exists. Director Bryony Shanahan does her best to compensate with movement \u2013 as if, with so much going on, there is no need to settle in any place or time. At one point, the Noras dance like crazed fish on hooks to distract Thomas from reading the letter that might prove their doom (or salvation). But the play remains more a diagram than a furnished painting and while it is not fair to penalise Smith for not being Ibsen, one can see A Doll\u2019s House any number of times and continue to feel the mounting foreboding Ibsen orchestrated. Here, there is strain from the start but no incremental building of tension. Foreboding is replaced by the empty peril of the foregone conclusion. You know what the outcome will be and the doll\u2019s house becomes a waiting room.\nThere is no such predictability to The Key Workers Cycle, a north London community-based project at the Almeida. These animated, heartwarming new pieces, envisaged as modern-day mystery plays, were commissioned during the pandemic and honour the unhonoured who kept \u2013 and keep \u2013 things going: teachers, rubbish collectors, midwives and so on. In one sense, it feels peculiar to be focusing on lockdowns precisely at the moment that coronavirus is being horrifyingly upstaged in our minds by the war in Ukraine. But might it be possible cautiously to celebrate the sense that, even though coronavirus is, alas, far from a thing of the past, the world these plays describe feels bizarrely close to being dated?\nI saw the cycle\u2019s first tranche of three (there are nine plays all together). The first is Assembly: The Teachers\u2019 Play, written by Sonali Bhattacharyya, a fresh, exuberant reminder of the chaos the pandemic caused in schools, splendidly directed by Kate Golledge. Josh Elliott\u2019s The Full Works: The Funeral Directors\u2019 Play is a fantastically weird, funny, macabre piece, tremendously acted by Chima Akpa, Jason Barnett and Bill Milner. It involves a personable corpse who lets us into his thoughts as he receives a close shave in the funeral parlour. There is wonderful direction by Emily Ling Williams. In Face the Music: The Social Care Workers\u2019 Play, an astonishing lineup of older actors (from the company Well-Versed, part of the community arts organisation All Change) brings the house down \u2013 the oldest actor, the phenomenal Eula Harrison, is 96. They are moving, courageous and memorable \u2013 emphasising the importance of kindness, dreaming, dancing and the mutual care that helps us survive. Towards the end, Daphne Chamberlain tells us charmingly how she thinks of the ocean to cheer herself up and asserts that whenever she brings it vividly to mind, it is every bit as real as north London\u2019s Balls Pond Road.\nThere is a moment in Maria Friedman\u2019s Legacy, a showcasing of musical numbers in celebration of Stephen Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand, when she kicks off her high silver heels and leaves them by the piano. \u201cThey\u2019re going off and they\u2019re staying off,\u201d she declares, like a Cinderella in reverse. \u201cYou\u2019re in my home now,\u201d she adds. But being a reverse Cinderella is risky \u2013 even when you are as charming as Friedman. Congratulating yourself on having been repeatedly invited to the ball does nothing to safeguard the present. Sondheim was a master of nostalgia, but this self-serving nostalgia-fest is too cosy by half. Friedman performs Broadway Baby, within the context of a decades-old triumph in which she wowed Sondheim himself. She tells us she learned to go \u201cinto the lyric\u201d as a safe place to be. And while we can revel with her in the music\u2019s slow stealth, the lyrics now seem neither here nor there.\nThe show is saved by the young talent she has recruited. Friedman\u2019s son, Alfie, performs Sondheim\u2019s Franklin Shepard, Inc with adrenalised brilliance and Desdemona Cathabel, an Indonesian student at the Royal Academy, sings The Miller\u2019s Son beautifully.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nLori Petty lives with her cat in a gloriously cluttered apartment in Venice Beach, a neighbourhood in southern California that she moved to three decades ago while filming the surfer movie Point Break. A row of high arched windows let in plenty of light, and just about every other spare inch of the 58-year-old\u2019s wall space is given over to portraits, photographs, hung up hats and books. Somehow, Petty has found a patch of bare whiteness that\u2019s big enough for her to sit in front of for our Zoom call. This took a bit of stagecraft, she admits. \u201cYa ready?\u201d Petty whips away the white background to reveal the reflective glare of an LCD screen. \u201cIt\u2019s my TV! I put a quilt over it!\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.\u00a0Learn more.\nShe has a gleeful, infectious cackle; she has close cropped grey hair, occasionally dyed platinum or purple, and conspicuous sleeve tats. But it\u2019s Petty\u2019s unique way of talking that catches your attention at the outset. Both squeaky and hoarse, part Smoky Mountain preacher, part chill Cali baller, her voice puts you in mind of all the eclectic screen work past and present, whether that\u2019s the family film A League of Their Own (1992) or the gen X classic Tank Girl (1995), the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black (2013-2019) or her superb new TV show that debuted this winter on HBO and (in the UK) Starzplay: the apocalypse drama Station Eleven. About 18 months ago, while enduring \u201cthe severe, crippling loneliness\u201d of someone who lived alone through the pandemic, Petty auditioned for Station Eleven just like this: squatting in front of her telly, quilt as backdrop, lighting courtesy of the Pacific sun.\nBased on an acclaimed 2014 novel by Emily St John Mandel, Station Eleven tells the story of a group of survivors living around Lake Michigan in the months and years after a flu-like pandemic has killed all but one in 1,000 of the world\u2019s population. The show was in production (and partially filmed) before Covid struck. Everybody who worked on it through 2020 and 2021 had to contend with the eerie feeling of art and life being utterly blurred. Petty filmed her scenes in Canada, \u201cwhere we were in lockdown my entire 140 days in the country. There was no furniture in the hotel lobby. There were no restaurants. There were no bars.\u201d She folds her tattooed arms and adds, with a grin: \u201cY\u2019know what? In my experience? When you go on location to shoot? You have a good time. You have sex. Not on this one! This was not hanging out with the crew. This was not buying cute shit in the nearest city. This was staying in your bubble. There was literally a plastic bubble inside the car that took you between the hotel and the set.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in finding Station Eleven (its penultimate episode launches on Starzplay today) the smartest, most relevant TV show of the decade so far. It doesn\u2019t only grapple with questions of how to carry on when times are hard. Instead it asks, why carry on at all? Station Eleven\u2019s show-runner, Patrick Somerville, drawing from Mandel\u2019s bestseller, introduces us to a made-over America populated by scavengers and terrifying nihilists, but also by actors, musicians, museum curators, horticulturalists, gourmands. We meet a community of pregnant ravers who care for each other in an abandoned furniture shop. We meet an eccentric, shaven-headed musician called Sarah, played by Petty, who endlessly composes impossibly ambitious symphonies on a salvaged piano.\n\u201cThose piano lessons!\u201d says Petty, remembering a gruelling schedule of Zoom-based lessons that she undertook from quarantine. \u201cCan you imagine? I had my computer on a laundry basket. I had my electronic keyboard on my lap. I had a nice man called Gregory who kept asking to see what I was doing with my hands.\u201d For one scene it was scripted that Petty would play a piano solo, at night, outdoors. \u201cTwo in the morning and it starts pouring with rain. I was, like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna shoot this. I am not gonna have been sitting in that room doing 140 days of piano lessons not to shoot this!\u2019 And I played the Jesus out of that song.\u201d\nI\u2019m only a few minutes into my conversation with Petty and already it\u2019s clear why she and this particular show have gelled so well. Station Eleven insists on the primacy of art, of humour, of joy \u2013 however shitty things get. Petty\u2019s fascinating life has been faced in much the same way. \u201cWe choose how we react to any given day,\u201d she says. \u201cI might wake up, I\u2019m gonna take a walk on the beach, I\u2019m gonna be happy. Or I\u2019m gonna stay in bed and read a book and feel sorry for myself. You make these choices!\u201d In Station Eleven, she says, \u201clife has given these people mouldy lemons. They choose to go forward anyway. They choose life.\u201d\nPetty got a few mouldy lemons herself at the start. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d she says, \u201cI had a colourful background.\u201d Her first years were spent in a trailer park in Tennessee. By the time she was a teenager she lived with her single mother, Mary, and two younger sisters in desperate-sounding conditions in Illinois. Decades later she dramatised this period of her life in a film she co-wrote called The Poker House. Abusive father. Mother, addicted to alcohol and drugs, who was coerced by a new partner into prostitution. Pimps in the house. Petty\u2019s black-as-ink sense of humour must run in her family, though, because when she showed her mother a final cut of the film, Mary complained: \u201cBut I never smoked in front of you!\u201d\nThe Petty women are still very close. In fact, Mary calls during our interview, right as Petty is talking about how she used to withdraw from the chaos at home and hide out on a local basketball court. They talk about a sore tooth that Petty has been visiting dentists about. They say they love each other several times and when Petty hangs up she shrugs: \u201cYou always have to answer when your mom calls, right?\u201d How did she get through those difficult early years and retain a relationship, I ask, and she quotes the movie Fight Club. \u201cYou are not your fucking khakis.\u201d I don\u2019t quite understand this, until Petty explains: \u201cYou are not what happens to you.\u201d\nShe was still a teenager, she recalls, when she climbed on a bus \u201cand moved to New York. I lived at the YMCA. I don\u2019t remember being afraid.\u201d She got her first headshot (denim jacket, cropped dark hair) and while still technically homeless she auditioned for TV shows. Small roles on Twilight Zone, The Equalizer and Miami Vice followed in the mid-1980s. She tells me a story about her breakthrough job on a 1989 TV show called Booker, \u201ca very silly show that was a spin-off of 21 Jump Street\u201d. Its male stars were Richard Grieco and Johnny Depp. \u201cBoth were huge deals at the time. Like the Beatles, mobs of girls chasing them down the street.\u201d\nPetty was 21. She remembers it dawning on her that celebrity behaviour seemed to invite celebrity trouble. This epiphany informed the early years of a movie career that followed. \u201cI was never gonna be the movie star in a room who\u2019s the last one out to set. I was never the one saying, \u2018I won\u2019t wear red cos she\u2019s wearing red.\u2019 I\u2019m not that person. Others treat you how you behave. We each set our own tone.\u201d She remembers early movies for the giggles that were generated on set, for the silliness and the luxuries behind the scenes, for \u201cthe limos\u2026 the penthouse suites with columns inside them \u2013 real columns! \u2013 the billowing curtains\u201d.\nSlathered in fake tan to play a surfer in 1991\u2019s Point Break, Petty was in the middle of a screen kiss with Keanu Reeves when she hooked her fingers in her co-star\u2019s belt, trying to catch Reeves off guard by prolonging the snog. (She did \u2013 you can see his astonishment in the final cut of Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s movie.) A year later she was shooting Penny Marshall\u2019s baseball movie A League of Their Own, holding her own in an ensemble of stars including Tom Hanks and Madonna. Petty shared a makeup trailer with Madge. Curious, one day, she asked: \u201cDid you always know you were gonna be Madonna?\u201d To which Madonna replied no. But she did pray to be.\nPetty\u2019s own prospects were not as clearly mapped out. When she made Free Willy in 1993, another cheerful family film, another hit, she figured she was carving out a niche for herself. \u201cY\u2019know, cool, this is my job now.\u201d Almost as soon as that thought had struck, work dried up for months. \u201cIt was just, like, blam,\u201d she says, slamming her hands down on the table in front of her. It\u2019s not quite clear what changed, but Petty has always credited the employment dip to the fact that she didn\u2019t have the right appearance for the era: too pale, too androgynous, not a Rachel from Friends, not a Winona. \u201cI always used to tell [casting directors], \u2018If you want the girl next door, go next door, that\u2019s where she lives, cos I\u2019m not her.\u2019 So it\u2019s kind of my fault.\u201d\nWhen the lead pulled out of Rachel Talalay\u2019s 1995 adaptation of the comic book Tank Girl, Petty was offered the role. This high-profile movie lost a lot of money on its cinematic release, though became a cult hit on home video and DVD. It continues to inspire generations of cosplayers and to this day Petty earns pocket money from appearances at comic conventions. On the occasion of Tank Girl\u2019s 25th anniversary, during the 2020 pandemic, Petty and her director reunited for a tweet-a-long viewing of the movie. Career-wise, those 25 years had been seriously mixed ones for Petty.\nAt the turn of the millennium there were guest spots on Star Trek and ER. She had a profitable run voicing a baddie in Superman cartoons. By 2005, she was way down the credits in a movie called The Karate Dog. Shortly afterwards, her ex-partner, the actor and comic David Alan Grier, suggested they write a screenplay together. This led to The Poker House, which Petty decided told a story so close to home she should direct it herself \u2013 the project wasn\u2019t only influenced by her childhood, but also by her experiences as a woman in showbusiness.\nPetty explains. She came up in an especially bad time for actresses, when screen representation for women was at a low ebb and when the average studio flick (at least by her own anecdotal calculations) might feature 60 actors, of whom three or four would be female. \u201cThe lead girl, her friend, the mean boss, and that [was] about it.\u201d Things were way worse behind the scenes. As a young woman she showed up at an audition, already instructed to wear a certain type of dress, only to \u201chave to walk around a table of men\u201d. She can see things have improved a little now. She feels qualified relief. \u201cLook, man, do I want the world for young actresses now, do I want the moon and the stars for them? Yes. And I want them not to be sexually harassed\u2026 I want them not to go through bullshit.\u201d\nAs a director, Petty would gather in her crew for pep talks. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Good morning everyone! Remember, there\u2019s no smoking on set. No yelling. Oh. Also? No one touches my actors except hair and makeup and costume. No one. Ever. Thank you.\u2019 Every day I said that, every day.\u201d\nThe Poker House starred Jennifer Lawrence, then a teenager, in one of her first movie roles. Petty had trailer-buddied with Madonna, she\u2019d snog-teased Keanu and as soon as she saw Lawrence\u2019s audition tape, she smelled a coming star. \u201cGreat actress, astonishing to look at \u2013 and I\u2019m only talking about her looks because I noticed that she was just gravitational, on set. I would say [to men on the crew], \u2018Why are you touching her? Moving the hair out of her face? Then call hair and makeup!\u2019 It was just this energy that a 16-year-old girl who\u2019s super-gifted has. You have this energy and people want it. I know! I do these comic conventions. I don\u2019t get paid $50 for people to take a picture. I get it so they can touch me. That\u2019s what the $50 is for. It\u2019s not sexual, it\u2019s just: I-want-it-I-want-it.\u201d\nA decade before #MeToo and its cautious reforms, Petty tried to give Lawrence some advice from the perspective of someone who\u2019d once been a rising actress herself. \u201cI told Jennifer, \u2018Listen, if you have downtime, take a walk with one of the female assistants. Read a book. Watch a movie. Take a nap.\u2019 Then one day I saw her sitting under a tree with a grip who was 25. I said: \u2018Hey babe, what ya doin\u2019?\u2019 She goes: \u2018The wrong thing!\u2019 I said: \u2018No, no, no, you\u2019re not doing doing the wrong thing. You could just make a better choice. What\u2019s a better choice?\u2019 And she goes: \u2018Take a walk, read a book, take a nap\u2026?\u2019\u201d\nPetty snorts with laughter recalling this. Clearly she and the young Lawrence shared a similar sideways humour. When Petty finishes the anecdote it\u2019s with more solemnity though. \u201cSo, anyway, I told the 25-year-old grip to get lost,\u201d Petty recalls, \u201cthen I said to Jennifer, \u2018My love. You are carrying this movie on your back. Everybody wants your magic. [But] you only have a certain amount of it and you need to hold it in your heart so you can give it on screen. Then it lives for ever. These dumb boys? They\u2019re gonna try to take as much of that magic as they can. It\u2019s not their fault. You radiate love and joy and art. But you have to protect it. You have to protect it.\u2019\u201d\nA strange third chapter in Petty\u2019s career, after years in the wilderness, began in the mid-2010s. She was bored and she happened to watch an episode of Orange Is the New Black on her phone. A comedy-drama about women who\u2019d taken hard knocks, who weren\u2019t neat and conventional in their appearance, who could be silly and serious all at once? Petty dug around on the internet, found the number of the casting director, and called up to ask why on earth she wasn\u2019t a part of this thing.\nOne nice aspect of being a half-forgotten actor who people sometimes wonder about (Hey, whatever happened to Lori Petty?) is that people in Hollywood might return your call out of plain curiosity. \u201cThey wanna find out what the fuck Lori wants,\u201d as Petty puts it. Next thing she knew, she was indeed a part of Orange\u2026, filming several seasons as a conspiracy theorist called Lolly. Her prospects improved, though by 2019 she was still in a position to comment that she had never yet been hired for a role of note by a white American male.\nThis changed in the pandemic, when Patrick Somerville met Petty over Zoom to talk about Station Eleven. As soon as she read Somerville\u2019s scripts, which dealt with the ways that art can help people find stability in dire times, Petty was put in mind of lessons from her own youth, that however bad things get there can still be \u201clight, love, magic, creation. Those things don\u2019t go away, just because your circumstances are shit.\u201d\nSo here she is, in 2022, a Hollywood survivor, one of the stars of an era-defining TV show, back near penthouse height in a relentlessly up-and-down career. Petty can\u2019t account for the uncertainty of it all. \u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve it. And I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t deserve it. I just think, it is.\u201d\nHer phone rings again, probably her mum, calling back about the tooth. Before we finish the interview, Petty repeats some wisdom she\u2019s found useful in this uneven existence of hers. \u201cThey say worrying is paying money on a debt you don\u2019t owe. [I try to think] when is rent due? OK. And how much money do I need to pay it? OK.\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s about as far as I go.\u201d\nStation Eleven is available to stream in the UK on Starzplay via Amazon",

He also cited the mind-focusing impact of a near-death experience during a car accident last January. The accident \u201cmade me absolutely determined to make a contribution to the country\u201d.\nAlbanese said he was hopeful of victory in the looming contest. He suggested voters were growing tired of Scott Morrison. \u201cI think people are far more cynical about our opponents this time around, they know what Scott Morrison\u2019s form is and therefore they\u2019ll be more sceptical about what the government\u2019s saying.\n\u201cYou look at even the photo ops this time, whether it\u2019s the shampooing hair or whether it\u2019s dare I say it, the ukulele playing \u2026 the welding without lifting up the mask before you weld \u2013 people look at that and go, ah, that\u2019s not really his job.\u201d\nMorrison was interviewed by the program back in February with wife Jenny. The prime minister performed a rendition of the Dragon song April Sun in Cuba on the ukelele during the episode. Albanese said of the memorable cameo: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it and heard it, and \u2026 now it can\u2019t be unseen unfortunately.\u201d\nAlbanese was featured on the hustings in Tasmania. Stefanovic noted the Labor leader was pursuing a small-target strategy. The presenter said the \u201ccriticism\u201d was the Labor leader was \u201cbeing wrapped in cotton wool \u2013 his people are trying to protect [him] from any kind of mess up in the weeks leading up to an election exposure.\u201d\nThe Labor leader said: \u201cWell, here we are Karl doing 60 Minutes.\u201d\nAsked what he was \u201chiding\u201d, Albanese said: \u201cPeople might not always agree with me, but what you see is what you get. Scott Morrison\u2019s got an issue with the truth.\u201d\nThe Labor leader canvassed elements of his past during the program, including the story of finding his Italian father after the death of his mother, and the end of his marriage to Carmel Tebbutt in 2019.\nHe was frank about the emotional impact of the breakup. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the marriage to end.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see it as ending. We\u2019d spent Christmas together, I thought we would end our life together. That was the vision that I had.\u201d The end of his marriage \u201cwas really difficult to come to terms with\u201d.\nStefanovic asked Albanese whether he was \u201cin love\u201d with his new partner, Jodie Haydon. He replied: \u201cThat\u2019s something not for you, Karl. That\u2019s something between me and Jodie.\u201d\nAlbanese said he was \u201cprotective\u201d of his new relationship. \u201cI\u2019m the one running for public office.\n\u201cJodie has to put up with if we\u2019re out having dinner, put up with people coming up and photos and all of that. But it\u2019s part of the deal, it\u2019s part of who I am.\u201d\nAsked whether he shared any vices in common with the former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke, Albanese said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m a pretty straightforward bloke and I\u2019ve never had a cigarette in my life.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the odd beer or two or three or four.

And then every morning she gets up, has a cup of tea, and goes upstairs to look after everybody else\u2019s.\nSamuel holds a unique place in the British psyche, one seeded before she was born (into the banking side of the Guinness dynasty) and one that grew in complicated ways with her appearance in the tabloids alongside her friend Diana, Princess of Wales, evolving again as she became a counsellor, working in the NHS at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, where she pioneered the role of maternity and paediatric psychotherapist, and founded the charity Child Bereavement UK.\nNow 62, she\u2019s a bestselling author of books that attempt to guide readers through trauma and change, and consequently has become the public face of bereavement, so often the most darkly private thing. It was Samuel who Brendan Cox called before breaking the news of his wife\u2019s murder to their children, and (though neither have confirmed this) Samuel who Meghan Markle is believed to have called when she felt suicidal during pregnancy. This role, a sort of unofficial grief tsar, must bring with it a certain amount of pressure. \u201cI don\u2019t feel pressure,\u201d she smiles, \u201cI feel energy. The last few years I\u2019ve seen more suffering than I\u2019ve ever seen in my whole career. The fact that there was no bedside or graveside \u2013 it\u2019s been a much more complicated grief. Much more protracted, more traumatic. Seeing your partner die on an iPad while you\u2019re isolating at home is truly awful.\u201d What does she think the ripples from this will be? \u201cI think it\u2019ll enter the therapy rooms for years to come.\u201d\nIt\u2019s her therapy room we are in today, above her west London apartment at the top of five flights of carpeted stairs \u2013 she is used to waiting here for clients with a ready glass of water. We are meeting to discuss her third book. \u2013 It\u2019s about families, the place we love and hate hardest, the only relationship we can never leave. \u201cI became fascinated by how patterns in families get passed on. And how what isn\u2019t dealt with in one generation goes down to the next until someone\u2019s prepared to feel the pain. Often, it\u2019s the things that are unsaid that cause more harm than the event itself, or the stories that are made up to cover up the secrets.\u201d There are eight case studies, including the family of a gay couple adopting a daughter, the ultra-Orthodox family of a survivor of Auschwitz, and a family finally ready to deal with their father\u2019s suicide. Samuel unrolls each story like a delicate canvas, explaining her own emotional reactions along the way. She\u2019s often told she cries a lot for a therapist. \u201cWell, I\u2019m emotionally invested. And I couldn\u2019t put on a mask \u2013 I think part of being able to create a therapeutic relationship is that it\u2019s genuine. But I keep one foot in my world so I can move back and then be responsive. Because otherwise\u2026\u201d What? \u201cI\u2019m not doing my job properly.\u201d\nHer book begins with the line, \u201cEvery family has a story,\u201d except, her family never told theirs. She grew up in a house of privilege and ghosts, where her three siblings and twin brother were raised with stiff upper lips and framed photographs of the dead. At 20, she married, and over the next nine years had four children. Becoming a parent herself inspired her to think about her own parents\u2019 histories of addiction, and at 27 she went with a friend to an AA meeting. \u201cI heard people talking about how they actually felt. I had no idea that people could really do that \u2013 it was incredibly powerful. Now when I look back, I think I wanted to do this work because of all the unexpressed loss of my parents. But it took me a long time, and quite a lot of therapy to work that out.\u201d Over the course of writing this book, meeting families over Zoom, people who hadn\u2019t come to her to unpick their pasts but instead to deal with their painful presents, she found herself changed again.\n\u201cI was a very imperfect mother and I\u2019m also an imperfect grandmother,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cBut I\u2019m a bit more compassionate towards myself about it now. And I felt differently about my own parents, too, how they had been so impacted by their history, their losses. After writing the book, I \u2018got it\u2019 in a much deeper way.\u201d Can she tell me more about that? \u201cYou\u2019d be a very good therapist,\u201d Samuel smiles, and I wait, professionally. \u201cWell. I really love my [late] mum and dad, but they were quite old-school. I had understood psychologically why they didn\u2019t talk much about the people they\u2019d lost, for instance their parents in the First World War. But I think I still held some level of criticism for them. And now I can see they didn\u2019t really have any option.\u201d She\u2019s reluctant to talk about her own children, or how her (allegedly) \u201cimperfect\u201d parenting might have impacted them, but she will offer a quote from Nora Ephron. \u201cShe said: \u2018You know you\u2019ve brought up successful kids when they can earn enough to pay for their own therapy.\u2019 Ha!\u201d\nSamuel\u2019s destiny, when she was growing up, was the life of a comfortable housewife, perhaps a little light fundraising. And for a while it looked as though she was content with that \u2013 she worked as an interior decorator in the 1980s, sharing school pick-ups with Diana. \u201cBut I always liked work. The structure, the purpose of it. It\u2019s a big part of my identity. I like being a different person, being outside your family. I didn\u2019t know until later how meaningful that was.\u201d\nAt 31, after training, she went to work in the obstetric unit of St Mary\u2019s as its first counsellor for families whose children had died. Before then there was very little support around stillbirths in the UK. \u201cI think in some ways, not knowing what I didn\u2019t know supported me. So I listened and I cared.\u201d Her first case was a couple whose daughter had been born at 28 weeks and died a month later. Recently, walking through an airport, Samuel saw the mother again \u2013 they\u2019d had another child, he\u2019d recently got married, they hugged. She grins, remembering. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever get over a loss of a child, but by the time they stopped seeing me they did find a way of living with it.\u201d\nThree years later, Samuel founded a national charity that supports families and trains professionals to help when a child dies or is bereaved. \u201cIt was about getting the hospitals to stop saying, basically, \u2018You need to move on.\u2019\u201d In practice that meant things such as encouraging maternity units to help parents of stillborn babies to take photos and footprints, to have a proper funeral. \u201cSo that they have memories, really. Because the moments between the birth and the funeral is the only time they\u2019ll ever have with that baby. And they can\u2019t go back and put that right. You need to give them time to make important decisions: do I dress them in this? Will the siblings come and see the baby? All that felt very\u2026 significant.\u201d\nIt occurs to me that through her work Samuel is providing a map to lead her parents\u2019 generation, whose framed photos of lost relatives took the place of conversation about death, towards a healthier future where grief is understood, acceptable and sometimes messy. For all her celebrity attachments, it\u2019s her ability to act as a link that will be her legacy. She pauses to consider. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it like that. But yes, I\u2019ve taken the learning from my experience and used it to improve the experiences of other people. Talking about death and bereavement is unbearable, so I want everyone to get the support they need, from the institutions but also from their family, so they don\u2019t say the wrong things.\u201d What are the wrong things? \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t worry, you can have another one!\u2019 Or, \u2018They were so little, you didn\u2019t even know them.\u2019\u201d She shudders slightly.\nBefore working with a gay couple who were planning to adopt a baby she \u201cimmersed\u201d herself in research papers, LGBTQ+ books, data and memoirs, and \u201cgave herself a sharp dig\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I was so heterosexually biased,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a wonderful expansion of understanding.\u201d It\u2019s striking throughout her book how regularly Samuel names her privilege, pausing in the narrative to describe the research she took on or the discomfort she felt. \u201cWell, of course. The thing I always start with is that when we work together, we bring our histories with us. Our histories will meet and if I have misunderstood what you\u2019re saying or what your experiences are, let me know. But what I didn\u2019t take on board before was the level of privilege I have just walking into a shop. And not having that experience of being looked at like a Black woman might, or their weathering of anxiety of being a black body in a white space. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning all the time. I still find it uncomfortable. But there\u2019s no way I can work authentically with people without naming our differences of experience.\u201d\nWhen she left St Mary\u2019s after 25 years, she began working with adults who were dying. \u201cIt put me much more in touch with my own mortality.\u201d She wrote down all her passwords and WhatsApped a photo of them to her children, \u201ctelling them I have prepared everything that I\u2019d want when I died, that I didn\u2019t want to be resuscitated, all these kinds of things\u201d. She\u2019d realised we need to be talking about death when we are alive and well. \u201cThere was a woman I was seeing whose friends would not talk to her about the fact she was dying. They kept saying things like, \u2018The medicine is amazing, you\u2019re going to be fine.\u2019 And she was never going to be fine. That had a big impact.\u201d\nSometimes Samuel recites an acronym: Fine \u2013 freaked out, insecure, neurotic and emotional. But spending her time facing death did two things to her. It made her grateful for her own life and that of the people she loves. And it made her turn off the TV. \u201cYes, when I\u2019m not working I want nothing to do with death. So I don\u2019t watch sad films. I don\u2019t read sad books. I don\u2019t watch the news. I do everything that is to do with life and vibrancy and happy endings.\u201d She started kickboxing 28 years ago, \u201cbecause it makes me feel fierce and strong\u201d. Seated still, she shows me two stabby little punches before smoothing down the dark florals of her dress. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of releasing all my frustration \u2013 I find it incredibly satisfying.\u201d What does she think about when she\u2019s boxing? \u201cPeople\u2019s stories that I\u2019m upset about, or more often nothing at all \u2013 I just feel pure, pure joy.\u201d\nFighting is something that matters to Samuel. Despite her boxing skills, \u201cI am not very good at fighting,\u201d she says. \u201cBut inevitably where we love most we also annoy each other most. And if we keep swallowing what\u2019s annoyed us, it causes a separation. Fighting productively means not using words as weapons of mass destruction.\u201d The crucial thing is the repair \u2013 when everyone has calmed down, she says it\u2019s important to discuss what the fight was really about. \u201cAnd it may have been that your mum forgot your swimming kit that morning. But it also could have been that you feel sad because you felt forgotten. Then you feel closer and more trusting, because you can fight and still be loved.\u201d As she was reminded by working with families over lockdown, sometimes these fights are never resolved. Like that forgotten swimming kit, they ripen and grow mould, poisoning relationships for decades to come. \u201cProblems get buried and then dragged up. And so, you don\u2019t feel loved afterwards, you feel injured. And that can stay in you forever.\u201d I say I feel like this should be part of the curriculum. \u201cDefinitely!\u201d\nSo, I must ask\u2026 I start. \u201cOh, must you?\u201d she winces. We have to talk about her relationship with Diana and her sons \u2013 Samuel is godmother to Prince George and as such remains a figure of intense interest, with details of the type of presents she gives him (large, noisy and with many complicated pieces for William to put together) verging on front page news. \u201cWell, I feel lucky I was such a good friend of Princess Diana. And I really love my godson, George. And it\u2019s a lovely way of loving her,\u201d she says, elegantly. I wonder how much influence she had on the princes\u2019 decision, which at the time felt so radical, to talk publiclyabout their own mental health. \u201cI think both the princes have really turned the dial on talking about grief so honestly and also about mental health. But that was all theirs \u2013 completely off their own bats.\u201d I remember driving through London the nights following Diana\u2019s death, seeing all the flowers, their scent heavy on the wind. How did it feel to grieve her friend\u2019s death privately when strangers were grieving so loudly? \u201cI felt angry,\u201d she says. \u201cI was angry that she died, and shocked and I couldn\u2019t really understand it all. I mean, I understand it better now.\u201d I wait. \u201cI understand that people felt they really knew and loved her. But I still feel sad today.\u201d\nShe looks a little pained and I apologise \u2013 it\u2019s one thing to ask her to talk about grief, it\u2019s quite another to ask repeatedly about a friend who died 25 years ago. \u201cI feel that in some ways, my professional life is completely separate from my friendships and private life. But, of course, nothing is separate. Who I am and who I know is also part of my professional self. And so\u2026\u201d she shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d\nI ready myself to go back outside, into a square behind Hyde Park where the country is limping back to work after months at home. As well as grief, Samuel has seen in her clients the smaller irritations the pandemic has caused, the anxieties, the pains. \u201cBut pain is the agent of change. So we have to allow this new reality to hit us. And it\u2019s uncomfortable, so we have to support ourselves through it, mainly through love and connection.\u201d How does she deal with change? \u201cI really don\u2019t like it, so I resist.\u201d And then? \u201cAnd then,\u201d she grins, leaning forward in her consulting chair, \u201cI swallow my own medicine.\u201d\nJulia Samuel reflects on her own family\u2019s trauma in this extract from her new book\nThe story of the family I was born into was one of great privilege and multiple traumas. But we didn\u2019t tell stories. There was no narrative or understanding of what had been, what was going on, or how to deal with it. My parents were young adults during the Second World War. My father was in the Navy and my mother was a Land Girl. But that was not where their injuries lay. My mother\u2019s parents and two siblings had all died suddenly and unexpectedly by the time she was 25 years old. My father\u2019s father and brother had also died, without warning, when he was still a young man. Their fathers had fought in the First World War. As with the majority of people living in that era, and as my generation of baby-boomers can attest, they abided by the need to survive and multiply. They had admirable tenacity, grit and courage. Their route to survival, the only one open to them, was to forget and move on. They lived by the adage that what you don\u2019t talk or think about won\u2019t hurt you. Putting on a good show, hiding vulnerability and, yes, a stiff upper lip were the mantras of my childhood and that of most of my generation. But even when it\u2019s out of sight \u2013 perhaps especially when it\u2019s out of sight \u2013 the fingerprint of love and loss inside us continues to gather complexity. It isn\u2019t always visible to the naked eye, but is still complicated, still textured, still painful.\nWhat is often not recognised is that behaviours like these are the legacy of trauma. Trauma doesn\u2019t have language. Trauma has no concept of time. It sits on high alert in our bodies, ready to be ignited many decades after the original traumatic event. It doesn\u2019t allow for the processing of emotion. For me it meant many pieces of the jigsaw were missing. I remember looking at black-and-white photographs of my dead grandparents, aunts and uncles, examining them for clues because I knew practically nothing about them. The first time I saw a photograph of my maternal grandfather was this year. There were so many secrets and so much was left unsaid that I look back at my parents now and wonder: what did they know? What did they think about? Did they know what they felt? As a couple, did they ever talk about the things that mattered to them? And those secrets, did they tell each other or not? They certainly didn\u2019t voice any of it within my earshot.\nThis meant I was constantly observing and listening for clues. As it turned out it was the perfect brew to ferment a psychotherapist: I was always curious, listening intently, keenly interested in what was happening behind the fa\u00e7ade, like a detective looking in the dust for footprints.\nMy parents have died yet they live on in me, continually shaping and influencing me, as do all our key relationships. I am hugely grateful to them. I learnt from them many crucial skills, behaviours and ways of being that serve me well. I still benefit now from the immense opportunities they gave me.\nI am no different from my clients \u2013 every one I have counselled has focused on their family. They want to know why they have difficulty with their relatives or describe why they love them, and everything in between. In my therapy, I spent great tracts of time exploring my family of origin and my family now, trying to make sense of what was going on.\nAt its best, family is the safe place where we can be our whole selves, with all of our frailties and faultlines, and still be loved and deeply understood. Ideally, it is a place where the roots of our development are fully known, the atmosphere we grew up in acknowledged.\nWhen they are \u201cgood enough\u201d, as Donald Winnicott, the eminent paediatrician and psychoanalyst, termed it, families form the bedrock of our lives, a foundation that keeps us steady when we face the brickbats of life. When functioning well, we can turn to our family in adversity, and for team support. When the external world feels fractured and alienating, home and family can be a refuge to heal and rebuild our strength.\nWe may not see our family, but they are still part of us, genetically, in our memories and our unconscious. We can never leave them, as we can a partner or a friendship.\nThere are ongoing debates about nature and nurture. When we are born we are given a genetic blueprint: our propensity for intelligence, athleticism and character traits, and we know that their potential can be fulfilled or blunted by our environment. The random luck of what kind of family we are born into, wealth or poverty, history, psychological health and family patterns, influences the quality of the nurture. But at the heart of wellbeing is our core identity: \u201cI am loved and I belong. This family is my home and safe place whatever happens to me or them.\u201d\nFrom my own experience and what I have learnt from the families I see, when comparing non-biologically and biologically related families, the stories we tell ourselves become who we are. When we are told truthful stories, we trust that we are loved and belong. And we thrive, whatever our genetic inheritance or connection.\nFamilies are messy, chaotic and imperfect. Where we love and care most, we also hurt most, fight hardest and make our deepest mistakes. Yet we thrive when our family is held securely within and around us. It is worth the effort, heartache and strife. When we can trust in it, it can be the force that holds us together when our world is upended. Even across great distances, when our family is at the centre of our being it can help us find our own equilibrium despite the disorder and madness in the world.\nThe best thing we can do to help this is to prioritise our family, in our hearts, our minds \u2013 and with our time.\nEvery Family Has a Story by Julia Samuel is published by Penguin Life on 17 March at \u00a314.99.

        "content": "Leader Ed Davey\u2019s comments come as Michael Gove announces details of \u2018homes for Ukraine\u2019 scheme\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has called for the home secretary, Priti Patel, to be sacked over her handling of the Ukrainian refugee crisis.\n\u201cPriti Patel\u2019s response to this humanitarian catastrophe \u2013 the biggest in Europe since world war two \u2013 is utterly shameful,\u201d Davey told the Lib Dems\u2019 spring conference.\n\u201cShe has answered desperation with delays. Crisis with confusion. Pain with paperwork. It couldn\u2019t be clearer that Priti Patel is not up to the job. The buck stops with the prime minister. So Boris Johnson must sack her, now.\u201d\nThe government has faced furious criticism in recent days over its slow and bureaucratic response to the Ukraine refugee crisis, including from its own MPs, after ministers decided not to follow the EU\u2019s lead and waive the need for visas.\nPatel told MPs last week it was important for the government to carry out security checks, but some of her cabinet colleagues have been irritated at the way the issue has been handled.\nThe levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has announced details of a \u201chomes for Ukraine\u201d scheme, which will allow individuals, charities and companies to sponsor refugees. He said local councils would be given \u00a310,000 for each person welcomed into their area under the plan, and he called for \u201cevery available bed\u201d to be offered.\nHouseholds will be invited to register from Monday if they are willing to provide a room for a Ukrainian refugee. Gove said charities could then help to match them with individuals seeking sanctuary.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that every available bed that we have in this country that can be made available, every available home that can be made available, to those who are fleeing persecution, is mobilised, and we know that there a large number of people in this country, generous-hearted and in a position to provide homes \u2013 and businesses and charities as well,\u201d he said on Sunday.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is saying we the government will act in solidarity and in cooperation with you.\u201d He said the government would pay \u00a3350 a month to families hosting a refugee, which they would have to agree to do for at least six months.\nThe refugees would be allowed to work, Gove said. They would be entitled to NHS care and their children could attend local schools while they were in the UK. He said local authorities would be offered \u00a310,000 for each individual to help facilitate that, with additional payments for children.\nGove said he thought the scheme could lead to tens of thousands of refugees being housed in the UK. He also clarified reports that he was planning to seize the homes of oligarchs who have been placed under sanctions in order to house refugees.\nHe said: \u201cI want to explore an option that would allow us to use the homes and properties of sanctioned individuals, for as long as they are sanctioned, for humanitarian and other purposes.\u201d\nHe acknowledged there was a \u201cquite a high legal bar to cross\u201d, however, and said even if it did go ahead, it would not mean \u201cpermanent confiscation\u201d of the properties involved. \u201cWhile you are not using or profiting from it, if we can use it in order to help others, let\u2019s do that,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s Sunday Morning programme.\nGove said the UK had accepted 3,000 applications for visas and pointed to Patel\u2019s announcement last week of a new web-based application process due to come into force on Tuesday.\nAsked whether he would be signing up to provide a room to a refugee himself, Gove said: \u201cI am going to make sure that I do everything I can as an individual to support. Every individual will have their own circumstances.\u201d\nResponding to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 criticism, a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe home secretary this week announced changes that will make it simpler and quicker for those fleeing Putin\u2019s barbaric war to come to the UK, while balancing national security considerations given the real and varied threats we face.\n\u201cSince 2015, the UK has resettled more refugees through safe and legal routes than any other European country. Under the home secretary\u2019s tenure, the Home Office has welcomed the final of the 20,000 refugees from Syria, 20,000 Afghans and 97,000 Hong Kongers. The facts just do not support these accusations.\u201d\nThe Irish taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, told the BBC on Sunday that his country had already accepted 5,500 refugees from Ukraine. \u201cOur primary impulse is to assist those fleeing war. The Irish people are very seized by the series of atrocities that are going on, what we are witnessing on our screens is really shocking people and there\u2019s huge human empathy there,\u201d he said.\nLast week the Irish government said Patel had contacted Dublin to raise security concerns about the number of people Ireland was accepting and the risk that they could enter Northern Ireland.",

Mindful of present-day resonances, grassroots projects are springing up across Scotland to discover more about the women who were wrongly accused of witchcraft and to memorialise them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots more to do,\u201d said Claire Mitchell QC, who established the Witches of Scotland campaign in 2020, before bringing a petition seeking apology and pardon, as well as a national memorial, before the Holyrood parliament earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019re keen to get the pardon because it marks a legal status change. It\u2019s important for any human to be properly recorded in history.\u201d\nThe SNP MSP Natalie Don is bringing a member\u2019s bill for a pardon, with the consultation to launch imminently.\nThe first minister\u2019s statement was \u201cmassive\u201d, said Sara Kelly of the charity Remembering the Accused Witches of Scotland (RAWS). Set up in 2019, Raws has also approached the Church of Scotland for an apology and has ambitious plans to offer education packs to all schools in Scotland. The charity is also pressing for both national and community memorialising: most recently a street in St Monans was renamed after Maggie Morgan, who was accused of witchcraft after giving birth to an illegitimate child fathered by the son of an influential Fife family.\nKelly points to a swell of grassroots groups researching local prosecutions. \u201cThe scale of persecution was incredible,\u201d she said, with Scotland carrying out five times the European average of executions per capita. She added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s not really talked about in local communities. It makes you look at the place you live in a different way and ask if that discrimination still happens now in other forms.\u201d\nMairi Harkness is part of one such project in West Lothian, aiming to uncover more about five women from the parish of Calder who were strangled then burned at the stake.\n\u201cProsecutions for witchcraft may seem far removed from our lives now, but we believe this offers an opportunity to better understand issues that still affect us today,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the UK stereotypical expectations about how men and woman should act persist, we still see outspoken women viewed and treated harshly and women are still expected to mitigate their behaviour to protect themselves from male violence. Globally people are persecuted for witchcraft and women often disproportionately suffer the consequences of religious extremism.\u201d\nThe historian Mary W Craig, who recently published a study of witch trials in the Scottish Borders, believes the fate of accused witches has pricked the public conscience over the past three years because of a combination of factors. \u201cWith the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, people also wanted to talk about the levels of historic justice available to different groups,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, the academic appetite for further research is deepening, with the University of Edinburgh advertising for two interns to work on the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, a database of known prosecutions and one of the most comprehensive in Europe.\nContinued academic inquiry is essential to acknowledge past atrocities and for greater perspective on our modern behaviours, says Michelle Brock, an associate professor of history at Washington and Lee University in the US. In 2017, Brock wrote for the Washington Post, explaining the historical incongruence of claims that powerful men such as Harvey Weinstein were subject to a witch-hunt, when in reality these persecutions targeted marginalised people and brutally enforced gender hierarchies.\n\u201cIn examining events like the great witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, we get a window into the tremendous power of things like belief, fear, propaganda, gender norms and reputation. This is a critical reminder for us not to be overly confident or complacent in the \u2018rightness\u2019 and \u2018rationality\u2019 of our own time, because without doubt we believe things and commit acts today that, 400 years from now, people will find as shocking as we do the witch-hunts.\u201d",

If the opening of the Dance Reflections season had featured the cleanest of compositions in Lucinda Childs\u2019 1979 Dance, Katerina Andreou\u2019s BSTRD (2018) is a down-and-dirty feat of endurance, throbbing with a force at once vital and oppressive. Lights flare aggressively behind a raised platform. Andreou, determinedly casual in T-shirt, trousers and trainers, places a record on a turntable. It plays a hammering pulse, nail-like beats and a skull-drilling drone, all on a primordial four-count rhythm that keeps its stranglehold on the piece throughout.\n  Part clubber, part folk dancer, always a slave to the rhythm, Andreou jogs, bops, bounces, jiggles and sidesteps, first straight-on, then side-on, then round the edges, each rudimentary step combo repeated right, then left, then right, then left.\n  Sameness highlights moments of difference. She takes off her T-shirt. There\u2019s an identical one beneath. She escapes from the platform, then returns to it. She flips the record. The B-side plays the same rhythm. There\u2019s one big, nonreversible change: the end. Andreou exits, leaving chalky clouds and soothing piano chords hanging in the air. The physical and mental relief is palpable. Worth it?\nStill, it\u2019s clear that Andreou is in pursuit of a path and a purpose. Christian Rizzo\u2019s une maison (2019) follows a far more desultory, dreamlike dramaturgy. A mysterious white-masked man opens the set and mythic apparitions emerge several times: totemic celebrants in animal-head masks, figures towering in long conical hats, a ghost draped in white. Above the stage hangs an irregular lattice of strip lights, which flicker and glow like neurons in some artificial brain. Below, a pyramid of earth is dispersed in billowing spadefuls, and pairs of people ritually upend buckets of soil, raked over by the cone-heads.\n  As the soundtrack veers from squeaks and crackles to booming beats, and back again, the 14-strong cast draw from a common repertoire of moves: low lunge, seated pike, shoulder stand, hand-holds, head-pushes. This imparts a loose coherence to the disparate group, which tightens at the end into a chain dance, in those animal masks, like a unified tribe. A dreamworld may need no sense of direction, but this journey has been, and felt like, a very rambling trip.\n Dance Reflections festival continues until 23 March.",

Jane Shaw\nPlease send new questions to nq@theguardian.com.\nBeyond the factors mentioned I think it could also depend to a large extent on circumstances and willpower. Say, for example, that (to take a random imaginary instance) you were extremely rich and determined to thwart your hopeless son\u2019s aspiration to become king, the answer might even be indefinitely. ThereisnoOwl\nOne thing I\u2019ve noticed about very long-lived people is that they remain part of a tightly knit community, and they also remain interested in life. The solutions to a long life, apart from the luck of the genetic draw, may well have more to do with the emotional bonds of community than with pollution. The other point to note is long life and what? There\u2019s no point living to 120 if you\u2019re all crumbly when you get there. So then it\u2019s long life, and good health, and mental alertness, and physical fitness that we\u2019re looking for \u2026 which is quite an ask. Lastly, of course, the saddest part of living a long life is everyone you know and love dying. I\u2019ve seen people just give up when a spouse or sibling has died. And to offset that, of course a closely knit community. But in the end, how long would you want to live anyway, by yourself, with no one to giggle at your stupid 90s memes? Mollybee\nThe question assumes that the ageing process is environmentally regulated. While things such as smoking and driving like a loon have obvious disadvantages, ageing is a biological process. The rate at which your telomeres fray, the accumulation of random errors in individual cells\u2019 DNA, and the depletion of stem cells to replace old cell lines play a part in determining your lifespan. Longevity often runs in families, which suggests that inherited factors are involved. I doubt that living the life of a nun is worth the extra few years it may bring anyway. letsbeclearaboutthis\nThe theoretical maximum lifespan for humans is about 150 years. This is related to an evaluation of human resilience \u2013 the ability to withstand and recover from disease to maintain a normal physiological equilibrium. A useful parameter for quantifying resilience is the dynamic organism state indicator.\nApropos of nothing, it is comical to see the interest in longevity from billionaires. Their detachment from the rest of us seems to inevitably lead to a ludicrous messiah complex. It reveals how completely out of touch these people are and how little they offer.\nThis is not to say scientific interest in ageing is without merit. It is an integral part in many approaches to preventing the onset of age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neuro-degenerative disease. But to achieve an immortal Zuckerberg would hardly be the end goal.\nQuality, not quantity, is a maxim that can be broadly applied. My view is that it includes the time we spend on Earth. We grow, we age, and we die to make room for the new. That\u2019s it. Self-betterment, close relationships and community are what makes it worthwhile. All the rest is vanity. In my view. Hakadalan\nDon\u2019t forget the genes (longevity is affected by inheritance) or gender (oldest are generally female). Recorded maximum age seems to be 110-120 years or so, but according to Google, the record is Jeanne Calment (1875\u20131997) of France, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days. I would not bet on much over 110 myself even with good luck and a healthy lifestyle. Hilary Gee\nMuch depends on genetic predisposition to disease, perhaps even more so than environmental factors. Live your life in the present, don\u2019t worry about when you\u2019re going to die, life is to be lived, enjoy every moment, try not to abuse your body too much while doing it. WTobiasJr\nI\u2019m not questioning your sentiment in the matter, and your advice seems sound enough, but what is your epidemiological evidence? Some individuals inherit biological problems which may affect their lifespan, but that doesn\u2019t apply to whole populations. Sickle cell anaemia in west Africa is a well-known exception.\nResearch in Britain dating from the 1970/80s made it quite clear that death rates were related to social class. Recent ONS figures, here reported by the Kings Fund show, that \u201cpeople living in more affluent areas live significantly longer than people living in deprived areas. In 2017\u201319, males in the least-deprived 10% of areas in England could expect to live to 83.5 years, almost a decade longer than males in the 10% most-deprived areas (74.1 years).\u201d It\u2019s important that these numbers are pre-pandemic as that has had an effect, but not in terms of making things more equal. The grim reaper has your postcode. Fallowfield\nIf you live like that, avoiding all inflammatory markers such as, well, basically all the fun things in life, you won\u2019t live to be 100, but you\u2019ll feel as if you have. PaulVanSalle\nMy grandmother lived to 107, marbles intact and physically OK until the last year or so. She took up line dancing in her 90s, was usually out if I called in to her care home and was a member of every group in her village for decades. Stay connected, keep learning, be active. Those things. BusyLizzie2\nMy grandmother on my dad\u2019s side lived to 103. She was antisocial, even towards her own family at times, lived in a care home for the last few years of her life, didn\u2019t mix with the residents, had no interests and no friends. She did have all her marbles, was just about mobile but had a stroke about a week before she died where she was bedridden and totally lost the power of speech. It\u2019s always been a mystery as to how she kept going for so long when she really didn\u2019t appear to enjoy life that much. solentview\nBloody-mindedness. Same as with my German gran. nina1414\nI have the ambition to reach the age of 131, rather less than 50 years from now. Simple statistics show that very few, if any, people die after that age. It will probably take me until then to achieve all things I ever wanted to do. Something to look forward to. Sounds good to me. After that, I wouldn\u2019t mind dying in bed, not necessarily shot by a jealous husband. Raimoh105\nPeople tend to forget that living to a great age just means they\u2019re likely to be old and decrepit for longer. betweencloudshadows\nThe recent research (published on Science) showed that a small reduction of food intake (14%) could significantly improve immune response and reduce chances of inflammation as well as losing weight. This was based on a two-year random study of healthy adults. The implication seems it could prolong healthy span of life in humans (as well as in mice already proven). Hillside\n\u201cMillions long for immortality who don\u2019t know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon.\u201d Susan Ertz. Having an uncle who lived to be 100 and a mother who just celebrated her 95th, having a close family who live with you or nearby really helps living to an old age. And being generally healthy. JohnInAthlone\nCommunities in Chernobyl were forced to evacuate in 1986 \u2026 but some refused to leave. It turned out that those who were removed suffered terribly and couldn\u2019t settle down, and in many, if not most cases, were outlived by those who insisted on staying put in their communities in the Chernobyl area. Having a sense of meaning and a sense of belonging seems to be the important factor in this. wetsuitboots\nTroy: \u201cWho wants to live to be 89?\u201d\n Barnaby: \u201cSomeone who\u2019s 88.\u201d Inoubliable\nJeanne Calment lived to 122 and we can assume that\u2019s about the natural limit, give or take a year, without some kind of external therapy to halt or reverse senescence \u2013 which may not be far off. Modern medicine probably won\u2019t extend that extreme but just bring the rest of us closer to it, and in better health to the very end rather than in an extended decrepitude.\nIt\u2019s hard to know the ideal \u201crecipe\u201d for longevity though; it\u2019s probably person-specific and it may be the degree of exposure of one factor (eg alcohol, pollutants, virii) to one person is negative, but to another their body pushes against and makes them more robust in the long run. HaveYouFedTheFish\nThus far the answer is 120-something, and only a tiny fraction of a percentage of people will achieve that. There\u2019s little or no evolutionary selection for extreme old age. People who live a really long time past the age of reproduction are effectively rolling the dice and getting double six again and again. As the question implies you can load the dice in your favour by following medical advice, but some time before your 125th birthday some irreplaceable part of your body will stop working, and then so will you.\nIn the future things may be different, because we will probably become much better at maintaining and repairing our bodies and brains. This will increase the percentage of people who make it past 120, and perhaps allow some to live decades longer. Those who do so will have to work at it \u2013 a lifelong regimen of diet, exercise and medication. I don\u2019t know if I want to work that hard. There is reasonable evidence that calorie restriction extends mammalian lifespans. One hundred and forty years, all of it quite hungry? That sounds like a really long time. SemiFunctional\nSardinia has plenty of centenarians \u2013 and they drink a drop of wine each day, just a drop. By the way, if we ultimately aim at \u201ceternal life\u2019,\u201d we should remember that Tithonus, in Greek mythology, was sentenced to this as a punishment. Bloreheath\nHow long would anybody live? On average, not a lot longer than they do now. What shortens life significantly is low income. To which we can add a few particularly hazardous habits, such as smoking, or hazardous occupations. If you\u2019re living in a developed country with a better than average income, not smoking, and a few potentially fatal diseases can be controlled, your life expectancy is not far off the hypothetical maximum as far as current medical practice sees it. Most of the aims of current health policy are about addressing \u201cpremature\u201d deaths, essentially treating identifiable causes that shorten life. It\u2019s not about extending life for all, that is not seen as a practical aim.\nThe question in the headline is about possible lifespan (which doesn\u2019t appear to be what was asked), that\u2019s luck. There are combinations of genes, lifestyle, environment, but mostly chance, that allow some individuals to live to near 120 years. The trick is the combination is so rare it\u2019s not obvious what makes those factors any different from conditions that are merely \u201cgood\u201d. The extremely long lived are outliers; any normal distribution will throw up a few individuals at the extremes of the curve. The shortest lived are lost among the \u201caccidents\u201d and a disease toll that takes a percentage at all ages.\nThe longest lived, however, and whatever circumstances those few need, are clearly becoming seen more frequently. At time of writing, the third- and fourth-longest lived individuals ever are still alive. Perhaps more remarkable is that of the 100 authenticated longest lived women, and the 100 longest lived men ever, only one died before 1985 and more than 80% of them were still living into the year 2000 and beyond. leadballoon",

He had had heart problems from birth and it was his third surgery.\nHer relationship with the children\u2019s biological father had broken down and the couple had divorced. While working in the UK she met and then married Adil Arslan, 43, a British citizen, and the couple tried to bring Maksym and Alina to the UK to join the couple\u2019s three-year-old daughter, Stefani.\nThe children were cared for in Ukraine by Hil\u2019s parents, Mykhailo Kulchytski and Stefaniia Kulchytska, in the village of Teklivka, about 25 miles (40km) from Ternopil in western Ukraine.\nBut the Home Office refused permission for the children to come over. Officials wrote a letter to Alina, who does not speak English, on 1 November last year, saying: \u201cTo demonstrate that you are related to your sponsor (mother) as claimed you have submitted your birth certificate. Please provide additional evidence to show that you are related to your sponsor as claimed.\u201d\nShe was also asked to send officials a description of what involvement her biological father had with her life. The family say there has been no contact since 2016.\nAfter the Home Office\u2019s refusal, an appeal was lodged by the family\u2019s solicitors, which was due to be heard on 22 March.\nIn the refusal letter, government officials wrote that Hil had not demonstrated satisfactorily that she had sole responsibility for her children, and that there were no \u201cexceptional circumstances in the appellants\u2019 cases that would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for refusing the applications\u201d.\nDespite the Home Office\u2019s refusal to grant the children\u2019s visa, Arslan said he was determined to rescue the children as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\u201cTetiana was crying day and night about the danger the children were in in Ukraine. She couldn\u2019t go herself as she has to look after three-year-old Stefani so I said I would go and get them,\u201d he said.\nAfter a 20-hour drive he arrived at Poland\u2019s border with Ukraine and collected everyone. He took the family to the visa processing centre in Brussels and after a few days officials agreed to overturn the visa application refusal for the two children. Arslan drove back and forth between Calais and Brussels to complete the process , and finally was able to reunite the two children with their mother in the early hours of Friday morning.\nBut the children\u2019s grandparents\u2019 visa had not come through. That morning, after snatching a few hours sleep in the UK, Arslan drove back to Brussels to collect his in-laws after the visas were finally issued. He said his marathon journey of about 3,000 miles (4,800km) in five days was worth it \u201cto see the smiles on everyone\u2019s faces\u201d.\n\u201cWe are happy, happy, happy now,\u201d said Hil, who moved to the UK in 2018. \u201cAt last our family can be together and safe from this terrible war in my country. The children say the sky is different here from the sky in Ukraine because there are no bombs falling out of it.\n\u201cI am so upset that the Home Office did not allow my children to come and join us before the war started. We did everything right with the application and sent a lot of documents. If they had granted permission when we applied for it my children could have avoided the war and would not have had to witness the shelling and the sirens.\n\u201cThey spent a lot of the time after the war started hiding in the cellar with my parents where we store the potatoes and carrots we grow. There is not much air down there but the children were frightened to go outside.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said they would not comment on the case, but said: \u201cWe are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we\u2019ve made it easier for those with Ukrainian passports to come here.\u201d",

Filmed describing what had occurred while he was receiving hospital treatment, he suggested they had driven into an ambush.\n\u201cWe crossed the first bridge in Irpin. We were going to film all the refugees leaving. We got into a car \u2026 Someone offered to take us to the other bridge and we crossed a checkpoint and they started shooting at us,\u201d Arredondo said. \u201cSo the driver turned around, and they kept shooting \u2026 and there was two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud and he\u2019s been shot and left behind.\u201d\nWhen the interviewer asked how Renaud was, Arredondo replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I saw he\u2019d been shot in the neck. And we got split.\u201d\nThe US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN: \u201cIf in fact an American journalist was killed, it is a shocking and horrifying event. It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces as they\u2019ve targeted schools and mosques and hospitals and journalists.\n\u201cAnd it is why we are working so hard to impose severe consequences on him, and to try to help the Ukrainians with every form of military assistance we can muster, to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces.\u201d",

        "content": "The director Jane Campion has called the actor Sam Elliott \u201ca little bit sexist\u201d and \u201ca bitch\u201d, for criticising The Power of the Dog, her Oscar- and Bafta-nominated western, for its driving theme of repressed homosexual desire and for being filmed in New Zealand.\nCampion\u2019s film has 12 Oscar nominations, including best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor (Benedict Cumberbatch), best supporting actress (Kirsten Dunst) and two nominations for best supporting actor (Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons). Campion is the first woman to be nominated for best director twice.\nCampion spoke to Variety at the Directors Guild of America awards in Los Angeles on Saturday, at which she won the award for outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film.\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, he was being a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H. I\u2019m sorry to say it but he\u2019s not a cowboy, he\u2019s an actor. The west is a mythic space and there\u2019s a lot of room on the range. I think it\u2019s a little bit sexist.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI consider myself a creator. I think he thinks of me as a woman or something lesser first.\u201d\nElliott, who has starred in numerous westerns, spoke last month on Marc Maron\u2019s WTF podcast.\n\u201cYeah, you wanna talk about that piece of shit?\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like that one?\u201d Maron asked.\n\u201cFuck no,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWhy? I\u2019ll tell you why I didn\u2019t like it anyway. I looked at [it] when I was down there in Texas doing [the TV series] 1883 \u2026\n\u201cThere was a fucking full page ad out in the LA Times, and there was a clip, and it talked about the evisceration of the American myth. And I thought \u2018What the fuck? What the fuck?\u2019 This is the guy that\u2019s done westerns forever. The evisceration of the American west? They made it look like \u2013 what are all those dancers, those guys in New York that wear bowties and not much else? Remember them from back in the day?\u201d\nMaron suggested he meant the Chippendales, an all-male strip troupe.\nElliott said: \u201cThat\u2019s what all these fucking cowboys in that movie looked like, running around in chaps and no shirts. There were all these allusions to homosexuality throughout the fucking movie.\u201d\nMaron said: \u201cI think that\u2019s what the movie\u2019s about.\u201d\nElliott said: \u201cWell, what the fuck does this woman from down there \u2013 she\u2019s a brilliant director \u2013 know about the American west, and why the fuck did she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana and say, \u2018This is the way it was.\u2019 That fucking rubbed me the wrong way, pal.\n\u201cThe myth is that they were these macho men out there with the cattle. I just come from fucking Texas where I was hanging out with families, not men, families, big, long, extended, multiple-generation families.\u201d\nElliott also complained about Campion\u2019s star, saying: \u201cI mean, Cumberbatch never got out of his fucking chaps. He had two pairs of chaps \u2013 a woolly pair and a leather pair. And every fucking time he would walk in from somewhere \u2013 he never was on a horse, maybe once \u2013 he\u2019d walk into the fucking house, storm up the fucking stairs, go lay in his bed in his chaps and play his banjo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, what the fuck?\u201d\nEarlier this month, the Guardian published an interview in which Campion was asked: \u201cDid you ever worry about overdoing all the leather and ropes and chaps?\u201d\nCampion said: \u201cI encouraged it! I loved it because they looked like satyrs. And when I looked at the pictures from the period, big woolies are really common; I guess Montana\u2019s super-cold. So wearing a sheep on each leg is sort of helpful.\u201d\nElliott also asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the western in this western?\u201d\nIn partial answer, Campion told Variety: \u201cWhen you think about the number of amazing westerns made in Spain by Sergio Leone, I consider myself a creator.\u201d\nOf Elliott, she said: \u201cI think he thinks of me as a woman or something lesser first, and I don\u2019t appreciate that.\u201d",

        "content": "Former UN secretary general says countries face stark choices brought on by the war in Ukraine\nThe former UN secretary general has warned the UK against fracking, as the world stands at a \u201cdangerous\u201d point in the climate crisis, brought on by the invasion of Ukraine.\nBan Ki-moon, now deputy chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and public figures, said countries faced stark choices as a result of the Ukraine war and energy crisis, and must embrace renewable energy instead of returning to fossil fuels.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous \u2013 just look at the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report,\u201d he said, referring to the latest warning from scientists last month. \u201cThere is no time for us to lose. Even under normal conditions [before the Ukraine war] we were far behind the pace.\u201d\nHe called on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to end the war. \u201cPresident Putin, if he is a man of global vision, or humanity, or compassion, he must stop. Whatever grievances he may have and concerns he may have, he can negotiate later rather than killing people.\u201d\nHe warned that the Ukraine war, as well as being \u201coutrageous in the 21st century\u201d, would have an impact on the climate crisis. Governments should not try to secure greater supplies of fossil fuels, he urged, as they sought alternatives to imports of Russian oil and gas, on which the EU, the US and the UK have now placed restrictions.\n\u201cThis [war] will impact the international community\u2019s effort to address climate issues, and the pandemic issues,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI am concerned that some European countries are even now considering how to address oil and energy shortages [by seeking] exports of some other [sources of] gas or oil. In the UK, there is some idea of releasing the ban on fracking. These are very short term, unproductive ideas.\u201d\nFracking in the UK would be \u201cnot a good idea\u201d, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s very short term gain that will lose the long term interest of humanity. I hope the politicians have some longer vision for the benefit of the whole world.\u201d\nThe UK government signalled this week that fracking was still a possibility, though an unlikely one. Ministers have come under pressure to back fracking, from some backbenchers and sections of the media, even though it is unlikely to be economically viable and would do nothing to ease the current crisis as it would take years to produce any gas.\nMeanwhile, the EU set out plans last week to cut dependency on Russian oil and gas by two-thirds by the end of this year. Some of the slack will be taken up by seeking other suppliers, such as shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and by an expansion of renewable energy and push for greater energy efficiency.\nBut expanding domestic fossil fuels, such as coal, may also be seen as a possibility if Vladimir Putin goes further and cuts off more supplies to Europe. Ban said that Germany, which has been phasing out coal, should not return to fossil fuels: \u201cGermany is the biggest economic power in Europe \u2013 they should not take this as a kind of short term political gain.\u201d\nBan also urged countries to consider nuclear energy, which he said would be a \u201cwise choice\u201d. He said: \u201cThere has been some debate and controversy on whether to use nuclear energy or not. But if we use a good energy mix, with renewable energy, nuclear energy and other clean sources of energy, that\u2019s the way we can meet the target of carbon neutrality \u2026 We have to use nuclear energy.\u201d\nThe war in Ukraine would affect preparations for Cop27, the next UN climate summit, set to take place in Egypt this November, he warned. \u201cThis is an issue for humanity and our planet Earth. This has nothing to do with politics,\u201d said Ban. \u201cBut in reality this may be affected [by the war in Ukraine].\u201d\nBan visited the UK on Friday to give a lecture at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and speak to Alok Sharma, the UK president of Cop26 who will continue to lead the UN negotiations until this November, but their meeting had to take place online because Sharma has contracted Covid-19.\nBan urged rich countries to prepare for Cop27 by providing more financial assistance to developing world governments to adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, such as extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises. \u201cWorld leaders should really feel a sense of global responsibility, global justice and global humanity, and a sense of compassion for those people [affected by climate breakdown],\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have to listen to the recommendations of the IPCC and the scientists. It\u2019s much more important than politics,\u201d he said.\nBan also said he was angry at countries\u2019 handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in its early stages, seeing a \u201clack of multilateralism\u201d in the approach countries took after the outbreak was confirmed. He was also scathing about the role of the World Bank in the pandemic, saying it had not done enough.\n\u201cThis is a serious issue, this is a lack of multilateralism. So I am, as a former secretary general, really angry that we should suffer like this, because the initial preventive measures have not been taken properly,\u201d he said.\n This article was amended on 14 March 2022 to locate Ban Ki-moon\u2019s lecture at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies rather than the University of Oxford.",

        "content": "Joe Root\u2019s continuation as England Test captain may be in part down to a lack of alternatives but as the team flew to Barbados on Saturday, their interim head coach, Paul Collingwood, spoke of a \u201creal unity\u201d being formed under the Yorkshireman.\nThese are early days in the post-Ashes rebuild and a drawn first Test against West Indies on a lifeless Antiguan pitch is not cause to bring out the bunting. Nevertheless, after an early wobble England were enterprising, energetic and batters banked some previously elusive runs with centuries for Root, Zak Crawley and Jonny Bairstow.\nCollingwood, holding the fort until a new director of cricket and head coach are appointed by the England and Wales Cricket Board, is modest about his own prospects for the second of those two vacancies. However, he sees a team playing for a captain who, though a record 62 Tests into the job, retains a strong desire to lead.\n\u201cYou can sense that he\u2019s got everybody behind him,\u201d Collingwood said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real unity. We\u2019ve got a direction, we\u2019ve got clarity, we were very honest with our conversations at the start of the tour and he looks as though he\u2019s enjoying his cricket.\n\u201cI really believe he can turn this team around. It\u2019d be great if this was the backbone for many years. They\u2019ve got the chance to be together for a lot of years and there are a lot of young players in there. I\u2019m sure Joe would love to be captain for that.\u201d\nThough eight players were dropped after the Ashes, the fact that two still merited retention on performance \u2013 Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad \u2013 has led some to speculate whether their presence somehow diminished Root\u2019s authority or the environment, either in the dressing room or out on the field. Collingwood looked to dismiss the notion: \u201cThat\u2019s really unfair to say that having those personalities there, Stuart and Jimmy, would make any difference.\n\u201cThe way [Root] has gone about his business right from ball one here in Antigua has been excellent. He\u2019s committed, he\u2019s determined, he\u2019s very hungry to turn things round. No matter the personalities in the team, he\u2019ll have that same attitude.\u201d\nThere is a quick turnaround before the second Test starts in Bridgetown on Wednesday but one change appears a given after Mark Wood\u2019s right elbow problem \u2013 described as \u201can impingement\u201d by Collingwood \u2013 materialised mid-match.\nCollingwood was more upbeat about Ollie Robinson\u2019s hopes of a return, with the 6ft 5in right-armer \u201cgetting the ball through really well\u201d out in the middle between sessions. The back spasms that ruled him out of the match \u2013 and dogged his previous outing in Hobart \u2013 mean further fitness tests are required this week.\nA seam attack of Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Ben Stokes and Wood that collectively sent down 139 overs for seven wickets at 47 runs apiece may require further refreshment, however. Saqib Mahmood and Matt Fisher, both of whom are uncapped, should also look to push their claims in the nets at the Kensington Oval.\nThe thunder of Stokes notwithstanding, Jack Leach was the pick in Antigua, sending down 34 maidens from his 73.4 overs and claiming five wickets. The left-armer\u2019s final tally might have been greater but for finding himself the wrong side of three umpire\u2019s calls and Root\u2019s failure to review an lbw shout against Jason Holder on the final day.\nCollingwood believes Leach is growing as a voice in the setup and, more broadly, wants the team to use Antigua as just the start. \u201cWe want to keep that as the benchmark,\u201d said the former all-rounder. \u201cOur fielding, our ground-fielding was superb, our energy, our fitness levels, that\u2019s a good sign of where a team is.\n\u201cThe boys kept plugging away. Great signs but it\u2019s 0-0 and we need to turn up in Barbados with the same attitude and character, and desire \u2013 all the things that win you Test matches. [With] that performance level, we\u2019ve given ourselves a good chance.\u201d\nAsked about the prospect of making his own role permanent, be it head coach or in charge of the white-ball setup if the role is split, Collingwood replied: \u201cThe simple fact is I haven\u2019t experience in either. But look at it that way [and] you\u2019ll never get a head coach role. I\u2019m just looking to get through these games, not thinking too far ahead.\u201d",

        "content": "Andriy Yarmolenko sank to his knees, arms out, less in celebration it seemed than in exhaustion. His teammates surrounded him, their reaction less of joy than of something more profound. When the Ukrainian got to his feet, his mouth was tight as he tried to fight back the tears. In the end he could not and, as he walked back to his own half to restart the game, he wept openly. Even Aston Villa\u2019s players applauded. Football can be a horrible sport, its ownership model perhaps addled beyond repair, but there are still times when it can provide moments of enormous poignancy and perhaps more.\n\u201cGoal for West Ham and Ukraine,\u201d boomed the stadium announcer, \u201cAndriy Yarmolenko.\u201d Was that overdoing it? Perhaps. But the bombast matched the mood. This was a goal that set West Ham on the way to their second win in seven games, and that kept West Ham dreaming of Champions League qualification. But it felt a lot more important than that.\nWhat by the end of the season will probably appear a mid-table clash is nothing but an irrelevance in the wider context, but perhaps somewhere, in some bunker in Mariupol, a shattered apartment block in Kyiv, or in Yarmolenko\u2019s home city of Chernihiv in the north of Ukraine, somebody will hear that Yarmolenko scored and be transported, at least momentarily, from the horror.\nAnd perhaps they will hear of the roar that greeted Yarmolenko\u2019s arrival as a 52nd-minute substitute for Michail Antonio, or of the scenes that followed his goal, and know that their plight is remembered, that the sympathy of a large part of the world is with them. It is only a symbol, but it is something.\nThe sense with West Ham recently has been of weariness, as they went out of the FA Cup to Southampton and lost the first leg of their Europa League tie at Sevilla. Antonio, in particular, has looked short of his usual zip. This was his 27th league start of the season but he has not scored in the league since New Year\u2019s Day.\nWest Ham have a long-standing habit of wasting money on centre-forwards but the failure to bring in support for him in January may be what ends up costing them Champions League football next season. There was one dart from the Jamaica striker after 33 minutes that brought a corner, but his involvement was spasmodic even before he went down with what appeared to be a groin problem.\nThis was a game littered with injuries. Villa\u2019s Lucas Digne hobbled off after 10 minutes and Aaron Cresswell followed Antonio. With Jarrod Bowen also out, West Ham are running short of attacking options. Yarmolenko may have a major role to play in the coming weeks. He took his goal well, seizing on Sa\u00efd Benrahma\u2019s pass before deftly clipping his shot past Emi Mart\u00ednez with the outside of his foot with 20 minutes remaining.\n\u201cSa\u00efd gave me the ball. In the box,\u201d said Yarmolenko. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of time and you need to do everything really quick and I was quick enough.\u201d Benrahma laid on the second for Pablo Fornals to cap a neat counter 12 minutes later.\nWhat was odd was how Villa, despite having won their previous three games, seemed happy to let the game drift. There were moments of low-key time-wasting and a lot of sideways passes. For a long time this was a very flat affair, although it did liven up around the hour mark as Danny Ings had a shot pushed against the post and then Craig Dawson headed over the bar from close range after Mart\u00ednez had made a remarkable block from a Kurt Zouma header.\nAs well as advancing two rounds in the FA Cup, West Ham reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup and are in the last 16 of the Europa League. If fatigue is beginning to take its toll, it\u2019s perhaps no great surprise. Just because West Ham won, nobody should think that issue has gone away. This was a tired performance, and the suspicion was that if Villa had gone at West Ham earlier as they belatedly did having fallen behind, they might have caused them problems. As it was, Jacob Ramsey\u2019s 90th-minute goal was enough only to cause West Ham an anxious six minutes of injury time.\nThe three points may prove important come the end of the season, but really the sense here was that what mattered was far less the result or any specifics, than the warmth that was shown to Yarmolenko. \u201cFor me, it is really important to feel the support from the manager and my team-mates and the fans. When I feel it, I give everything for the fans and the club.\u201d As the rockets fall on Ukraine it is next to nothing, a gesture of almost incalculable meagreness, but it is what football can do. And if that provides succour to anybody, then it is worth something.",

        "content": "In other news, Kai Havertz scored a stunning last-minute goal to give Chelsea a fifth Premier League win on the spin and hand Newcastle a first defeat in 10 in the competition.\nIt was a day when the action on the field felt strangely incidental, as Chelsea played at Stamford Bridge for the first time since the fall of their oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Facing them were opponents owned by the Public Investment Fund of a country that is involved in the war with Yemen and also one in which 81 men were executed on Saturday.\nOutgoing Russian money versus incoming Saudi Arabian money, with ethical questions everywhere. It was one to warm the hearts of the romantics.\nIt is fair to say that plenty has happened at Chelsea since their last game here \u2013 the Champions League last-16, first-leg win against Lille on 22 February. Abramovich has been identified by the UK government as an enabler of the Vladimir Putin regime and he has been stripped of his assets in this country, including Chelsea, which he must now sell. And with a degree of speed, if the stinging sanctions that are in place against the club are not to drag them under.\nThe match-going Chelsea support tried to process it all. Should they celebrate their affection for Abramovich? To some of them, it remains possible to do so and condemn his nation\u2019s senseless war on Ukraine.\nThe banner was still up inside the ground \u2013 the one that says \u201cRoman Empire\u201d and has an image of him \u2013 and yet there was only one chant of Abramovich\u2019s name that stood out in the 66th minute and it was quickly superseded by another for the manager, Thomas Tuchel, who really is the man in these parts.\nIt was edgy and uncomfortable, Chelsea labouring for much of the afternoon. And yet Havertz would provide something glorious at the very end. There were shades of Dennis Bergkamp about the way that he cushioned down a ball over the top from Jorginho and then, in the same movement and with the same foot, unloaded the finish past Martin Dubravka.\nHavertz could very well have been sent off for an elbow on Dan Burn towards the end of the first half. Now he was the hero and he might have had a second goal in stoppage time only to be denied when Dubravka pushed his effort up and on to the crossbar and away.\nNewcastle cursed their luck. Never mind the Havertz dismissal that was not, they were denied a penalty on 58 minutes when Jacob Murphy went down after a challenge from Trevoh Chalobah. Perhaps Murphy crumpled a little too obviously but Chalobah did have a hold of his shirt. Eddie Howe would rage about the decision, although he could be cheered by a performance of polish and discipline from his team.\nWhen Havertz\u2019s goal went in, Tuchel tore off on an ecstatic run along the touchline, the pent-up emotions pouring out and, briefly, everybody could forget about what a weird occasion it had been.\nThe trappings were everywhere. The Chelsea club shop remained closed, there was a sign saying that tickets were not available for the next home game against Brentford and the match-day programme, in which the captain, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, offered a message of support for the Ukrainian people, was not on general sale.\nThe Saudi Arabia flags in the away end were jarring after what had happened 24 hours previously \u2013 the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom in its modern history.\nTuchel\u2019s switch to a back four, with the centre-halves Chalobah and Malang Sarr in the full-back positions, was probably not the big news it might have been but, as the manager had stressed, Chelsea needed to narrow the focus and do their jobs on the pitch.\nTuchel has been hugely impressive in his public utterances, refusing to duck the difficult questions about the wider issues, to say what has needed to be said, and his attitude has been in stark contrast to the way that Howe essentially no-commented any non-football questions after the game. Perhaps, there was an element of liberation for Tuchel during the 90 minutes, when he could embrace the simple pleasure of losing the plot with the fourth official or the Newcastle assistant manager, Jason Tindall.\nHavertz left Burn with a nasty cut to the head on 39 minutes when he led with the elbow in an aerial challenge. It could easily have been red; instead Havertz got away with yellow. Burn was understandably angry and, while he received treatment on the ground, he seemed to slap Havertz on the ankle as the Chelsea attacker walked past. Once Burn was vertical, he went after Havertz, which attracted the interest of Antonio R\u00fcdiger. Burn, of course, would be booed by the home crowd.\nChelsea had continued to wear the branding of Three and Hyundai on their shirts, even though both sponsors have withdrawn their support. Apparently, the club worried that they could not pay for blank shirts from their kit supplier, Nike, and efforts to remove the logos from the existing tops did not work. All pretty surreal.\nNewcastle were the better team in the first half, Burn flicking a header just wide and Miguel Almir\u00f3n working \u00c9douard Mendy with a banging volley while their fans provided the note of humour. \u201cMike Ashley, he\u2019s coming for you,\u201d they warned their Chelsea counterparts, mindful that their unloved former owner could be looking for a new gig.\nTimo Werner\u2019s control let him down when he chased a high ball forward in the 56th minute and Havertz headed straight at Dubravka. It did not look as though it would be Chelsea\u2019s day. Havertz would turn it around.",

        "content": "As Les Bleus chase a first grand slam in 12 years, more questions than answers exist for France, England and Ireland\nAnd so the Six Nations has the last tango it wanted. A packed Stade de France and a primetime television audience, a grand slam up for grabs and enough pre-match talking points to wallpaper the Louvre. Can France be stopped? Are England capable of being party-poopers? Is there any chance of Ireland sneaking up on the blindside? Regardless of the answers, \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d will be lively.\nOn the evidence of the penultimate weekend\u2019s three games, France should be feeling quietly confident as they eye a first grand slam for 12 years.\nNo one could accuse them of playing the house down in Cardiff on Friday night but their Shaun Edwards-marshalled defence remained firm enough to deliver a fourth win in four championship games. The tournament\u2019s most improved defence versus a hitherto blunt-edged England attack? A mass outbreak of Covid or a fistful of red cards aside, a home win looks the likelier outcome.\nThere is, though, one key element no side in the competition has completely mastered as yet. How many teams, when the pressure of favouritism has materialised, have risen emphatically to it? Not Scotland, who lost in Cardiff when everyone expected them to win? Not France in Cardiff. And not Ireland, either, despite the late couple of tries that massaged the 32-15 Twickenham scoreline on Saturday.\nHad Ireland, as also happened against Italy, retained their poise more consistently and not endured such a horror show at the scrums, the admirable spirit in adversity shown by England\u2019s forwards would have sustained them for only so long. The psychology of it all is fascinating: not for the first time a side reduced to 14 men redoubled their efforts and made life awkward for a side that theoretically held all the aces.\nWhich is why all and sundry need to pause and await the acid test of a full-on Parisian finale before arriving at a verdict on Eddie Jones\u2019s continuing stewardship. We will never know what would have unfolded had Charlie Ewels stayed on the field \u2013 or James Ryan for that matter \u2013 but, equally, the lock\u2019s second-minute red card made it impossible to reach any hard and fast conclusions.\n15\tH Keenan Ireland 14 \tA Capuozzo Italy\n13 \tC Harris Scotland\n12 \tJ Danty France\n11 \tJ Lowe Ireland10 \tD Biggar Wales\n9\tJ Gibson-Park Ireland\n1\tE Genge England\n2\tJ Marchand France\n3\tT Francis Wales\n4\tM Itoje England\n5\tW Rowlands Wales\n6\tC Lawes England\n7\tJ van der Flier Ireland\n8\tT Faletau Wales\nThat is not to say England\u2019s attack is anywhere remotely close to where it needs to be. Take out the Italy game and the ledger shows a paltry two tries in three games, one donated by Wales via a lineout malfunction and the other via a little Murrayfield magic from Marcus Smith.\nThere is a continuing absence of top-level pace and, at times, much real shape behind the scrum.\nThe selectorial stubbornness of past seasons is also coming home to roost in some positions and another bottom-half finish to a Six Nations \u2013 potentially their third under Jones in five years \u2013 would be unacceptable for a side with England\u2019s pretensions. All that said, those actually on the field deserve genuine respect for the spirit, determination and defiance which inspired one of the noisier occasions Twickenham has hosted in a while.\nMaro Itoje, Ellis Genge, Jamie George, Courtney Lawes, Sam Simmonds and Jack Nowell displayed such staggering commitment that France, whose lineout stuttered in Cardiff, will need to be far more consistently dynamic than they were against Wales. The other undisputed area of English excellence was their kick chase: France\u2019s Melvyn Jaminet may be a superb goal-kicker and runner but, as Dan Biggar demonstrated, he can be fallible beneath the high ball. Do not be surprised if Ben Youngs is once again recalled.\nThere is a bigger picture, though, which will swiftly unveil itself to every England player when they embark a few days early to France this week as part of their forward planning for next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup. Pick up a copy of L\u2019\u00c9quipe with their morning coffee in the Parisian suburbs and the rising sense of French expectation will be unmissable, lacking only the final dessert spoon of cr\u00e8me anglaise on top.\nUnder Fabien Galthi\u00e9, Rapha\u00ebl Iba\u00f1ez and Edwards, Les Bleus have also visibly kicked on in the past two years in a way England simply have not. For Genge read Cyril Baille, for George read Julien Marchand, for Itoje read Cameron Woki. And if Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt and Antoine Dupont looked relatively mortal in Cardiff, the possibility of a grand slam in Paris will surely rejuvenate them.\nJones\u2019s counter-thrust is that his reshuffled England squad will also be peaking in 18 months\u2019 time but endless promises of la confiture demain will sound even hollower if his side come to a sticky end on Saturday. While the Rugby Football Union is loth to jettison Jones now, not least because of the expense and the shortage of available replacements, there is no question that a grim night in Paris would intensify the scrutiny on certain aspects of his tenure.\nWales and Ireland, by contrast, have shared three of the last four titles and the Irish last finished in the bottom half of a Six Nations in 2013. A final weekend victory in Dublin combined with a French loss in Paris could yet yield a fourth title in nine years, assuming they tighten up their basics, reduce their penalty count and stop trying to throw miracle offloads whenever they make a half break.\nIt is also necessary to go back to 2010 to find Scotland\u2019s most recent win in Dublin, which just happened to be the same year France last claimed the Six Nations title. On that occasion they sneaked home 12-10 against England in the concluding game thanks to three penalties from Morgan Parra and a drop goal from Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc, with Ben Foden contributing the game\u2019s only try on a damp evening. This time around the weather is set fair and the stage is perfectly set. Are France the real deal? We are about to find out.",

The current system has failed.With a target to reduce gambling harm in half by 2030. Our @SMFthinktank report\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc https://t.co/5moNlbJGkG\nCurrently, gambling companies make voluntary donations to the charity GambleAware, to fund a range of treatment services for people addicted to gambling. This voluntary deal will provide up to \u00a3100m over a four-year period.\nIn February, NHS England severed its links with GambleAware because of concerns over the group\u2019s connection to the gambling industry. Instead, the NHS will fully fund its own gambling services across England from 1 April.\nThe government is reviewing the UK\u2019s gambling laws, with proposals to be published in a white paper expected within weeks.\nDr James Noyes, a senior fellow at the SMF who co-authored the paper, said the government should take the opportunity to put the prevention and treatment of gambling harm under the leadership of the DHSC, funded through a proper statutory framework.\n\u201cIn 2020, a House of Lords select committee report stated that it is \u2018beyond belief\u2019 that DCMS has steadfastly refused to introduce a statutory levy on the gambling industry. Yet two years on, we have still not seen any progress,\u201d Dr Noyes said.\n\u201cThis is despite the fact that dozens of leading clinicians, academics and parliamentarians have called for an end to the current voluntary arrangement between DCMS, GambleAware and the gambling industry.\u201d",

        "content": "Exclusive: Victim\u2019s lawyer argues house failed to put in place sufficiently protective insurance policy\nA woman who was repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed by a former Labour MP is considering suing the House of Commons for failing to ringfence money that could cover her compensation.\nWoman A was victimised after spurning the advances of Mike Hill, the former MP for Hartlepool, an employment tribunal ruled in July. An ally of Jeremy Corbyn, he was found to have climbed into the victim\u2019s bed and sexually assaulted her in his parliamentary office.\nOn Thursday her barrister, Suzanne McKie QC, told a remedy hearing that nearly all of the \u00a3250,000 insurance policy that the Commons had put in place to cover an MP facing an employment claim had been spent on Hill\u2019s legal fees.\nMcKie told the hearing that the Commons bore responsibility for failing to keep some money for her client\u2019s legal costs and compensation.\n\u201cMs A now has to consider how to effect judgment against Mr Hill when there is almost nothing left in that pot of money, and whether to sue the House of Commons for failing to put in place a sufficiently protective policy,\u201d McKie told the hearing.\nWoman A, who spoke to the tribunal under oath, said: \u201cThe insurance policy which covers MPs\u2019 misconduct as employers is capped at \u00a3250,000, which includes defence costs as well as compensation for the victim. Mr Hill has deliberately pursued a hopeless case, reducing what\u2019s available to me to very little.\n\u201cThey had plenty of opportunity to settle this case, which was a hopeless case and which they knew they would not win. This has destroyed me, and they have taken four and a half years of my life, and I\u2019m left with nothing and no hope.\u201d\nIn July a central London tribunal found that Hill had marginalised Woman A in parliament, changed her terms and conditions of employment, and made her redundant after she rejected his advances.\nHill\u2019s case has been funded by the taxpayer because of an insurance policy offered to all MPs, while Ms A\u2019s has been funded in part through a crowdfunding campaign.\nMcKie, who is acting pro bono, told Thursday\u2019s hearing that MPs were covered by a \u00a35m insurance policy if they were sued for libel or slander, but by a \u00a3250,000 policy if an employee claimed sexual harassment.\nShe said: \u201cThe \u00a35m insurance policy for MPs does not apply to deliberate acts, which must include sexual harassment and misconduct. The alternative insurance policy which does apply, the employment practices policy, is capped at \u00a3250k and includes defence costs as well as any amount for compensation.\u201d\nThe fact that the policy does not ringfence money and can be exhausted on legal fees was raised by McKie, who implied that this could be a factor in other high-profile cases. \u201cThis is an important point, given matters aired in the press in the last few days related to misconduct in the House of Commons,\u201d she said.\nLast week an independent inquiry found that the former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow was a \u201cserial bully\u201d and liar, which could leave the Commons open to claims of compensation.\nThe hearing on Thursday was asked by Woman A\u2019s legal team to make a recommendation that the House of Commons in future provides insurance policies that ringfence compensation for victims of harassment, misconduct and sexual assault. This is so that most of the moneys within the policy are available for compensation and cannot be used up on the legal fees of the MP, the barrister said.\nHill, who was then married, conducted a campaign of sexual harassment and bullying against Woman A over a 16-month period in 2017 and 2018, according to a reserved judgment. He was in breach of the Equalities Act in subjecting the claimant \u201cto unwanted conduct of a sexual nature\u201d.\nThe breaches included a telephone call on the evening of 22 September 2017 in which he told the claimant he loved her; \u201cgetting into bed with the claimant on 11 December 2017 and rubbing his erection against her\u201d; and \u201csexual assaults on occasions at the Westminster office\u201d.\nHe was also found to have victimised her with behaviour that included deactivating her security pass, ignoring her work-related text and emails, and terminating the claimant\u2019s employment while stating he would put notice on the flat they shared in a text message.\nHill resigned as a Labour MP in March 2021, resulting in a May byelection in Hartlepool and a victory for the Conservatives.\nThe remedies judgment was reserved on Friday.\nA House of Commons spokesperson said: \u201cThe House of Commons covers the cost of liability insurance to cover members for claims made against them by employees. Providing a single policy covering all MPs is more cost-effective to the taxpayer. How any claim is resolved would be a matter for the insurer and we cannot comment on individual cases.\u201d",

On election night, I felt he was going to lose. And I was actually surprised it was as close as it was.\u201d\nBiden beat Trump by more than 7m ballots in the popular vote and by 306-232 in the electoral college \u2013 a margin Trump called a landslide when it was in his favour over Hillary Clinton in 2016.",

        "content": "Witnesses describe soldiers shooting people dead in the street and confiscating phones and laptops\nRussian soldiers have shot people dead in the street as they took over Ukrainian villages, according to fleeing residents.\nSoldiers shot randomly at buildings, threw grenades down roads and went from house to house confiscating phones and laptops, witnesses said.\nOnline groups created for family members or friends looking for information about people in affected areas are receiving hundreds or even thousands of requests a day.\nOne witness, Mykola, described how soldiers arrived in Andriivka, a village near Kyiv. \u201cThey threw grenades down the street. One man lost his leg and the next day this person died,\u201d he said. \u201cThey then came down the central street and started shooting at the windows and hit one woman. Her children managed to hide.\u201d\nMykola lived within walking distance of his brother, Dymtro. \u201cMy brother came out the house with his hands in the air. They beat him and then executed him in the street,\u201d he said.\nDymtro\u2019s wife said she saw the killing of her husband from a window. She said she also witnessed their neighbour being killed in the same manner. Dymtro\u2019s daughter believes both were shot because they had earlier helped the Ukrainian army as volunteers.\nMykola said they wanted to bury his brother, but his wife feared the soldiers would shoot them. \u201cThe next day they went house by house, confiscating phones and laptops,\u201d he said. At this point, 3 March, there was no electricity. \u201cThose who came into our house behaved OK. But they told us that it\u2019s good you have a cellar, collect some water, because you\u2019re going to be bombed for six days.\u201d\nThe Russians would not let them bury Dymtro in the graveyard, so they buried him in the garden. Dymtro\u2019s daughter, Yulia, said that soon afterwards a mortar attack began and the neighbouring house started to burn. A Russian soldier told them to wait behind their tank because it was safer, she said. \u201cWe were terrified. We didn\u2019t understand whether it was Russians shooting or our guys. Everything after that was a blur. We ran home and barely made it under constant mortar attack.\u201d\nOn 8 March, Mykola, his family and Dymtro\u2019s family decided to leave, as they had no phone signal and no electricity. Dymtro\u2019s wife approached the soldiers to ask for permission, but the soldiers starting shooting in the air. Mortar attacks were also ongoing, so the family decided to leave without permission.\n\u201cAs we were leaving, they were shooting at our car, even though we had [the word] \u2018children\u2019 written on bits of paper in the windows. But evidently they weren\u2019t particularly interested in that fact,\u201d said Yulia.\nThe father of a family that left with Mykola\u2019s group was shot at when a soldier saw him calling someone from his garden, Yulia said. \u201cHow can you understand that people could be killed just for ringing their relatives to say that they\u2019re alive?\u201d\nWhen the Russians entered Druzhnya, another village near Kyiv, they shot at the houses, according to Serhiy, who has since fled his home. \u201cI think they did this so that they weren\u2019t attacked with molotov cocktails,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo all of those houses along the main road from Bordyanka to Makariv were hit and some people died. Then they started to go house by house. They killed a teacher who was outside feeding her chickens,\u201d Serhiy said.\n\u201cThey told people not to go outside and to stay at home.\u201d Serhiy said the soldiers told him: \u201cIf you see us, don\u2019t make any sudden moves, put your hands above your head.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no connection, we still have relatives there and we cannot contact them. They took some people\u2019s phones, and they temporarily took other people\u2019s phones to check that they hadn\u2019t photographed anything or filmed anything.\u201d\nOn 10 March the Russians agreed to a facilitate a humanitarian corridor to evacuate residents from Borodyanka and the neighbouring villages. According to Serhiy, the bombing was even heavier that day. Serhiy\u2019s brother-in-law cycled along a forest dirt road to check if it was clear of Russians, which it was. The family then drove out through the forest.\nOne Telegram group for relatives searching for people still in the affected areas, run by a well-known Ukrainian TV presenter, has had more than 60,000 inquiries since it launched on 26 February, and now receives about 1,000 new requests a day.\nCommunity Facebook groups for the affected areas are full of hundreds of desperate appeals from relatives, hoping that someone in the area might have signal and be able to tell them if their loved ones are still alive.\nValeriy, 34, HR professional who lived in Kyiv, was at his country house in the village of Lypivka when the war started. After the Russians moved into a neighbouring town, he started receiving messages on a community group from relatives of people in the town who were no longer able to reach their family members.\n\u201cThe messages were like: \u2018Please help me find Ivan Ivanovych,\u2019 with a photograph and address. And the number of messages just built and built, and I became scared,\u201d Valeriy said. \u201cThen started to come information that they were destroying the multi-storey buildings in Borodyanka with people in them using tanks.\u201d\nFrom 1 March there was no phone signal or electricity but there was some patchy signal in the fields, he said. \u201cEither they somehow blocked the signal, or it was because of the lack of electricity.\u201d He managed to escape under shelling on 3 March.\n*Names have been changed.",

        "content": "Thomas Tuchel said he would not quit before the end of the season after Chelsea put their uncertain situation to one side and beat Newcastle United thanks to a brilliant goal from Kai Havertz.\nChelsea are in a state of limbo after the UK government imposed sanctions on Roman Abramovich and they risk falling into major financial difficulties after being granted a special licence to continue operating. However there is optimism that a sale could go through soon, with potential bidders given until Friday to submit proposals, and interested parties will no doubt be encouraged to hear that Tuchel has no plans to leave at the moment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I stay until the end of the season,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cWe just have to wait day by day because everything can change. The club is for sale but hopefully it goes through. So day by day, which is a good way to live your life. There are circumstances we can\u2019t influence but that gives us the freedom to focus on the things we can influence.\n\u201cThe focus is on the first team, our players and me. But Chelsea is much more than just the first team. It is a massive club with huge tradition and there are hundreds of staff \u2013 it\u2019s not just the players \u2013 and it\u2019s important we show the spirit and give them the distraction.\u201d\nTuchel was asked whether he found it strange that Chelsea have been targeted because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine while there has been relatively little attention on Newcastle, who are owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. It was announced on Saturday that 81 people were executed in the previous 24 hours in Saudi Arabia, who are also waging war in Yemen.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big question,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cUnfortunately, the situation is like this for the owners of Newcastle. What can I say? I don\u2019t want to point the finger because comparing yourself and blaming others doesn\u2019t change our situation. Our statement that we condemn war and what happens in Ukraine doesn\u2019t change. There is no doubt.\n\u201cAt some point we have to trust the process, the process of the league to control who owns a club. We are only employees and need to trust the process. Like you need to trust the process when you work for a company doing ethically and morally wrong things. Sometimes we need to ask questions of the process, how this goes; it\u2019s maybe an ongoing process and it will never end and just reminds us to be aware and conscious about it and not look away.\u201d\nEddie Howe was asked about the executions and Newcastle fans brandishing Saudi Arabia flags on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m just going to stick to football,\u201d Newcastle\u2019s manager said. \u201cI\u2019m still bitterly disappointed about the result.\u201d\nThe impact of the sanctions on Abramovich were obvious here. No programmes were on sale, the club shop was shut and the atmosphere inside and outside the ground often felt subdued. Chelsea have appealed to the government to ease further the terms of the licence.\nThe technical adviser, Petr Cech, said immediate aim was to ensure Chelsea finish the season and pay staff. \u201cHopefully the situation will be clearer soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope the people working for the club will be able to get their salaries.\u201d\nChelsea play at Lille in the Champions League on Wednesday and Tuchel said: \u201cMy last information is that we have a plane, that we can go by plane and come back by plane. If not we go by train, if not we go by bus \u2013 if not, I drive a seven-seater! And I will do. Mark my words I will do.\u201d\nThe British property tycoon Nick Candy has vowed to put a fan representative on the board if his bid to buy Chelsea succeeds.\n\u201cShould his bid be successful, Mr Candy would advocate for a fan representative to join the board so supporters become part of the decision-making process,\u201d a spokesperson for Candy said. A spokesperson for him also said: \u201cIf the club requires money to operate in the short term, Mr Candy would be happy to help ensure it has the necessary financial resources, subject to government approval.\u201d\nA consortium headed by Todd Boehly, Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein are the frontrunners to buy the club. A bid is also expected from Saudi Media.",

        "content": "Analysis: proximity to Nato border may appear unnerving but steps have been taken to reinforce air defences\nRussia\u2019s deadly multiple missile strike on Ukraine\u2019s military base in Yavoriv, less than 15 miles from the border with Poland, was clearly designed to send a message.\nNot only can Russian forces strike the western limits of Ukraine, killing at least 35 people near where western arms will be crossing into the country, but the Kremlin does not care if US or other volunteer fighters were training there.\nA day earlier, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov had said its military would treat arms shipments to Ukraine from Nato countries as \u201clegitimate targets\u201d.\nThe facility, well known as a location where Nato forces trained Ukrainians in years before the war began, is near the most direct route between Rzeszow airport, where western arms are being flown in, and the city of Lviv.\nIt is a place where foreign volunteers are said to have congregated as they start training with Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. But even if the base is not used or heavily used for either purpose, it is a site long viewed with suspicion by Russia.\nYet there are important limits to the Russian attack. While the proximity of lethal missile strikes to Nato borders may appear unnerving, the US and other allies have taken steps to reinforce and protect Poland\u2019s air defences.\nThe US vice-president, Kamala Harris, announced at the end of last week that two US Patriot missile batteries had been moved into Poland, stationed at Rzeszow. British military sources say a companion, the medium-range Sky Sabre system, already in the country after recent exercises, may be positioned alongside them soon.\nDespite Rybakov\u2019s rhetoric, a direct Russian attack on a Nato country, with its defences recently reinforced, would be unlikely in any circumstances, but particularly so given how Moscow\u2019s forces are struggling, losing men and materiel in their attack on Ukraine.\nNevertheless, the presence of the Patriot batteries is designed to reassure that it will be possible to intercept any stray missiles entering Polish airspace as the Russian offensive against Ukraine gets closer to the west of the country.\nRomania, another Nato country bordering Ukraine, already has its own Patriot system, while Germany and the Netherlands said a few days ago they would reposition one of their own in another border country, Slovakia.\nAs for the supply of western arms to Ukraine, experts believe it is unlikely to be constrained by a single attack, even one as deadly as that of Sunday morning. The Polish-Ukrainian border is more than 300 miles long, and steps are being taken to conceal the vital supplies as they cross into the country and beyond.\nIt is not realistically possible to cut off or interdict the movement of arms with periodic airstrikes because the territory is too vast. To do so is only practical where Moscow\u2019s forces dominate an area. For now, Russian ground troops, focused on Kyiv and the cities of east, are a long way from Lviv and the western border.\nNick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist at the Rusi thinktank, said: \u201c[Vladimir] Putin will struggle to interdict supplies into western Ukraine, but stands a much better chance of eventually encircling and thus cutting off Kyiv, as well as potentially cutting off crossings along the Dnieper River. But this will take time.\u201d\nRussia\u2019s dominance of the skies, particularly at night, will mean it is likely to engage in more missile attacks and show again it can strike in the west. But these do not in themselves dramatically alter the balance of the war, which is already deadly enough.",

        "content": "Analysis: Disputes with Biden administration mean Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are likely to drive hard bargain\nJoe Biden\u2019s hardline stance on Russia has won him widespread plaudits, but with the most serious oil shock in decades now a reality, the US president\u2019s attempt to cushion the blowback continues to meet resistance from the two allies he needs most.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, and his counterpart in the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed, are yet to agree to a phone call with the west\u2019s most powerful man \u2013 a scenario all but unthinkable during previous administrations.\nBiden\u2019s immediate priority is for both countries to help exert maximum economic pressure on Russia by cranking up their oil output. Each capital is a major supplier of oil, with excess capacity, which would soften the effect on US consumers through fuel prices before midterm elections in November that threaten Democratic control of Congress.\nWith relations between the Middle East oil powers and Washington at their lowest ebb in modern times, though, a reckoning is due that may realign the regional order on terms that favour Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Both leaders have made it clear that they will settle for nothing less, and are ready to extract their price.\nAs if to show the Biden administration what it could do, the UAE ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, last Wednesday said it favoured production increases \u201cand will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels\u201d, leading oil prices to fall by 13% the next day. But no action to increase supply followed and by the week\u2019s end the price per barrel was back up to almost $130 (\u00a3100), an uncomfortably high level for Biden to take to the midterms.\nHowever, the standoff involves far more than oil. In Riyadh, Prince Mohammed feels snubbed by Biden\u2019s refusal to engage with him ever since he took office. The murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by the crown prince\u2019s security aides, the war on Yemen, the jailing of rights activists and the boycott of Qatar have made him a pariah to the administration.\nDisputes with Abu Dhabi are nearly as stark. The US has been particularly taken aback by UAE\u2019s repeated abstentions in the UN security council, which have been seen by western diplomats in New York as a quid pro quo for Russian support of some of the anti-Houthi positions it wanted the council to take over the war in Yemen.\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have been incensed by the Biden administration removing the Iran-backed Houthis from the global terror list as they continue a painstaking series of negotiations with Iran to restart the Obama-era nuclear deal shredded by Donald Trump.\nBeyond that, though, there is a strong feeling in both capitals that Biden has approached the region with a deeply critical view of countries that had long been security allies, and lenient on Iran, which remains a foe.\nHaving attempted last week to recruit Venezuela to the cause of isolating Russia, the White House views efforts at repair work on the relationship with Saudi Arabia and the UAE as an acceptable price to pay.\nThe administration in February sent Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for Middle East policy, and Amos Hochstein, the state department\u2019s special energy envoy, to Riyadh for a meeting with the crown prince. On the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury announced sanctions on an alleged Houthi financing network.\nSir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador to Riyadh and a senior fellow at the UK thinktank Policy Exchange, said ties that had been growing between Riyadh and Moscow, particularly since Biden sidelined Prince Mohammed, would probably need to be recalibrated if a reset was to take place.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make a one-way bet on Putin myself. But that\u2019s how the Saudi position in particular will look to many in DC. That will just piss people off. And tempt them in turn to bet on Iran instead. You have to deal with [Prince Mohammed]. But if he demands a complete climbdown from Biden, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get it.\n\u201cThere has to be some way of squaring this circle. A renewed US promise to defend KSA [Saudi Arabia] and the UAE from Iran is one way. Redesignation of the Houthis and a renewed commitment to settling Yemen in a way that would suit Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is another. But I can\u2019t see Biden saying he\u2019s simply going to forget Khashoggi.\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think Russia matters that much to KSA. China\u2019s far more important. Beijing wants to avoid a collapse of global trade \u2013 or a prolonged western recession. And there are signs Beijing is trying to position itself appropriately. The risk then is that a hard line from Riyadh will just backfire.\u201d\nRobin Mills, the CEO of the UAE-based consultancy Qamar Energy, said increasing oil supply, and therefore reducing prices at the bowser, was a relatively straightforward technical process, but carried political and economic risk in dealings with the global oil body Opec, of which Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are members.\n\u201cThey could ramp up supply within one month and reach full capacity within 90 days,\u201d he said. \u201cOpening chokes on wells, restarting wells entirely, perhaps restarting gathering and production stations.\n\u201cEveryone has always cheated on Opec agreements when it suited them. Can you do it quickly? Not tomorrow, certainly. But unless something\u2019s gone seriously wrong, KSA should be able to make a three-month difference. That in itself would help \u2013 to a degree \u2013 in calming oil markets.\u201d",

He died peacefully, among family, of natural causes.\u201d Variety said that a family friend confirmed the news.\nHurt won the best actor Oscar in 1986 for Kiss of the Spider Woman, in which he had played a gay man who shares a cell with a with a political prisoner in Brazil. He received further Oscar nominations for best actor for Children of a Lesser God and Broadcast News, and for best supporting actor for A History of Violence.\nBorn in 1950, Hurt studied theology at university but turned to acting and enrolled at the Juilliard school in 1972. After a series of stage roles, he won his first major film role in the Ken Russell body horror film Altered States, which was swiftly followed by the then-sensational erotic thriller Body Heat, in which he starred opposite Kathleen Turner. Body Heat\u2019s notoriety made his name, and Hurt became a major star of the 1980s. He featured in a prominent role in the ensemble comedy drama The Big Chill, and the spy thriller Gorky Park, and was then cast in Kiss of the Spider Woman by director H\u00e9ctor Babenco.\nHurt would make a sensational success of the role, in which he played the drag-queen cellmate of Raul Julia\u2019s leftist revolutionary, winning the best actor award at Cannes as well as the best actor Oscar. The following year, he played a teacher in Children of a Lesser God, opposite Marlee Matlin (later his partner) who would go on to be the first deaf winner of an acting Oscar. In 1988 he made it three Oscar nominations in a row, for his role as a TV reporter in Broadcast News.\nIn the 1990s, successful roles appeared elusive; among others, mostly with an arthouse bent, he was in Wim Wenders\u2019 mammoth but disappointing Until the End of the World, Chantal Akerman\u2019s A Couch in New York, and the Carl Franklin-directed One True Thing. In 2005 he had an unexpected success with an atypical role, crime boss Richie Cusack in David Cronenberg\u2019s A History of Violence, which garnered him another Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. Three years later, he made possibly an even more unexpected entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing General Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross, a role he would repeat in Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, and Black Widow.\nIn 2009, Matlin published a memoir in which she described physical and emotional abuse by Hurt during their relationship. Hurt said later: \u201cI did and do apologise for any pain I caused.\u201d\nHurt was married twice, to Mary Beth Hurt from 1971 to 1982 and Heidi Henderson from 1989 to 1992. He also had high-profile relationships with Matlin, Sandra Jennings and Sandrine Bonnaire.",

        "content": "Eddie Jones\u2019s side deserve credit for battling with 14 men, but they are still chasing the elusive promise of their own potential\nIn England\u2019s national sporting psyche there is a special place reserved for the gallant loser. At times it can feel a little schmaltzy, a touch indulgent. To be beaten but unbowed is a romantic notion though one that can also suggest a certain nobility when the cold, hard facts point to a definitive defeat.\nLeaving a frazzled Twickenham late on Saturday night you could not help but wonder whether the heroic nature of such a defeat was overblown or if the plaudits heading England\u2019s way were justified after resisting Ireland for so long with 14 men, before two late tries broke their spirit. Maybe Ellis Genge summed it up best when writing on social media: \u201cNot a fan of the old brave losers vibe but I think circumstances probably warrant that.\u201d\nPart of the problem is that this was supposed to be a defining match for Eddie Jones\u2019s New England project. Victory would have kept them in the hunt for the Six Nations title, defeat would put them out of contention and clamours for Jones to go would resurface. It is one of the vagaries of sport that England suffered their heaviest ever Twickenham loss under Jones and their biggest margin of defeat by Ireland at home, yet emerge from it in considerable credit.\nMuch of that credit is warranted, but England did not show us a great deal we did not already know. They displayed character, resilience and heart by the bucketload but should they not be prerequisites at this level? Maro Itoje and Genge stiffened the sinews and summoned up the blood, but the former would walk into any Test side in the world and the latter has slowly but surely been developing into one of England\u2019s most consistent players this season. Clearly there is a togetherness about this side but that has been evident for a while now.\nIt should also be noted that while Charlie Ewels\u2019 red card was unprecedented in how early it arrived \u2013 and the premature departures of Tom Curry and Kyle Sinckler through injury compounded matters \u2013 matches have been won by teams going down to 14 men before. Only last year Ireland lost Peter O\u2019Mahony to a red card after only14 minutes in Cardiff, claimed a losing bonus point and had Wales clinging on at the death. England, however, never looked like scoring a try. They have managed only seven in four matches and Marcus Smith has ended with all their points in two of them.\nJones suggested afterwards that his side\u2019s performance will bode well for next year\u2019s World Cup, but there is a fair chance England will finish the Six Nations in fifth place again. Repeating their showing in Paris would certainly help but reaching emotional intensity like that in consecutive weeks is no easy feat and as Jones acknowledged afterwards: \u201cIf we had the secret potion for that, we\u2019d use it all the time,\u201d before adding: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got good spirit you can find it. No one knows the limits of human endeavour, so we intend to find it.\u201d\nDefeat against the grand\u2011slam chasing French would mean England again finish the tournament with just two victories, one of which was against Italy, and the ledger will not record their character or resilience on Saturday \u2013 the history books will record only a 17-point defeat at home. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken massive steps forward,\u201d insisted Jones. \u201cI can\u2019t see how we haven\u2019t progressed the way we want to progress. Obviously our aim was to win the championship.\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed we haven\u2019t won the championship, but sometimes circumstances mean that maybe the results don\u2019t mimic the performance. But that certainly catches up \u2013 the results will catch up.\u201d\nAs much as Jones talks of progression, he billed this as a semi-final and talked of how Ireland would be met with a wave of physicality they had not seen before. Perhaps Ewels was a little too fired up as a result. \u201cIn 18 months\u2019 time, if the same circumstances were to happen in the game, would we lose in the last 15 minutes or would we be able to carry it through for the whole 80?\u201d wondered Itoje, but it would be hard to see anything but another England defeat given how deep they dug in vain on Saturday.\nUltimately, there remain question marks around this side, a sense that the potential is there but an uncertainty as to whether it will be realised. The scrum dominance is an obvious positive but Jones says he wants to marry an old-fashioned England pack with a new-look attack and, though there were mitigating circumstances, certainly the latter was not on show against Ireland.\nMaybe, though, this was one of those occasions that does not need to be put into context. Twickenham built to a climax last November when South Africa were in town but the roof was raised on Saturday. That Itoje\u2019s kick-chase and subsequent flattening of Johnny Sexton produced the loudest cheer of the night only goes to show that this was no ordinary contest. It seems remarkable to think that, only 12 months ago, these matches were being played out in empty stadiums.\nThe inquest into another trophyless Six Nations for England is on hold for a week but they contributed to sporting theatre in its purest form. For now, that is something to celebrate.",

The author of Cherry Jezebel, a high-velocity comedy about after-hours queer culture, combines the brutal language of a working-class underdog with a heart as big as Liverpool.\nHis is a voice that is black to the point of cruelty, yet also compassionate. It would be camp if it were not so vicious; sentimental if it were not so funny. He gets laughs from cancer and suicide, but reserves his real anger for a world that is violently intolerant of those who wander from the heterosexual norm.\nIt starts in the ladies loos of a city-centre gay bar, like a gender-fluid Stags and Hens, the Russell comedy that premiered here at the Everyman in 1978. Mickey Jones as Cherry Brandy is a drag queen celebrating winning the MerseyPride Icon award. Preening and self-indulgent, she lauds it over best friend Heidi Handjob (Mariah Louca) while firing off scatter-gun put-downs of newcomer Pearl Reckless (Stefan Race) and token straight guy Mo (George Jones).\nIn James Baker\u2019s production, the cast are all bravado and invective, laying into each other with an unyielding sense of pace. No joke goes by without being topped by another more merciless, still. No cutting comment goes unreturned, barbed and primed to hurt.\nYet, however pummelling their delivery, it is a front. Whether gay, transgender, non-binary or just curious, they use attack as the best form of defence. Behind the facade, they are as vulnerable as anyone, whether damaged by the rejection of their families or physically abused by insecure lovers.\nAs the simple impressionism of Ellie Light\u2019s bathroom set switches to the cluttered realism of Cherry\u2019s front room (the upstairs bedroom is an unwieldy distraction), we enter a long, darkly comic night of the soul. Larkin writes angrily about the violence meted out to his characters, but he is also withering about their shortcomings. Cherry, in particular, is too narcissistic to be a true friend, her affections as superficial as the wig she discards.\nYet for all the bleakness, the play remains uplifting, as if there is nothing a chorus of Set You Free can\u2019t cure.\n At Everyman, Liverpool, until 26 March.",

In its latest monthly lettings index, Hamptons said this strong growth led to the average household in Great Britain spending 42% of their post-tax income on rent in 2021 \u2013 the highest proportion since its records began in 2010.\nWhen other costs such as gas, electricity, council tax, broadband and a TV licence were included, it meant a typical household spent 52% of their post-tax income on rent and bills in 2021.\nThis figure is set to climb further as the cost of living crisis deepens. By the end of this year, Hamptons predicts that the average rented household will be spending a record 54% of their post-tax income on rent and bills.\nThis will typically cost them an extra \u00a31,008 this year alone, with their total outlay set to rise to \u00a317,914 \u2013 up from \u00a316,906 in 2021. The 2022 figure includes an estimated \u00a34,015 for household bills, compared with \u00a33,350 in 2021.\nPrivate rents are still rising, with the new report putting the average monthly cost of a newly let property in Great Britain at \u00a31,118 in February. That was 6.7% or \u00a370 higher than 12 months earlier.\nThe annual rate of rental growth has gradually been coming down over the past few months \u2013 in July 2021 it was running at 8.7% \u2013 and Hamptons expects it to slow to about 2.5% by the end of this year.\nHowever, the latest national figure disguises wide regional variations. In south-east England and outer London, average rents are 1.5% to 3% higher than a year ago, and in the south-west they are up by 13%.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, some tenants quit London and other big cities after deciding they wanted to live in the suburbs, the countryside or near the sea. Others are planning to do so.\nAneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons, said: \u201cFinancial pressures are raining down on households but while last year it was rental growth that ate into tenants\u2019 incomes, this year it\u2019s more likely to be energy costs.\u201d\nShe said that with more income tied up in essentials, it was likely that discretionary spending was set to fall later this year, which she noted was \u201cbad news for the wider economy\u201d.",

They will provide the generators from their stocks, with many expected to be delivered via neighbouring countries. In total, they should provide enough power for 20,000 homes or equivalent buildings.\nThe prime minister said: \u201cWe are seeing the tragic consequences in Ukraine from [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s grave mistake every day, and we will continue to do everything we can to support Ukraine\u2019s resistance against this illegal invasion through economic, diplomatic and humanitarian measures, as well as providing defensive military equipment.\n\u201cWe will now be sending generators to ease the difficulties caused by the current power outages and help keep vital services running so the people of Ukraine can continue to defend their country.\u201d\nThe government said the plan emerged from recent discussions held between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, Johnson and the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.\nKwarteng said: \u201cSending portable electricity generators to Ukraine will help keep essential services running, weaken Putin\u2019s attempts to cripple Ukraine\u2019s power supply, and help support the extraordinarily brave Ukrainian response to the Kremlin\u2019s war waging.\u201d\nZelenskiy made a powerful address to MPs by video link to the House of Commons last week, citing Shakespeare and Churchill. He urged the government to ramp up sanctions against Russia and back a no-fly zone over his country.\n\u201cPlease increase the pressure of sanctions against this country [Russia] and please recognise this country as a terrorist country. Please make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe. Please make sure that you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country,\u201d he said.\nHowever, the UK, in common with the EU and US, has rejected the idea of a no-fly zone for fear that it could spark a direct military conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\nInstead, the UK has continued to provide military equipment to Ukrainian forces. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said last week that it would include Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons and Javelin anti-tank missiles.\nThe levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, said on Sunday that Putin had \u201cshown a level of ruthlessness beyond that which any other leader on Earth is capable of at the moment,\u201d warning what had happened in Aleppo, Syria, offered \u201cterrifying portents\u201d.\nJohnson said last week that Putin may be willing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said on Sunday that any response to such an attack would have to be agreed with Nato.\n\u201cThere is always a chilling risk of escalation that none of us want to see. I think in the middle of a conflict like this we shouldn\u2019t be speculating the what ifs,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cWe have to work in lockstep with our Nato allies, responding as things develop, but at this stage discussing what if, I don\u2019t think is helpful in a conflict like this.\u201d",

That time will come. But it\u2019s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I\u2019m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business LFG pic.twitter.com/U0yhRKVKVm\nBrady\u2019s return is not a complete surprise. A week after he initially announced his retirement in February, he said: \u201cI\u2019m just gonna take things as they come. I think that\u2019s the best way to put it and I don\u2019t think anything, you know, you never say never.\u201d\nHe also maintained close links with the Buccaneers and, in an Instagram story on Saturday, he was asked by Cristiano Ronaldo if he was sure his career was over. Brady\u2019s response could not be heard but the expression on his face suggested a return could be on the cards.\nThe 44-year-old Brady showed few signs that age had affected him last season. He led the NFL in yards passing (5,316), touchdowns (43), completions (485) and attempts (719) in 2021, but the Buccaneers lost at home to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round. The Bucs should still win a weak NFC South next season, although that could change if the Carolina Panthers seal a trade for three-time Pro Bowl quarterback Deshaun Watson, whose immediate future is under question due to legal problems.\nHowever, the biggest obstacle to Brady next season may be from within his own team. The Buccaneers are $11m over the salary cap and key players such as Rob Gronkowski, Leonard Fournette and Ndamukong Suh are all set to become free-agents. Perhaps more importantly, the offensive line that protected Brady so well during his time in Tampa could be severely weakened. Pro Bowl left guard Ali Marpet announced his retirement at the age of 28 last month, while center Ryan Jensen and right guard Alex Cappa are about to enter free agency.\nBrady\u2019s announcement comes at the end of a week in which the NFL has managed to dominate the US sports discourse, even in the league\u2019s offseason. On Tuesday, the reigning NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers confirmed he is staying with the Green Bay Packers while another star quarterback, Russell Wilson, left the Seattle Seahawks for the Denver Broncos in a blockbuster trade.\nOne person who will not welcome Sunday\u2019s news is the collector who paid $518,000 on Saturday for the ball that had been thrown for the last-ever touchdown pass of Brady\u2019s career on 23 January. One day later it turns out that the ball was merely Brady\u2019s last touchdown pass of the 2021 season.",

I had already heard it, but I was called that term by him in a phone call on or about 4 April 2018.\u201d\nRobert Setter has released a statement to say he was \u201cappalled and saddened\u201d by the claim.\n\u201cI am appalled because it is not behaviour that I consider appropriate \u2013 ever,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\u201cI deny absolutely making any misogynistic comments to or about the integrity commissioner at any time.\n\u201cI am saddened because the integrity commissioner has felt it necessary to use parliamentary privilege to raise her concern in this way.\n\u201cThe commissioner has never raised this with me directly. Nor am I aware that the commissioner has referred her concerns to any other authority.\u201d\nStepanov announced her resignation in January, sparking a much-hyped integrity saga within the Queensland public service.\nStepanov \u2013 whose office regulates lobbying in Queensland \u2013 has previously raised concerns about interference with her office by the Public Service Commission (PSC), which controls her agency\u2019s budget and staffing.\nThose concerns include allegations the PSC removed and wiped the contents of a laptop used by an employee, and complaints that the PSC had gradually stripped resources and key staff from the integrity commissioner\u2019s office.\nThe state parliament\u2019s economic and governance committee is holding hearings about a strategic review of the integrity commissioner\u2019s office. Stepanov gave evidence on Monday morning.\nShe said she had written to the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and would remain in her role until at least 31 December \u2013 extending her tenure in order to oversee reforms.\nSetter has previously denied suggestions he was uncooperative with Stepanov\u2019s attempts to conduct a lobbying audit of the PSC.\nThe integrity commissioner is an independent statutory office whose responsibility is to advise MPs and public servants on ethics matters, and to regulate lobbying activities.\nThe PSC is a central government agency assisting departments with managing their workforce.\nStepanov reiterated her support for a potential commission of inquiry into the integrity matters and argued that the integrity commissioner\u2019s office should be separated from the PSC. She said she should ultimately be given control of her own office\u2019s staffing and budget.\n\u201cWhere I have encountered concerns about conduct, the staff within the office are PSC staff,\u201d she told the committee.\n\u201cYou are seeking to do your job in an environment where you don\u2019t, in effect, control the resources that support you.\u201d\nStepanov had previously raised concerns about the way a PSC staff member, who had been working in her office, had handled confidential documents. She requested a forensic examination of the employee\u2019s laptop.\nIn March 2021, the PSC removed and allegedly wiped the contents of a laptop.\nThe Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission is investigating a complaint related to the deletion of files from the laptop.\nSetter\u2019s statement also addressed the broader public sector power struggle between the two offices.\n\u201cIt is a matter of public record that as the employer of staff in the office of the integrity commissioner, that I have been concerned for some time about allegations raised regarding the psychological safety of some staff.\n\u201cWhere there are matters relating to the integrity commissioner herself, I have made that information available through the appropriate channels for consideration and advice in accordance with my statutory obligations.\n\u201cI cannot make further comment on matters that are currently under CCC investigation.\n\u201cI stand on my record of respect, integrity, and leadership within the public service over many years.\u201d",

The government is also cutting petrol excise duties and road user charges by 25c a litre \u2013 changes that will come in at midnight on Monday.\nThe finance minister, Grant Robertson, said the changes would last for an initial three months and then be reviewed.\n\u201cThe global energy crisis has quickly become acute,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cWe cannot control the war in Ukraine nor the continued volatility of fuel prices but we can take steps to reduce the impact on New Zealand families.\u201d\nPetrol prices in New Zealand are over NZ$3 ($2) a litre and have been rising sharply in recent weeks. Unleaded petrol has gone up 15% since the start of the year and is expected to continue to rise.\n\u201cIn the long term we need to build greater resilience into our transport system so we are less vulnerable to spikes in the price of petrol,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cBut for now halving the cost public transport will provide some families with an alternative to filling up the tank.\u201d\nEven with the changes, the government expected petrol prices would continue their upward trajectory, Robertson said.\n\u201cWe do need to recognise that petrol prices are expected to continue to rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is continuing to undermine and destabilise global energy markets and, added to the other inflationary pressures the world has due to Covid supply chain disruptions, this is sadly not over yet.\u201d\nThe Ardern government has come under growing pressure to address rising cost of living in New Zealand, where households have faced significant increases in the cost of living and supermarket essentials.\nInflation in Aotearoa has hit a three-decade high, and is showing no sign of slowing. Inflation reached 5.9% at the end of 2021, and ANZ, the country\u2019s biggest bank, expects it to continue rising in 2022. In February, fruit and vegetable costs were up 17% year-on-year.\nNew Zealand\u2019s opposition has declared the country has a \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d. In recent polling, the Ardern-led Labour party fell behind the centre-right opposition, National, for the first time since the pandemic began.",

        "content": "Visa applicants say they are struggling with bureaucracy, unclear guidance and getting stuck in expensive hotels\nBritish families trying to help Ukrainian relatives get to safety in the UK have expressed frustration and fury at the continued bureaucratic and technical hurdles involved, despite government promises to cut the red tape involved in the family reunification scheme.\nApplicants said they were struggling with a range of problems \u2013 such as online application forms that crash, difficulty in getting clear guidance from helpline staff, some advice hotlines charging premium rates of 69p a minute, delays in visa processing times and extended, expensive stays in hotels in unfamiliar countries with no clarity about when visas will be granted.\nAlthough the rules governing the Home Office-administered Ukraine family scheme are to change from Tuesday, removing the need for applicants to get fingerprinted before coming to the UK, about 22,000 people who have already submitted applications have been given no information about how to proceed.\nSeveral families with elderly and vulnerable relatives told the Guardian that they were concerned about the protracted delays in processing UK visas.\nAnna Malyna White, an interpreter from Glasgow, was attempting to bring her parents, Viacheslav Malyna, 84, and Zhanna Malyna, 82, to the UK. Both are retired civil engineers from Kharkiv, with serious health conditions, but despite attempts to flag the urgency of their situation to Home Office staff, all three have been stuck in a hotel outside Budapest since last week, unclear about whether they will need to wait until 28 March, for a scheduled biometric appointment, or if the changing rules will allow the family to travel to the UK sooner.\nMalyna White visited the Budapest visa application centre on Thursday to try to get clarity. \u201cEmployees are stressed. Some looked on the verge of a nervous breakdown,\u201d she said. She was frustrated that the government had cited security concerns as its justification for putting applicants through a protracted checks. \u201cMy parents have been traveling to Britain to see their granddaughter for 16 years, they\u2019ve had several multiple entry visas, they\u2019re already in the Home Office system and they pose no threat to anyone. It is such a humiliating process.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThese are people who have already fled 900 kilometres in a car, without food or water or a change of clothes. They\u2019re running out of their medication, which we can\u2019t get here without a prescription \u2013 and now they have to wait for clearance. It makes no sense.\u201d\nHer father, Viacheslav Malyna, said: \u201cThe rules change so often and we still have no idea when we will actually get a visa. We feel very disappointed \u2013 not just from a moral point of view, but also because we\u2019re not rich people. We can\u2019t afford to stay on in a hotel because it is very costly.\u201d\nThe Home Office is to make it clear on Tuesday that those who have biometric appointments arranged later in the month no longer need to attend them, but will just need to upload their Ukrainian passports on to a website, and then wait for their applications to be processed \u2013 but applicants have not yet been informed that this is the revised procedure.\nOther applicants said that the processing time, even once the biometric tests have been done, is already taking longer than officials guidance suggests. Musician Robin Jax submitted an application on 4 March for his Ukrainian wife, Miroslava, and his mother-in-law Hanna Tkachenko, who uses a wheelchair. They met in Warsaw after she had fled Ukraine alongside about 2,000 people on a train designed for 560 passengers. Jax organised a visa appointment last Monday, where they gave fingerprints and were told that the application would probably be processed sometime after 24 hours and within five days. They are still waiting for confirmation that the visa has been granted.\n\u201cEvery UK Visas and Immigration member of staff I speak to is very compassionate, but they are caught by the fact that the policy is changing faster than they can answer our questions and we\u2019re just stuck in limbo, waiting,\u201d he said, adding that he was dismayed to be asked to give his bank details when he contacted a UKVI helpline, and charged 69p a minute for the call duration. \u201cThe system is set up against people who have had to leave their homes in the worst circumstances imaginable. I don\u2019t think the UK response has been particularly humanitarian.\u201d\nLawyer Rosie Schumm has spent the weekend trying to make applications on behalf of her mother\u2019s Ukrainian cousins, but she found that the website crashed when she tried to input information.\nShe said: \u201cThe system is impenetrable and extremely complicated for me to use, even as a lawyer and with English as my first language. It took me four hours to complete and, after asking me to provide the most ridiculous number of documents, guided me to an outsourced page for making appointments in a biometric centre in Moldova \u2013 which has no available appointments whatsoever.\u201d\nThe Home Office was unable to give average times for visa processing. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have expanded our Visa Application Capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here. This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need.\u201d",

While some will abolish a requirement for students to show proof that their hair is naturally curly or a colour other than black, some will keep the regulation, reportedly at the request of students and parents.\nYuto Kitamura, a member of the Tokyo metropolitan board of education, said the decision to scrap the most egregious regulations was a \u201cmajor step forward,\u201d according the Mainichi.\nAnother member, Kaori Yamaguchi, praised the move but said it had taken too long to address students\u2019 grievances.\n\u201cJapanese people have been taught to believe that it is a virtue to simply abide by the rules,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope this will be an opportunity for people to discuss what we should do to create a society where rules are observed in a way that\u2019s acceptable to everyone.\u201d\nThe debate over strict dress codes intensified several years ago after a high school student, then aged 18, sued education authorities in Osaka after her school had told her to dye her naturally brown hair black or face exclusion.\nLast year, the Osaka district court rejected her claim that she had been forced to dye her hair, but said the removal of her desk and name from the roster after she stopped attending classes had been unreasonable. It ordered the board of education to pay her \u00a5330,000 [\u00a32,152] in compensation.\nLast year, all public high schools in Mie, a prefecture in western Japan, abolished rules governing hairstyles, underwear colour and dating, with local officials conceding that the requirements were \u201crelics\u201d from a different age.\nSome schools had told students they must wear undershirts in beige, mocha or other colours that were not easily visible beneath their uniforms, while only \u201cmonotone white, grey, navy blue or black\u201d underwear was permissible.\nSome students have successfully campaigned for girls to be allowed to wear trousers to school, while others have called for a lifting of bans on makeup and hair products.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning.\nDiplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine are stepping up with talks between the Kyiv government and Russia set to resume today. The negotiations come after a deadly Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian military base near the Polish border heightened fears about an escalating conflict and as bombing resumed in Kyiv this morning. Although the Biden administration again rejected calls from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a Nato-enforced no-fly zone, his negotiators think there is some hope that Russia is \u201cbeginning to talk constructively\u201d. In another diplomatic initiative today, the US and China will meet amid concern that Beijing could supply arms to Putin\u2019s war machine. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, will meet his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in the Italian capital amid reports that Russia has asked China for weapons to bolster its faltering invasion of Ukraine.\nThe human cost of the war was brought home yesterday as Ukraine announced that at least 1,300 of its soldiers have been killed so far. The horrors of the conflict have been described by Ukrainians who managed to escape westwards, accusing the Russians of shooting people dead in the street as they advance through towns and villages. Tributes have been paid to the American journalist Brent Renaud, who has been killed in Ukraine, apparently by Russian fire. The Kremlin has reportedly urged Russian media to use clips of US Fox News host Tucker Carlson on their shows because he has been critical of the US response to the war.\nThe US faces a standoff with Saudi Arabia and the UAE over their refusal to pump more oil and bring prices down to ease pressure on western economies. Brent crude is down 3% to $109.37 this morning. A Russian default on its debts after western sanctions is not \u201cimprobable\u201d but would not trigger a global financial crisis, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

It comes as growing numbers of new infections in multiple countries led one expert to prompt speculation that Europe could be at the start of a sixth wave of Covid infections, partly driven by the \u201cstealth\u201d BA.2 Omicron variant. China\u2019s government has responded to a sharp rise in coronavirus infections by shutting down Shenzhen, a huge city of 17.5 million people.

Higher food and energy prices could drive inflation above 8% in the autumn, it warns, hitting poorer families disproportionately harder. Tenants could see a big increase in rent and bills, with research showing typical costs set to rise \u00a31,000 this year.\nBright spot \u2013 The UK\u2019s first solar farm owned by a health board and linked directly to a hospital has exceeded expectations by providing all the electricity needed to run the site on some days.

        "content": "Owen Horsley\u2019s new production of Henry VI, Parts 2 and 3, uses a cast of 120, including professionals and community participants, with some of them filming the action on stage\nI discovered recently that Richard Wagner liked to spend his evenings at home performing scenes from Henry VI. You can see why Shakespeare\u2019s monumental trilogy would appeal to the creator of the Ring cycle. You could also hardly have a starker contrast than Wagner\u2019s solo efforts \u2013 \u201cin the face of which,\u201d said his wife, Cosima, \u201cmortals can only be silent\u201d \u2013 and the RSC\u2019s upcoming production of Henry VI Parts 2 and 3, which will feature a total cast of 120.\nThis massive project is in the hands of Owen Horsley, who last year co-directed, with Gregory Doran, a streamed version of Henry VI: Part 1, which broke all the usual rules by allowing viewers access to rehearsals. Meeting Horsley during a lunch break on his epic venture, I was struck by the calm assurance of this Fife-born Scot. And, having spent eight years with Cheek by Jowl and as long working on the RSC history cycle, he clearly knows his Shakespeare.\nOf Henry VI, he says: \u201cThese plays, whenever they are done \u2013 especially at the RSC \u2013 invite experimentation. So I\u2019m working with a company of 25 professional actors including eight recent drama school graduates. For Part 2, which we call Henry VI: Rebellion, they will be joined by 74 adults recruited from the length and breadth of England \u2013 though, sadly, not Scotland \u2013 and 21 young performers from the RSC\u2019s Next Generation company. They will all come together for Jack Cade\u2019s rebellion when there\u2019s a stage direction that says \u2018Enter Cade and all his rabblement\u2019.\u201d Although, as Horsley says, there is a sense of scale to these plays, these 95 recruits \u201caren\u2019t simply there to make up the numbers\u201d. Some will have speaking parts, such as the character of Saunder Simpcox, who lays fraudulent claim to a miracle cure. \u201cOne way to experience Shakespeare is to see it,\u201d says Horlsey. \u201cEven better is to be in it. We are offering people the opportunity to connect with Shakespeare and hopefully pass on the joy of that experience to others.\u201d\nHorsley\u2019s appetite for experiment doesn\u2019t stop there. He has edited the text so that Act 5 of Part 2 now opens Part 3, forming a sequence of battles aptly titled Wars of the Roses. As if he didn\u2019t have challenges enough, Horsley is also exploring the use of cameras and projected images on stage. \u201cWhat Shakespeare is interested in,\u201d he says, \u201cis the humanity behind the history. There is a scene where Henry has to decide what to do when the Duchess of Gloucester, his aunt, is accused of treason. We will have a closeup of Mark Quartley as Henry to explore the dilemma he faces in making a judgment. During the battle scenes, we\u2019ll also have cameras on stage taking us into the thick of the conflict. The actors themselves, in medieval costume, will be working the cameras.\u201d When I say that this sounds \u201cvery Katie Mitchell\u201d, Horsley laughs and accepts it as a great compliment.\nThese plays naturally have their own history within the RSC. It was the Peter Hall and John Barton production of The Wars of the Roses, with Peggy Ashcroft and David Warner, that in 1963 shaped the company\u2019s identity. In 2008, along with Richard III, they formed the climax of an eight-play History cycle directed by Michael Boyd. I wondered if Horsley felt intimidated by the weight of the past. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen these plays on stage,\u201d he says, \u201cand I did my edit of the text without checking what others have done. I\u2019ve since gone back and been astonished at how much new material Barton wrote and I loved Michael Boyd\u2019s use of ghosts to show the interaction of past and present. But, as a director, you have to trust your own instincts and remember that you are doing these plays for an audience in 2022. In this industry, comparison is such a waste of energy and time.\u201d\nCritics, however, live by comparisons and some will inevitably be made with past RSC glories. But what strikes me is Horsley\u2019s passion for, and acute perceptiveness about, these plays. He points out that the chasm of experience between the high and low-born is pinpointed by a line from the wife of the fraudster, Simpcox, who says \u201cAlas, sir, we did it for pure need\u201d. He also says that on the first day of rehearsals he banned the word \u201cweak\u201d in describing Henry VI, seeing him as a complex man whose indecision stems from a desire to balance competing arguments. And when I ask if it has been unnerving to rehearse these plays at a time of war in eastern Europe, he says that there have been discussions every morning about the day\u2019s news. But he adds that although these plays are all about power, murder and ego, you don\u2019t have to strain to make them seem topical. \u201cI\u2019ve always seen Shakespeare,\u201d he says with a commonsense rare in the age of auteur directors \u201cas allowing the resonances to arrive unaided at the audience\u2019s ear\u201d.\nHenry VI: Rebellion opens at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford, on 1 April and Wars of the Roses on 11 April.",

Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing, including the newspaper\u2019s claims regarding Whiskey 108.\nGiving evidence on Monday, Person 24 said his patrol had led SAS troops into the village of Kakarak, a known insurgent stronghold in southern Uruzgan province, late in the afternoon of 12 April 2009.\nHis six-man patrol set up a security cordon around a bombed-out compound, given the codename Whiskey 108, while other troops assaulted the compound and secured it.\nAfter the compound was secured, Person 24 says he was standing guard outside, about two metres from another soldier, Person 14, when he saw Roberts-Smith emerge through a doorway.\nPerson 24 said he saw Roberts-Smith from side-on and did not see his face, but recognised him from his size, his gait, and his \u201cphysical demeanour\u201d.\n\u201cMr Roberts-Smith walked out of the compound \u2026 at this stage he was holding a man in his hand, it appeared he [the man] had come off the ground, he was being held by his pants or back of the shirt.\u201d\nPerson 24 said it was clear the man was alive: \u201cHe was making a noise as he came out \u2026 a grunting noise.\u201d\n\u201cHe [Roberts-Smith] marched about 15 metres directly out \u2013 he dropped the man on to the ground \u2013 and immediately put a machine gun burst into his back.\u201d\nPerson 24 said the machine-gun burst was \u201ceight to 10 rounds\u201d.\nPerson 24 told the court the slain man \u2013 whose identity has not been revealed in court \u2013 might have been a \u201cmedium-value target potentially\u201d as an \u201cIED [improvised explosive device] facilitator\u201d. But he was not a \u201ckill target\u201d at the time of the mission.\n\u201cIn BRS\u2019s defence, he might have been a kill target previously.\u201d\nPerson 24 said he \u201cdidn\u2019t agree with the agenda\u201d of some SAS soldiers who were seeking to undermine Roberts-Smith\u2019s reputation and decorations.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t agree with the fact BRS [Roberts-Smith] is here, under extreme duress, for killing bad dudes we went there to kill.\u201d\nPerson 24 told the court after the Australian troops assaulted and secured another compound \u2013 Whiskey 109 \u2013 his patrol walked back past Whiskey 108. He said he saw the body of the man with a prosthetic leg. He saw another soldier, Person 6, remove the leg, strap it to his backpack, and take it from the battlefield.\nThe leg was taken back to the Australian base in Tarin Kowt and used as a macabre celebratory drinking vessel at the SAS troops\u2019 unofficial bar, the Fat Ladies Arms. The court has been shown photographs of soldiers drinking from the leg.\nPerson 24 said he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a problem\u201d with people drinking from the war trophy prosthetic leg \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s black humour\u201d \u2013 and admitted he had drunk from it. Roberts-Smith was not pictured drinking from the leg and he denied having done so in evidence last year.\nRoberts-Smith does not dispute he shot and killed the man with the prosthetic leg but says the man was legitimately engaged in battle. He was extensively questioned about the Whiskey 108 mission when he gave evidence in this trial last year.\nRoberts-Smith told the court he killed the man because he was a threat to Australian troops. Roberts-Smith said he saw the man carrying a weapon and running, and killed him in accordance with troops\u2019 rules of engagement.\n\u201cHe had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that \u2026 hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.\u201d\nPerson 24 is the third soldier to give similar \u2013 though not identical \u2013 evidence that they saw an Australian soldier shoot an Afghan man at Whiskey 108, with two saying they believed it to be Roberts-Smith.\nOther soldiers have given evidence they saw a man with a prosthetic leg who was discovered hiding in a secret tunnel inside the compound and taken into custody of Australian troops before being \u201cmarched off\u201d by Roberts-Smith.\nA soldier anonymised before the court as Person 41 previously told the court he was also standing guard outside the compound when he saw Roberts-Smith \u201cfrog-marching\u201d an Afghan man \u201cby the scruff of his neck\u201d.\n\u201cHe [Roberts-Smith] had his machine gun in his right arm \u2026 he then proceeded to throw the Afghan male down on to the ground. The Afghan male landed on his back. [Roberts-Smith] then reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder and flipped him on to his stomach. Then I observed him lower his machine gun and shoot approximately three to five rounds into the back of the Afghan male.\n\u201cAfter he\u2019d done that, he looked up and saw me standing there, and looked at me and said \u2018are we all cool, we good?\u2019\n\u201cI just replied, \u2018yeah mate, no worries\u2019.\u201d\nUnder cross-examination, Person 41 denied lying about the incident but conceded he hadn\u2019t reported what he had allegedly seen to his commanders.\n\u201cI just wanted to keep quiet about the whole thing,\u201d he told the court. \u201cI was a new trooper, on my very first trip with the SAS, I just wanted to toe the line. It\u2019s the unwritten rule \u2013 you go along with whatever happens.\u201d\nAnother soldier, Person 14, who was standing next to Person 24, previously told the court the light was fading when he heard heavy footsteps to his right.\n\u201cAs I turned my head to my right, there were three Australian soldiers and a black object, which was similar to a human, that was thrown to the ground.\u201d\nPerson 14 said the person made a thudding, \u201cexpulsion of air\u201d noise as they hit the ground.\n\u201cThen a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para and fired an extended burst. It was loud, like a \u2018BRRRRRT\u2019 for one second.\n\u201cThat person turned and walked away out of sight back into Whiskey 108.\u201d\nPerson 14 said he said to another soldier: \u201cWhat the hell what that?\u201d He said he did not recognise the soldier who fired at the time.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nBut Person 14 said the soldier who shot the man was wearing a distinctive new camouflage paint, worn by only one SAS patrol in action that day, the five-man team of which Roberts-Smith was a member.\nPerson 14 told the court that, at the conclusion of the mission, he saw Roberts-Smith carrying the distinctive Minimi weapon at the troops\u2019 lay-up point.\n\u201cI saw who had the Para Minimi [machine gun],\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Ben Roberts-Smith.\u201d\nUnder cross-examination, Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith accused Person 24 of giving false evidence.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, in a court of law, give that evidence if it was false; I\u2019ve just sworn an oath, Mr Moses,\u201d Person 24 replied.\n\u201cYou are here to tell a story?\u201d\n\u201cI am here to tell the truth, Mr Moses, and you are getting the truth.\u201d\nPerson 24 was medically discharged from the SAS. He said prior to leaving the military, the mission at Whiskey 108 was the subject of \u201cmuch talk\u201d within the regiment.\n\u201cBut it has always been veiled, very veiled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something people didn\u2019t want to talk about,\u201d he said.\nMoses raised the question of whether Person 14 may have perjured himself last month when he told the court he had only spoken with his wife and his lawyer over a weekend when he was in the middle of giving evidence.\nPerson 24 told the court on Monday he phoned Person 14 after Person 14\u2019s first day in the witness box \u201cto see how he was going\u201d, though said they didn\u2019t discuss his evidence. Person 14 reportedly said it was \u201ctough\u201d and that Moses \u201cwent at him like a rabid dog\u201d during cross-examination.\nPerson 24 remains in the witness box. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",

Now \u201cWhat\u2019s Rachael riding?\u201d will be the starting point before the money goes down, as last season\u2019s leading rider at the meeting attempts to defend her crown.\nRachael Blackmore\u2019s six winners at the 2021 Festival proved that sporting history can be made even when there is no one there to remember the moment.\nShe jumped the final flight in silence on the way to victory on Honeysuckle, the favourite, in the Champion Hurdle, the first by a female rider in one of the meeting\u2019s four feature events. A few dozen people, at most, applauded her into the winner\u2019s enclosure afterwards. Quite unlike any other \u201cI was there\u201d moment, it was a soulless experience that none who witnessed it would ever care to repeat.\nIt will reboot the Cheltenham Festival like little else if Blackmore can retain her top-jockey status this week with 65,000-plus fans in full voice. Better yet if the only blip at last year\u2019s meeting \u2013 her decision to ride A Plus Tard and not the winner, Minella Indo, in the Gold Cup \u2013 could be rectified 12 months later. After Blackmore\u2019s groundbreaking success in the Grand National last April, again with no spectators in the stands, it is the only one of the National Hunt\u2019s three biggest races she has yet to win.\nThe 2022 Cheltenham Festival will open on mainly good going after a warm, drying day at the track yesterday resulted in the ground drying out rapidly to good, good-to-soft in places, having been good-to-soft, soft in places on Sunday. There will be no watering on the Old Course \u2013 which stages the first two days of the meeting \u2013 as up to 9mm of rain are forecast for the track on Wednesday.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s currently soft, good-to-soft in places on the New Course, which is in use for the last two days,\u201d Jon Pullin, Cheltenham\u2019s clerk of the course, said on Monday night. \u201cWe are dry today, with temperatures of around 13 or 14C, and it\u2019s a similar forecast for the opening day, but then on Wednesday there is some rain around, with the lower end of forecasts around 3mm, but some forecasts indicating up to 8 or 9mm.\u00a0\n\u201cIt will be spread throughout the day, but if it becomes heavier it will be during the afternoon,\" Pullin added. \"We irrigated the New Course on Friday with 12mm, based on the forecast we were given and the warm temperatures that were expected. We\u2019ll see where we are with forecasts for Wednesday and assess how much rain we actually get before making any decision on further watering of the New Course.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably something that will sink in when you\u2019ve got grey hair and you can enjoy what happened,\u201d she said recently. \u201cI suppose when I came home [from Aintree] and I was driving through my home town of Killenaule and I could see posters in the windows of people\u2019s homes with my face on them, it really resonated then what my personal achievements meant to the people where I\u2019m from.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a constant, revolving wheel and as a jockey you\u2019re looking forward. It\u2019s always: \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019\u201d Like Walsh in his pomp \u2013 and for most of the last 25 years, Frankie Dettori on the Flat \u2013 Blackmore is the rider the bookies fear, the one with the potential to eat into their profits like no other if she gets on a roll. And while the wheel may constantly turn, there is a strong sense of deja vu about several of her best chances, adding to the punters\u2019 confidence that what she has done once, she will be able to do again.\nJon Pullin, the new clerk of the course at Cheltenham, said \u00adyesterday that the fields for Tuesday's opening day of the track\u2019s Festival meeting \u00adtomorrow are \u201cvery competitive \u2026 with \u00adnumbers of runners comparable to or higher [than] recent years\u201d, even though the National Hunt Chase, the final event on the card, has attracted just seven runners, its smallest field this century.\u00a0\nFor the second year in a row, 10 will go to post for the Champion \u00adHurdle, which is in line with the 10-year \u00adaverage, while a 12-runner field for the Mares\u2019 Hurdle is the \u00adsecond-largest in the last five years. An 11-strong field for the Arkle \u00adTrophy is also well ahead of the five \u00adrunners\u00a0in 2021, as well as the 10-year \u00adaverage of 8.2.\u00a0\nHowever, the seven-runner field for the National Hunt Chase is the\u00a0first\u00a0in single figures this \u00adcentury,\u00a0for a race that attracted 26 \u00adrunners\u00a0in 2002 and has a 10-year average of 16.5. \nThe Supreme \u00adNovice\u00a0\u00adHurdle, \u00admeanwhile, has nine declared \u00adrunners, one more than in 2021 but well below the 10-year \u00adaverage of 15.7.\nDirect comparisons with last year\u2019s Festival are potentially misleading, as owners were banned from \u00adattending because of Covid-19 restrictions. This may have persuaded some owners with unfancied or so-called \u201csocial\u201d \u00adrunners to bypass the meeting.\u00a0\nThe small field for the National Hunt Chase, which has attracted just two runners from \u00adBritish stables, will still come as a \u00adsurprise to many punters, not least when the idea of expanding the \u00admeeting to five days is again being floated in some quarters.\nThe going for the first day of the Festival, meanwhile, is expected to be good-to-soft, after plans to continue watering the track were put on hold following 4mm of rain overnight on Saturday.\u00a0\nNo further rain is forecast for the track until Wednesday, while Thursday and Friday are expected to be dry and mild.\n\u201cWe are certainly not doing any watering at the moment and we\u2019ll monitor conditions and see how much it dries before making any decision on any further watering,\u201d Pullin said. \n\u201cGiven where we are currently and the forecast ahead, we will be \u00adsomewhere around good-to-soft for the start of the meeting.\u201d Greg Wood\nHoneysuckle, of course, is the star turn on Tuesday, as she attempts to extend her unbeaten career to 15 races and retain her champion\u2019s status. At around 4-6, she is one for the heavy-hitters, but \u00a35 and \u00a310 punters \u2013 not to mention Lady Gaga fans \u2013 will be doubling up with Telmesomethinggirl, last year\u2019s Mares\u2019 Novice Hurdle winner, when she lines up as likely favourite for the Mares\u2019 Hurdle 40 minutes later. At current odds, the double would pay a much more rewarding 7-1.\nBob Olinger will be a third Blackmore-ridden winner from 2021 attempting a follow-up in Thursday\u2019s Turners Novices\u2019 Chase, while Allaho, the runaway winner of the Ryanair Chase 12 months ago, is odds-on for a repeat success on Thursday. The potential for week-long accas culminating in A Plus Tard in the Gold Cup is obvious and, for the bookmakers, potentially toxic.\nAnd yet, unlike her predecessor as the racegoers\u2019 rider-of-choice, Blackmore will not start the meeting as favourite for the top-jockey prize.\nPaul Townend, who inherited Walsh\u2019s mantle of No 1 rider at the Willie Mullins stable, is a shade of odds-on with most layers to take the award for the second time in three years, with Blackmore as big as 11-2 and Davy Russell, who has a long list of fancied rides for Gordon Elliott, around the same price.\nTownend was the top Cheltenham jockey in 2020, the first Ruby-less Festival after his retirement in May 2019, and his fairly seamless move into the top job at the Mullins stable should have made him Walsh\u2019s obvious heir with the fans. But he does not have the X-factor \u2013 or, for that matter, the XX factor \u2013 that Blackmore brings to the proceedings, and while they are the friendliest of rivals, he will also be aboard the most obvious danger to the majority of Blackmore\u2019s key rides.\nPlumpton 1.00 Jazz King 1.35 Ballinsker 2.10 Kansas City Chief 2.45 One For Dunstan 3.20 Sainte Doctor (nap) 3.55 Tommy Dillion (nb)\nStratford 1.45 Raffles Gitane 2.20 Interne De Sivola 2.55 Corran Cross 3.30 Osprey Call\n4.05 Envoye Special 4.40 Rambo T\nTaunton 2.00 Highstakesplayer 2.35 Apothicaire 3.10 Some Detail 3.45 Amelia\u2019s Dance 4.20 Majestic Merlin 4.50 Sindabella\nWolverhampton 5.00 Plumette 5.30 Sweet Bertie 6.00 Progressive 6.30 Eternal Summer 7.00 Catbird Seat 7.30 It\u2019s A Love Thing\nOne or the other could romp through the meeting and post the six or seven wins that would all but guarantee the top riders\u2019 prize. If, on the other hand, they share out the spoils between them, there is an obvious chance for a rider like Russell to burst through the gap.\nRussell is very much the grizzled veteran of the narrative \u2013 his first Festival winner came as long ago as 2006, in the cross-country. But he has a happy knack of getting on the \u201cright\u201d one from Ireland in the meeting\u2019s handicaps and will get plenty of support from Elliott in that department throughout the week, in addition to several with big chances in the Grade Ones.\nTownend and Blackmore, by contrast, look mainly to the Graded contests for their winners, and while Mullins has had several handicap winners in recent years, they have often been the second- or third-string in the betting.\nIt is 10-1 bar Blackmore, Townend and Russell \u2013 which brings in Nico de Boinville, the leading British-based rider, among others \u2013 and the race to be the human face of the 2022 Festival is highly likely to be a three-cornered contest. Blackmore will be the fans\u2019 favourite while Townend heads the bookies\u2019 lists, but Russell could yet be the one to beat them both.",

These are appalling atrocities committed on innocent civilians in Ukraine by the Russians,\u201d Javid said, saying the World Health Organization had documented 31 attacks so far on health facilities.\n\u201cThese are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,\u201d he added. Asked how, Javid said: \u201cHe will be ultimately held responsible for sure by the international court. Today, the justice secretary, my colleague, is going to The Hague and he\u2019ll be meeting there with the chief prosecutor and others, offering UK support to gather evidence.\u201d\nAsked about potential Nato support for Ukraine, Javid stressed that the alliance was a \u201cdefensive organisation,\u201d but warned of consequences for Russia if Nato nations were targeted, after strikes close to the Polish border.\n\u201cIf a single Russia toecap steps into Nato territory it will be considered an act of war,\u201d Javid said.\nOvernight, Javid\u2019s department announced that 21 Ukrainian children who have cancer had arrived in England with immediate family members to have NHS treatment.\n\u201cThey will now be cared for here in the UK for as long as is needed,\u201d Javid said. \u201cTo do this it was quite an operation over the weekend. A number of partners were involved, and I\u2019m very grateful to them, especially the Polish government and the NHS. And I\u2019m pleased that we can provide support in this way.\u201d\nAsked if more such patients would come, Javid said the UK was \u201cworking with international partners,\u201d and that another aspect was to support Poland and Moldova.\nThe government is expected to announce details of a scheme later on Monday by which Britons can host Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK in their homes for six months.\nAsked about concerns raised from some refugees about the ability to carry out enough checks in the time provided, Javid said: \u201cThis is an unprecedented situation, and I think that it\u2019s important to listen to charities that have experience, and help work out how this can work.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the fact we haven\u2019t done this before should be some kind of block on not trying to do this in this way at this point. I think it is very valuable for a Ukrainian refugee arriving in the UK to have a British host to help them in so many ways, not least to integrate into British life.\u201d\nAsked if he would consider hosting a refugee, Javid said he was \u201cstarting to have a conversation with my wife about that,\u201d but did not commit to doing so.",

        "content": "Lisa Keightley has shouldered responsibility after a third consecutive defeat for England\u2019s women has left them facing early elimination in their World Cup defence. England can still qualify for the semi-finals but the three-wicket loss to South Africa in Mount Maunganui means that even if they win their final four matches they are now reliant on other results to go their way.\nAs in their previous defeat against West Indies, England fluffed chances in the field to allow South Africa to chase down their 235 with four balls to spare and Keightley said it was difficult to explain why the errors crept into their game.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really put our finger on it, the head coach said. \u201cWe have fielded pretty well throughout the Ashes and took a lot more chances than we have today. We came into this World Cup to play better than we have. It\u2019s been frustrating for myself and the coaching staff and frustrating for the players. For some reason we haven\u2019t clicked and we\u2019re finding it really hard to do so.\n\u201cAs the coach, I take a huge amount of responsibility [for the losses]. It\u2019s up to me to drive the team and get the wins on the board. The players are pretty gutted.\u201d\nMarizanne Kapp, by contrast, was jubilant after South Africa secured their first World Cup win over England for 20 years and avenged their 2017 semi-final defeat in the process. They did so largely thanks to the 32-year-old\u2019s first international five-wicket haul for 13 years and a crucial 32 from 42 balls towards the end of their run chase.\n\u201cThe previous World Cup we were extremely disappointed with our performances, especially against England, and we knew this time around that we are good enough that we could do that today,\u201d she said. \u201cThis World Cup is what we\u2019ve worked towards. I believe this team is just going to get stronger and better.\u201d\nChasing 236, South Africa had been reduced to 199 for six in the 44th over after England made regular inroads; Kapp would have been back in the dugout, but for a reprieve on nine courtesy of the DRS, with replays showing Sophie Ecclestone\u2019s delivery missing leg stump. But Kapp made hay, smashing Katherine Brunt for six over backward square-leg and running hard with partner Trisha Chetty. She eventually fell leg-before to Anya Shrubsole with 10 runs needed, but though England took it to the final over, Nat Sciver sent down a wide and Chetty pulled the winning run over midwicket to finish the job with four balls to spare.\nThe main beneficiary of England\u2019s profligacy in the field was Laura Wolvaardt, whose 77 was the mainstay of the South African run chase until Kapp got in on the act. The opener was put down by Tammy Beaumont at backward point on four and by Kate Cross on 23 in a caught-and-bowled chance that went begging. Amy Jones also missed what should have been a straightforward stumping against her, just after Wolvaardt brought up a half-century.\nWolvaardt made it count, sharing fifty partnerships with Tazmin Brits (23) and Sune Luus (36), driving hard, and along the way becoming South Africa\u2019s leading run-scorer in World Cups \u2013 before holing out to midwicket in the 36th over.\nKapp\u2019s opening spell of 5-1-15-2, moving the ball around in ways that baffled the England batters, had set the tone. Danni Wyatt \u2013 promoted to the opening spot after England dispensed with Lauren Winfield-Hill \u2013 sliced a fuller ball to backward point, where Wolvaardt held on after a juggle. Then Heather Knight was caught halfway between leaving and playing and got an inside edge on to her stumps. The freak dismissal of Sciver by Masabata Klaas in the 12th added to England\u2019s woes: she tried to pull but the ball came off the back of her bat and ballooned up to Lizelle Lee at slip.\nKapp\u2019s slower ball did further damage in the final overs, yielding three quick wickets as Brunt (17 off 23), Sophia Dunkley (26 off 38) and Cross all miscued and were caught.\nIn between, Tammy Beaumont (62) and Jones (53) had rescued England from 42 for three with a crucial century partnership, making full use of some loose deliveries from the South Africa spinners. For Jones, it was a welcome return to form after a difficult Ashes; she drove and pulled beautifully on the way to her first World Cup fifty.\nThe problem was that neither could push on. Beaumont was given a life on 62, dropped behind by Chetty, but fell five balls later without adding to that score, trapped lbw by Klaas in the 34th.\nJones was dismissed not long after in unfortunate fashion, run out after Dunkley plonked the ball to midwicket and called for the single. The fielder? None other than Kapp.",

        "content": "Program to facilitate access to antivirals will have a limited impact because pharmacists are restricted from prescribing the pills\nA major new Biden administration initiative to facilitate access to Covid-19 antivirals will have a limited impact and fail to mitigate certain health inequities, major pharmacist groups argue, because pharmacists are restricted from prescribing the pills.\nAnnounced in Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, the \u201cTest to Treat\u201d program is meant to address the maddening difficulty Americans have had in accessing Covid-19 treatments. The administration will channel newly increasing stocks of antiviral pills to major retail pharmacies that have in-house clinics, providing one-stop testing and antivirals access.\nThe program, which the administration aims to provide for free (in the face of fierce Republican opposition to new Covid-19 spending), is also slated to roll out in Veterans Affairs clinics, community health centers and long-term care facilities.\nMajor participants include some 250 Walgreens stores, 225 Kroger Little Clinics and 1,200 CVS MinuteClinics. CVS clinics in particular are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prescribe the two currently available Covid antivirals, Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid and Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics\u2019 molnupiravir.\nIn a 9 March letter to Biden calling for pharmacists to be granted authority to prescribe these pills, 14 organizations representing pharmacies and pharmacists insisted Test to Treat\u2019s impact will be compromised by the fact that such in-house clinics are relatively limited in number and largely in urban areas.\n\u201cUnfortunately, rural and underserved communities are less likely to benefit from your test to treat approach because of this limitation,\u201d the letter states.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of Americans live within five miles of one of approximately 60,000 pharmacies.\n\u201cThe FDA is still blocking us from leveraging the most accessible healthcare provider out there to make sure that these patients can get these drugs easily,\u201d said Michael Ganio, a Columbus, Ohio pharmacist, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which is a signatory of the letter to Biden.\n\u201cAs far as expanding access,\u201d said Ganio, Test to Treat is \u201cnot doing a lot\u201d.\nThe need for Covid-19 antivirals is likely to be greater in rural areas, at least on a per-capita basis. A recent CDC study found that through January, 58.5% of people aged five and older in rural counties had received at least one coronavirus vaccination shot, compared with 75.4% in urban counties.\nPaxlovid and molnupiravir are authorized for individuals at high risk of severe Covid-19, in particular unvaccinated people with certain medical conditions. Paxlovid was 88% effective at preventing hospitalization and death in its clinical trial. Molnupiravir proved just 30% effective. The FDA only authorizes its use when other treatments are unavailable or aren\u2019t advised for an individual.\nSufficient supply of Paxlovid will be key to Test to Treat. Since late December, the federal government has delivered a woefully inadequate 700,000 Paxlovid courses to states, the biweekly allotment increasing from 100,000 in January to 175,000 in March.\nThe administration has claimed it will distribute 1m courses in March and 2.5m in April. A Pfizer representative would only state that the company plans to deliver a cumulative 10m courses by the end of June. The administration has agreed to purchase 20m courses, slated to be delivered by the end of September.\nIn September 2021, the US Department of Health and Human Services amended a federal public health emergency law, the Prep Act, to grant licensed pharmacists the authority \u201cto order and administer select Covid-19 therapeutics\u201d \u2013 which at the time meant monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.\nBut when the FDA authorized Paxlovid and molnupiravir in December, it explicitly restricted pharmacists from prescribing them.\nAuthors of the letter to Biden say they submitted data to the FDA at the end of January, hoping to persuade it to grant pharmacists prescribing authority.\nThese groups have also lobbied the federal government to ensure Medicare Part B would reimburse pharmacists for such prescribing \u2013 a move that would probably lead health insurers to follow.\nPrescribing Paxlovid safely can be challenging, because it may interact harmfully with other medications. Additionally, the FDA advises against providing the treatment to those with severe kidney or liver impairment. Experts have also raised concerns about molnupiravir\u2019s potential toxicities. It cannot be prescribed to minors and is not advised for pregnant women.\nChanapa Tantibanchachai, an FDA press officer, said the agency\u2019s decision to forbid pharmacists from prescribing Paxlovid and molnupiravir \u201cwas based on several factors, including the drugs\u2019 side-effect profiles, the need to assess potential for drug interactions, the need to assess potential kidney function problems (including the severity of potential problems), and the need to evaluate patients for pre-existing conditions\u201d linked to severe Covid-19.\nTantibanchachai said the FDA could revise the policy \u201cas new data and information become available\u201d.\nOn 4 March, the American Medical Association said the \u201cpharmacy based clinic component of the Test to Treat plan flaunts patient safety and risks significant negative health outcomes\u201d. The AMA argued that by prescribing Covid antivirals at such clinics, providers may endanger patients for whom they lack a comprehensive medical history.\nThe pharmacy groups insisted in their letter to Biden they have the expertise to prescribe these medications.\nIn an email to the Guardian, Al Carter, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, stated: \u201cPharmacists have more complete access to the patients\u2019 medication in comparison to physicians, especially since most patients have more than one prescriber, who don\u2019t necessarily talk with each other.\n\u201cPharmacists spend their whole education focused on medications and their impacts on the body; whereas physicians take the minimal number of classes on pharmacology.\u201d\nKatherine Yang, a clinical pharmacist at the University of California, San Francisco, said: \u201cThere are a lot of studies that show that when you increase services in community pharmacies, you improve care. In a lot of neighborhoods and rural areas, people may not have access to primary care, and pharmacists are the most accessible public health provider the patients can see.\u201d",

He suggested this was unlikely, given the required state government approvals.\nOn electric vehicles, Morrison said he was \u201cnot forcing anyone to drive anything\u201d and the Coalition\u2019s policy was one of \u201cchoice not mandates\u201d. In November Morrison deliberately mischaracterised Labor\u2019s electric vehicles policy as somehow forcing drivers to adopt electric vehicles.\nThe town hall continued Morrison\u2019s attempts to reframe the election around national security and the economy in a bid to recover the government\u2019s poor standing in the polls. On Monday the Newspoll found the Coalition trailing 45% to Labor\u2019s 55% in two-party preferred terms.\nMorrison argued the May election would be a choice about who was \u201cbest prepared and most seasoned to see us through\u201d global instability including the war in Ukraine.\nIn front of an at-times partisan crowd that cheered for the re-election of the Coalition, Morrison accused Albanese of \u201cpretending to be everyone\u201d \u2013 from John Howard, to Bob Hawke, to Kevin Rudd. The prime minister claimed, by contrast, he was not \u201cpretending to be anyone else\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019m still wearing the same glasses, and the same suits,\u201d Morrison said, in reference to Albanese\u2019s new look.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy in my own skin \u2026 When you\u2019re prime minister you can\u2019t pretend to be someone else.\u201d\nMorrison said his faith \u201cinforms the why not the what\u201d of his policy agenda, explaining he had been \u201ctransparent\u201d about his religious belief but it was \u201cnot a reason to vote for me or not to vote for me\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nMorrison criticised Labor, claiming the opposition saw the Covid-19 pandemic as an invitation to be part of Australians\u2019 lives \u201cfor the rest of eternity\u201d.\n\u201c[We have] a business-led economy, that isn\u2019t one with government at the centre of our lives, telling us what to do. Frankly, we\u2019ve had enough of government telling us what to do in the last couple of years.\u201d\nMorrison said the Coalition would aim to repay debt by \u201cbending\u201d the curve of government expenditure down and growing the economy, noting that the Coalition had taken six years to return the budget to balance after it was elected in 2013.\nIt \u201cdidn\u2019t go down the slash and burn approach\u201d, he said, because of stiff economic headwinds.\nMorrison said Labor\u2019s slogan to \u201cbuild back stronger\u201d after the Covid pandemic \u201csounds good\u201d but claimed it implicitly suggested that there was \u201csomething wrong with Australia before the pandemic\u201d.\nMorrison also claimed that Labor would have spent $81bn more than the Coalition throughout the pandemic, because it had called for jobkeeper wage subsidies to be extended.\nLabor \u201ccomplain about the debt, but wanted to spend more,\u201d he said, labelling that phenomenon \u201cAlbanomics\u201d.\nMorrison defended his handling of the pandemic, arguing although there were many \u201cknockers\u201d of the national cabinet, across 64 meetings federal, state and territory leaders had agreed on most issues.\n\u201cName one family who gets together every night and never has a disagreement,\u201d he said.\nAsked why the Coalition wasn\u2019t ahead in the polls, Morrison argued that through the pandemic and natural disasters \u201cpeople have suffered a lot\u201d and \u201cunderstandably people will get very frustrated\u201d.\nHe expressed confidence that closer to the election the choice of \u201cwho you want to lead\u201d would become clearer.",

        "content": "Zelenskiy pushes for meeting with Putin after deadly strike near Polish border. Plus, are there more wheels or doors in the world?\nDiplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine have increased, with Ukrainian and Russian negotiators to resume talks after Russia attacked a base near the Polish border and fighting raged across Ukraine.\nA barrage of Russian missiles hit Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25km) from the Polish border that previously hosted Nato military instructors, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a Ukrainian official said yesterday.\nThe violence continued this morning, with shelling of a residential building in the capital killing two.\nBut hopes of diplomatic progress were raised after Russia and Ukraine gave positive assessments after weekend negotiations.\nWhat\u2019s happening in the villages Russia has taken over? Witnesses have said Russian soldiers are shooting randomly at buildings, throwing grenades down roads and going from house to house confiscating phones and laptops. People have also been shot dead in the street.\nWhy is Tucker Carlson in the news today? According to a report on Sunday, earlier this month the Putin regime in Moscow sent out an instruction to friendly media outlets: use more clips of Carlson.\nWhat else is happening? Here\u2019s everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion.\nIt has been more than two years since Donald Trump declared a national emergency owing to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic.\nNow, even though the threat from Covid remains, US public health officials and researchers are looking to the next potential pandemic \u2013 whether it\u2019s influenza, another coronavirus, antimicrobial resistance, or a different health threat entirely \u2013 as they hope to build on the progress and avoid the pitfalls of the past two years, writes Melody Schreiber.\nScientists, several of whom have advised Joe Biden, have released a 136-page roadmap for moving from the Covid crisis to what they describe as the \u201cnext normal\u201d.\nThese investments include supporting health workers and strengthening health systems, as well as supporting survivors with long-term symptoms.\nHas Obama tested positive for Covid? Yes. \u201cI just tested positive for Covid,\u201d the former president, 60, tweeted yesterday, adding that other than a scratchy throat, he felt fine. \u201cMichelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative,\u201d he said.\nHere are eight charts that capture the past two years. These graphics show the costs and cautious hopes for the future.\nAustralia and the Netherlands have launched legal proceedings against Russia through the International Civil Aviation Organization for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\nThe legal action could compel Russia to take part in stalled negotiations with the two countries, and could also result in it being penalized by the UN-linked organisation that is responsible for the administration of international aviation law.\nAustralia and the Netherlands want compensation and an apology from the Russian Federation for the MH17 disaster. Two hundred and ninety-eight people, including 38 Australians, were killed when the aircraft was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.\nRussia, which has denied involvement despite the findings of an international investigation, unilaterally withdrew from negotiations with the two countries in October 2020.\nOn what grounds are the countries taking the legal action? The joint action is under article 84 of the convention on international civil aviation, and will allege that Russia is in breach of the Chicago convention that underpins aviation law.\nWas Russia responsible for the disaster? Australia and the Netherlands say there is the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that the flight was shot down by a Russian Buk-Telar surface-to-air missile system, which was transported from Russia to an agricultural field in the east of Ukraine on the morning of 17 July 2014.\nThe director Jane Campion has called the actor Sam Elliott \u201ca little bit sexist\u201d and \u201ca bitch\u201d, for criticising The Power of the Dog, her Oscar- and Bafta-nominated western, for its driving theme of repressed homosexual desire and for being filmed in New Zealand.\nBiden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who is meeting China\u2019s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome today, has warned that Beijing will \u201cabsolutely\u201d face consequences if it helps Moscow evade sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.\nWilliam Barr has doubled down on his vow to vote for Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee in 2024, despite writing in his new book that Trump is dangerously unsuited for the job. He said: \u201cElections are binary choice, and unfortunately sometimes it\u2019s choosing the lesser of two evils.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s hardline stance on Russia has won him widespread plaudits, but with the most serious oil shock in decades now a reality, the president\u2019s attempt to cushion the blowback continues to meet resistance from the two allies he needs most.\nAt some point in the stretch of days between the start of the pandemic\u2019s third year and the feared launch of world war three, a new phrase entered the zeitgeist, a mysterious harbinger of an age to come: people were going \u201cgoblin mode\u201d. The term embraces the comforts of depravity: spending the day in bed watching 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 on mute while scrolling endlessly through social media, pouring the end of a bag of chips in your mouth, writes Kari Paul.\nRises in sea levels driven by the climate crisis could reach 40cm (15in) by 2050, says Ruth Cerezo-Mota, an oceanographer at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), with four to 20 metres of beach on the Quintana Roo\u2019s coastline lost. \u201cThis would mean chaos\u201d, says Christian Appendini, a coastal engineer at UNAM. \u201cAll the beaches in front of urban developments would probably disappear unless drastic nature-based beach restoration measures are taken.\u201d\nThe New Zealander who unwittingly sparked an agonising global debate over whether there are more doors or wheels in the world has come to his own conclusion \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m firmly team wheels\u201d. Auckland man Ryan Nixon, 37, decided to create a poll for his fewer than 1,500 Twitter followers. \u201cMy mates and I are having the STUPIDEST debate \u2026 And I am here for it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDo you think there are more doors or wheels in the world?\u201d By Sunday, the poll had exploded.\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

        "content": "Jilin residents ordered to stay at home and reservists sent to disinfect streets as 1,437 new cases reported across China\nChina\u2019s government has ordered a province of 24 million people into lockdown as it tries to contain a Covid-19 outbreak that has spread to multiple locations.\nAuthorities reported 1,437 new cases across the country, including 895 in Jilin province, which was put under lockdown measures. People living in the province have been banned from moving around, and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for permission from police. Restrictions were already in place in two cities, Jilin and Changchun.\nThe industrial province sent 7,000 reservists to help with the response, from keeping order and registering people at testing centres to using drones to carry out aerial spraying and disinfection, the state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nOn Sunday a government notice said all residential communities in Shenzhen, a city of 17.5 million people, were being placed under \u201cclosed management,\u201d meaning they would be locked down. Every resident would undergo three rounds of testing, for which they were allowed to leave their homes, and all buses and subways were suspended.\nAll businesses in the finance and technology hub, which borders Hong Kong, were ordered to close or work from home unless they supplied food, utilities or other necessities, according to the notice. On Monday afternoon Foxconn, which produces iPhones for Apple, announced it was among businesses suspending operations in Shenzhen. Its larger production site in Zhengzhou remains open, and the company said it would reopen when advised by the local government.\nNo one can leave the city except in special circumstances and with a negative test result obtained within 24 hours prior to exit. Local communities and residences had established monitoring teams with a \u201cwarm-hearted service hotline,\u201d it said.\nThe restrictions are due to stay in place until at least 20 March, adding Shenzhen to a number of other cities under various restrictions, including China\u2019s most populous city, Shanghai.\nSome residents of Cangzhou, south of Beijing, were also told to stay at home after nine cases were reported there, according to a government notice.\nAuthorities in Jilin province are stepping up anti-disease measures after concluding their earlier response was inadequate, according to Zhang Yan, the deputy director of the provincial health commission.\n\u201cThe emergency response mechanism in some areas is not sound enough,\u201d Zhang said at a news conference. The mayor and deputy party chief of Jilin city, the director of the Changchun health commission and the party chief at a Jilin university were among at least 26 officials to be sacked or punished for their alleged poor responses to the current outbreak, state media reported.\nThe case numbers reported among China\u2019s 1.4 billion people are low compared with other countries, but represent the country\u2019s worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic. China\u2019s zero-Covid strategy of swiftly crushing outbreaks through resource-intensive mass testing and lockdowns has so far been successful. However, as in other countries, the emergence of the Omicron variant has challenged defences. Chinese authorities have for the first time approved antigen self-testing products to supplement the government-run nucleic acid testing.\nChina is among a few governments around the world still committed to the zero-tolerance approach. Across the strait, Taiwan is reporting just a few \u2013 or zero \u2013 daily community cases and appears to have contained Omicron outbreaks. It is maintaining its strict border controls, and some social restrictions, and is yet to be faced with a large-scale Omicron outbreak.\nIn Hong Kong the variant has overwhelmed the city and its government\u2019s insistence on sticking to a strategy of elimination over mitigation. On Sunday it reported more than 32,400 cases. Hospitals have been swamped, with patient beds in lobbies and carparks. As of last week Hong Kong had the highest death rate in the developed world, inflaming criticism of the government for failing to adequately prepare for a large-scale outbreak during two years of being largely Covid-free.\n\u201cPeople should not get the wrong impression that the virus situation is now under control,\u201d said Dr Albert Au, an expert with the government\u2019s Centre for Health Protection. \u201cOnce we let our guard down, it\u2019s possible that [infections] will bounce back and rise again.\u201d\nZhang Wenhong, China\u2019s top infectious disease expert, on Monday said Hong Kong\u2019s outbreak was in the \u201cearly stage of an exponential rise,\u201d and said it was inevitable that some would panic but people should retain confidence in the effectiveness of lockdowns, testing and restrictions. \u201cAs long as we slow down, the virus will not be fast,\u201d he said.\nZhang said opening up would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for China, with many elderly people unvaccinated, but once the outbreak was contained there must be a \u201cmoderate and sustainable\u201d lasting strategy.\n\u201cWe must take advantage of the rare opportunity period and window period brought about by the inevitable social reset, and prepare more complete, smart, and sustainable coping strategies,\u201d he said.\nAdditional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu",

        "content": "The four-time grand slam champion was reduced to tears by a heckler at Indian Wells. But abuse from the stands appears to be on the increase\nNaomi Osaka\u2019s emotional, tear-filled comments after she was heckled during her second-round loss in Indian Wells on Saturday immediately drew comparisons to the infamous incident at the same tournament in 2001 when the Williams sisters were mercilessly \u2013 and unjustly - booed. While the setting was the same and both instances reveal an ugly side of fandom, the circumstances surrounding each are decidedly not similar.\nAt the 2001 tournament, minutes before a highly anticipated semi-final clash between Venus and Serena (who at that point were already both slam champions), Venus withdrew due to an injury. The next day, during the final between Serena and Kim Clijsters, a significant portion of the crowd heckled and booed Serena, as well as Venus and their father Richard who were watching the match at courtside. Serena eventually won the final as a proud and defiant Richard looked on.\nThere was much talk at the time that perhaps Richard Williams had \u201corchestrated\u201d the withdrawal by Venus so as to give Serena a chance to shine. And while Richard Williams left himself open for criticism with his highly unconventional \u2013 and extraordinarily successful \u2013 coaching techniques, the thought that the sisters would conspire and rob the event of fair competition was a stretch. And, indeed, the sisters had already faced off on a bigger stage when Venus defeated Serena in the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2000, just eight months prior.\nWhat made the 2001 situation with the Williams sisters particularly repulsive was the mob mentality of an overwhelmingly white, well-off throng spewing insults and raining down boos on a young, black athlete.\nSerena said afterward that, \u201cNothing like this had ever happened to me. What was most surprising about this uproar was the fact that tennis fans are typically a well-mannered bunch. They\u2019re respectful. They sit still. And in Palm Springs, especially, they tended to be pretty well-heeled, too. But I looked up and all I could see was a sea of rich people \u2013 mostly older, mostly white \u2013 standing and booing lustily, like some kind of genteel lynch mob.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to use such inflammatory language to describe the scene, but that\u2019s really how it seemed from where I was down on the court. Like these people were gonna come looking for me after the match.\u201d\nThe Williams sisters from that point on boycotted the event until 2015 when Serena once again played in Indian Wells (Venus joined her a year later).\nFast forward 21 years to Saturday\u2019s incident with Osaka and the circumstances are different. This time there was no entitled, bullying mob, but rather a sole fan who let loose with the pathetic invective of \u201cyou suck, Naomi\u201d. If it wasn\u2019t so hurtful to Osaka, there is humor in the utter absurdity and idiocy of such a comment. Osaka \u201csucks\u201d, really? One of the greatest athletes on the planet, who no doubt has accomplished more and worked harder for such than the woman who felt it was OK to yell such a thing.\nAndrew Krasny, who handles the post-match interviews on-court for Indian Wells, was no doubt aware of the tournament\u2019s history when he said to Osaka, \u201cOut of about 10,000 people, one person\u2019s voice can\u2019t weigh out 9,999 others. We love you here.\u201d\nUnfortunately, abuse from fans who feel they have the right to say anything, no matter how vulgar or just plain wrong, because they have paid to watch athletes perform, is increasingly common. Players at this year\u2019s Australian Open questioned whether fans\u2019 boos (or was it siuus?) had gone too far. In soccer, England players were racially abused by their own \u2018supporters\u2019 after their loss at last year\u2019s European Championship; the NBA has banned fans for confronting players at games; and NFL players were booed during a moment of silence to acknowledge inequality. The behavior even extends to professional wrestling, where WWE star Seth Rollins was attacked by a fan at an event in New York last year.\nAnd the discourtesy is a reflection of a wider breakdown of respect in society. The unofficial rules of decorum, part of the collective and informal social contract, have been tossed aside. One need only to look back at Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech a couple of weeks ago when the ultra-conservative member of Congress Lauren Boebert booed while the president was speaking about military veterans\u2019 issues and the death of his son Beau.\nOsaka has been struggling to deal with the demands of being in the spotlight and she\u2019s had a very rough 12 months. Most striking was her refusal to engage in press conferences at the 2021 French Open, which resulted in her withdrawal from the tournament. Some believed answering questions is part of an athlete\u2019s job, others commended Osaka for having the courage to reveal her vulnerability in a very public forum. She went on to miss Wimbledon due to mental health issues and, after a third-round loss at the US Open, she took another break from the sport saying that winning did not make her \u201cfeel happy\u201d any longer.\nYet putting aside the obvious fact that heckling someone who has been struggling with their mental health is ignorant and cruel, the woman who told Osaka she \u201csucks\u201d should be reminded of this: though the 24-year-old has tumbled from world No 1 to 78, she has still won a slam in each of the last four years. No other tennis player aside from Novak Djokovic can say the same.",

The additional strain of war could tip the global food system into disaster, he warned.\n\u201cWe were already having problems with food prices,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cWhat countries are doing now is exacerbating that, and the war is putting us in situation where we could easily fall into a food crisis.\u201d\nWheat prices hit record highs in recent days, though they have fallen back slightly. Overall, food prices have been rising since the second half of 2020, according to the FAO, and reached an all-time high in February, after wheat and barley prices rose by nearly a third and rapeseed and sunflower oil by more than 60% during 2021. The price of urea, a key nitrogen fertiliser, has more than tripled in the past year, on rising energy prices.\nAt least 50 countries depend on Russia and Ukraine for 30% or more of their wheat supply, and many developing countries in northern Africa, Asia and the near east are among the most reliant.\nPoor countries are bearing the brunt of the price increases. Many of the poorest countries were already struggling financially, with some facing debt crises, amid the pandemic.\n\u201cMy greatest fear is that the conflict continues \u2013 then we will have a situation of significant levels of food price rises, in poor countries that were already in an extremely weak financial situation owing to Covid-19,\u201d said Torero, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on food and hunger. \u201cThe number of chronically hungry people will grow significantly, if that is the case.\u201d\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has reduced developing countries\u2019 capacity to cope. \u201cFood systems were able to be more resilient in 2019, though they struggled at the beginning,\u201d said Torero. \u201cStocks were very high at the beginning of Covid-19, there was the capacity then to respond to the shock. But having Covid-19 for two years has weakened the resilience of food systems.\u201d\nThe war in Ukraine presents multiple threats to food security that will be felt across the world, according to the FAO. Ukraine and Russia are major food exporters, so the war directly threatens supplies of staples such as wheat, maize and sunflower oil.\nUkraine alone supplied 12% of global wheat before the war, and was the biggest producer of sunflower oil. About two-thirds of the country\u2019s wheat exports had already been delivered before the invasion, but the rest is now blocked, and farmers may be unable to continue with spring planting, or take in grain harvests in the summer.\nBut the crisis goes deeper: Ukraine and Russia are also major producers of fertiliser, prices for which had already leapt under high energy prices \u2013 and the war is sending energy prices higher still, with further impacts on agricultural production costs.\nThere is also the threat of countries closing their markets in response. The worst food price spikes in recent memory struck in 2007-08 and resumed in 2010-12, caused by high energy prices followed by poor weather. Those sudden peaks contributed to riots and political upheavals, the shocks of which are still being felt.\nThe agriculture ministers of the G7 group of richest countries met on Friday to coordinate a response, urging countries to keep markets open.\nRussia played a role in the crises more than a decade ago, with restrictions on exports, especially in 2010 when Vladimir Putin banned all grain exports after drought in key growing regions. If Putin were to restrict or redirect exports again \u2013 after his manipulation of energy exports in the run-up to the war \u2013 it would cause severe problems in global food markets.\n\u201cRight now, we can\u2019t say prices are higher than in 2007-08, but it can get worse. If the energy and fertiliser situation becomes more serious, that will be worse than in 2007-08. If you add to that the potential for export restrictions, it will get worse,\u201d Torero said.\n\u201cOf course Russia can do what they want with their production. If they restricted exports, then the situation would get worse. Prices would increase even more,\u201d he added. \u201cWe urge all countries, not only Russia but all countries, not to put export restrictions in place.\u201d\nTorero urged countries to keep food systems open and to share information on stocks, harvests and food availability, to try to even out supply issues. Countries that were in a position to produce more should do so, he said.\n\u201cRight now, the short-term problem is availability. We need to find ways to fill the gap [in production caused by the war],\u201d he said. \u201cWe think the gap can be closed somewhat, but not 100%. Countries should also try to diversify their suppliers.\u201d\nEven if the conflict were to be resolved quickly, the impacts would be felt for some time, he said. The soaring price of fertiliser, for instance, will have a delayed impact, reducing yields for harvests still to come, as farmers start to use less of it now.\n\u201cThese are the problems we will see next year,\u201d said Torero.",

        "content": "MPs voice deep concerns over trip after mass execution by regime and its continuing role in Yemen war\nBoris Johnson is facing scrutiny over a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to push for an increase in oil output amid an outcry over the regime\u2019s biggest ever mass execution and growing fears the prime minister may try to limit media scrutiny of the visit.\nDowning Street would not confirm Johnson\u2019s likely trip to Riyadh, but sources have said he wants to appeal to the Gulf state to increase its oil output to replace supplies from Russia.\nMPs registered their deep concern after Saudi Arabia\u2019s execution of 81 men on Saturday. Crispin Blunt, a backbench Conservative MP, secured an urgent question in the House of Commons, saying it represented \u201ca new low for human rights and criminal justice in the kingdom, only a week after the crown prince had promised to modernise its justice system.\u201d\nJulian Lewis, the Tory chair of the Commons intelligence and security committee, called on the government to make sure that in seeking to replace energy from Russia with oil from Saudi Arabia it did not create a \u201cdependency on another unreliable and sometimes hostile regime.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, in every country, as a matter of principle, and we routinely raise human rights issues with other countries including Saudi Arabia and will be raising Saturday\u2019s executions with the government in Riyadh.\u201d\nThere are also human rights concerns over Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the war in Yemen, after years of leading a coalition against Iran-backed rebels. More than a dozen UN agencies and international aid groups said on Monday that 161,000 people in the war-torn country were likely to experience famine over the second half of the year \u2013\u2013 a fivefold increase.\nOpposition MPs were even more critical of Johnson\u2019s plans to visit Riyadh. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cIf the prime minister goes in the next few days to Saudi Arabia, we will be sending a very clear signal that we are not that bothered about this kind of thing.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s Nadia Whittome highlighted that the UK had licensed \u00a32bn in arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the beginning of the war in Yemen and called on Johnson to end those sales as well as cancelling the visit.\nThe Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said the government must see the \u201ccontradiction\u201d in moving away from Russian oil to go \u201ccap in hand to another murderous tyrant who executes his own people\u201d and asked the government to rule out a \u201cmore arms for oil\u201d deal with the kingdom.\nDespite No 10 insisting that the prime minister would take the opportunity to raise the issue of human rights, it appears Johnson is unlikely to allow open access to the media on any planned trip.\nPrime ministers have traditionally always allowed UK journalists to accompany them when they travel abroad to meet foreign leaders on overnight stays. But it is expected that any trip by Johnson will be limited to one broadcaster and one journalist from the newswires, known as the \u201cpool\u201d. This has been the arrangement for numerous trips that he has taken to European capitals in recent weeks.\nTheresa May and Gordon Brown both took journalists during very short visits to Saudi Arabia, raising the prospect that No 10 may be trying to set a new precedent in terms of transparency and media scrutiny.\nJohnson has long had a personal relationship with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. In 2018, as foreign secretary, he wrote that Prince Mohammed was a reformer who \u201cdeserves our support,\u201d adding: \u201cI believe that the crown prince, who is only 32, has demonstrated by word and deed that he aims to guide Saudi Arabia in a more open direction.\u201d\nThat was just six months before the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence agencies have since concluded was approved by Prince Mohammed. As a backbencher, Johnson accepted a \u00a314,000 trip to Saudi Arabia from the country\u2019s foreign affairs ministry only a few days before Khashoggi was brutally murdered in the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul.\nLast year the crown prince was revealed to have texted Johnson personally to ask him to intervene to \u201ccorrect\u201d the Premier League\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d decision not to allow a \u00a3300m takeover of Newcastle United by a Saudi-led consortium.\nJohnson asked Edward Lister, the then special envoy for the Gulf, to take up the issue, and Lord Lister reportedly told the prime minister: \u201cI\u2019m on the case. I will investigate.\u201d The government did not have the power to prevent a Premier League decision but the deal eventually went through after undertakings that the Saudi government would not control the club.\nJohnson has been focusing on the impending energy crisis in recent days, holding roundtable talks with oil and gas producers on Monday to discuss ways to increase production in the North Sea.\nThe Treasury has repeatedly ruled out a windfall tax on the companies despite them benefiting from higher oil prices, as the government wants to encourage them to invest more in extraction.",

What if it sank for another reason?\u201d asks a bereaved character whose fiance perished on the \u201cunsinkable\u201d luxury liner in 1912.\nThe what ifs in Ron Hutchinson\u2019s drama explore the psychological effects of fake news spawned in the wake of the disaster, specifically the theory that the American financier JP Morgan orchestrated the sinking of the ship to kill off his enemies. It is a zany idea for a play, even if it lies on the outer realms of conspiracy theory.\nEmma (Genevieve Gaunt), a young British woman mourning the loss of her beau, arrives in New York to unearth hidden facts herself and coincidentally meets a jaded newspaper hack, Molloy (John Hopkins). He promptly offers to help her in order to sell her story to the papers and early scenes alternate between their meeting and his exchanges with his editor (Lizzy McInnerny) who \u2013 again coincidentally \u2013 lost her own lover in the maritime disaster.\nUnder the direction of Eoin O\u2019Callaghan, this set-up promises a corporate murder mystery as Emma and Molloy begin their investigations. A ship engineer (Fergal McElherron) speaks of structural failures in the Titanic\u2019s design and warns: \u201cAsk the wrong questions and you get a hatchet in the head.\u201d\nBut as competent as the performances are, this play goes nowhere dramatically. Instead, it swims around in exposition, with flimsy, cliched characters and little beyond theories being spoken out loud. Its action \u2013 what little there is \u2013 feels static, almost sleepy, despite the colourful premise, and we can hear the creaks of its plot turns.\nIt is touching that Hutchinson dedicates the play to his grandfather, a shipfitter on the Titanic who died from injuries sustained in the shipyard. It is also ambitious in its intention to bring together the idea of fake news with psychoanalytic aspects of reality, fantasy and neurosis (Freud\u2019s \u201cnew science\u201d is briefly mentioned). But it does not succeed in exploring this ground with any depth or coherence, and it never becomes clear what it is ultimately trying to say.\nGhosts of the Titanic is at Park theatre, London, until 2 April.",

It was to be a flagship bill signalling to the world that post-Brexit Britain was a world leader in animal rights, legislating against animal cruelty abroad. Most significantly, it included a commitment to ban the import of endangered animal parts.\nBut over the weekend it emerged that the bill was no longer likely to be implemented. Government sources said it had been scrapped, and that manifesto commitments including the trophy hunting import ban would no longer take place in this parliament. The government has officially blamed a lack of parliamentary time to implement the bill, elements of which were promised in the 2019 Conservative manifesto.\nMinisters have blamed lobbying from the traditional wing of the party for No 10\u2019s change of heart over the bill. A senior government source said: \u201cA handful of crusties have managed to seize control. A handful of very wealthy peers are pressing for all the animal welfare measures to be dropped because they fear eventually it might mean their weekends could be affected.\u201d\nSome within the Conservative party believe, according to this source, that trophy-hunting animal rights activists will say that it is hypocritical to legislate based on nature-depleting action abroad, when shooting weekends are still allowed in the UK.\nConservative MPs have called on Boris Johnson to keep the bill alive and implement it as soon as possible.\nSir Roger Gale, a member of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which counts the prime minister\u2019s wife, Carrie Johnson, as a patron, spoke out on Monday.\nHe said: \u201cThere is absolutely no place for trophy hunting in the civilised modern world. There is an infinitely better living for those in developing countries to be made out of photo tourism, the photographing of living wild animals, then there ever has been in murdering those animals simply to bring their body parts home and stick them on a wall. That is why trophy hunting has to be banned, and it has to be banned now\u201d.\nLord Benyon, an environment minister, has said it will be \u201cdebated when parliamentary time allows\u201d.\nNew polling from Survation, commissioned by the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, has found that 92% of Conservative supporters are in favour of a ban on imports of endangered animal hunting trophies.\nEduardo Goncalves, of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: \u201cDropping a bill backed by 92% of your party\u2019s supporters is baffling, to say the least. Aside from it being a broken manifesto commitment, it doesn\u2019t look good when the prime minister and the Queen tell MPs the ban is going ahead, only to mysteriously axe it for no good reason.\n\u201cOne can only hope this is some terrible misunderstanding and that Boris Johnson will move quickly to clarify matters. If, as is expected, there is a new Queen\u2019s speech in May, then it is imperative that the trophy ban is included within it. The patience of many Tory voters is fraying. Animal welfare issues can be strong drivers of voting intention. If the Conservatives go back on this commitment, they can expect it to come back to haunt them.\u201d\nThose in the shooting lobby have welcomed the news that the bill has been delayed.\nChristopher Graffius, executive director of communications and public affairs at the British Association of Shooting and Conservation, said: \u201cThere is much good in the animals abroad bill that everyone who cares for animals and the countryside will support, but there are areas of the bill such as banning the importation of trophies from sustainable and regulated hunting which are not evidence based and will damage conservation.\n\u201cWith limited parliamentary time produced by a heavy legislative agenda and war in Ukraine, the withdrawal of the bill allows for further consideration and improvement before its resubmitted to parliament.\u201d",

        "content": "Majority of victims of Islamophobia are women, with a fourfold increase in reported incidents after terrorist attack\nThe Christchurch massacre triggered a surge of hate towards Muslim people in Australia, with women the vast majority of victims, a report has found.\nThe Islamophobia Register Australia (IRA) recorded a fourfold increase in reports of in person incidents of anti-Muslim hate, while reports of online incidents were 18 times higher in the two weeks after 15 March 2019, when an Australian white supremacist, Brenton Tarrant, murdered 51 people in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\nThe third report of its kind, Islamophobia in Australia III draws on verified incidents of anti-Muslim hate in Australia in 2018 and 2019.\nIncidents recorded include that of a patient in the chair of a Muslim dentist calling all Muslims \u201cterrorists\u201d, a family physically assaulting a woman at the zoo, and a pregnant woman being punched repeatedly by a stranger in a cafe \u2013 a case that made news at the time.\nReleased on Tuesday by Charles Sturt University and the Islamic Science and Research Academy, the latest report analyses 247 incidents of Islamophobia across 2018 and 2019, 138 of which occurred in person, 109 online.\nAnti-Muslim hate is deeply gendered, the data shows, with women comprising 82% of in-person victims \u2013 up from \u200b\u200b72% in the second report and 68% in the first. Of those women, 85% were wearing hijab and 48% were alone when the attacks occurred, while 15% of them were accompanied by children. Most of the perpetrators \u2013 74% \u2013 were male.\nSecurity guards or cameras did not make Muslims any safer, the data suggested, as there was \u201cno meaningful correlation\u201d between the existence of cameras and guards and the severity of an incident.\nIncidents recorded by the IRA also demonstrated that \u201canti-Muslim hate breaches social and professional hierarchies\u201d.\nThe report\u2019s lead researcher, Dr Derya Iner, said the sample of incidents was \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, noting that hate crime was vastly underreported internationally and the register\u2019s ability to collect data depended on the community\u2019s awareness of it.\n\u201cWe are not saying that this report represents everything in Australia, but this is a good sample to show manifestations of Islamophobia across Australia,\u201d Iner said.\nMuslims were associated with terrorism or portrayed as killers in 12% of cases over the first reporting period (2014-2016), but that number has risen sharply, with 39% of incidents making that association in this most recent report.\n\u201cI think this is the impact of online far-right groups. To bring people to that level of intense hate, you need to have a good excuse, and the best excuse is associating Muslims with terrorism and portraying them as killers,\u201d Iner said, noting that this was one of the most common narratives online about Muslims after the Christchurch massacre.\nIn the wake of Christchurch, 40% of reported online posts, mostly on Facebook, included threats to kill Muslims, with 55% of those threatening mass killing.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nOf the in-person incidents, which included both verbal and physical attacks, 63% occurred in commonly frequented places like shopping centres or on public transport.\n\u201cMuslims are attacked, harassed, among people in crowds. There is not enough social pressure on perpetrators to deter them, to prevent them doing it,\u201d Iner said.\n\u201cHate culture is accommodated by silence. Bystanders are around, but silent.\u201d\nZainab Sajjad Haider, who reported an incident of Islamophobia to the register in 2019, told Guardian Australia that for every incident she reported, there would be \u201cdozens\u201d more that she didn\u2019t.\nHaider, born in Tamworth, converted to Islam in 2015 while in her mid-20s. Now 31, she said the change in how she was treated once she embraced her faith was profound.\n\u201cI\u2019m a white Australian, but I lost my white privilege by putting on the hijab,\u201d Haider said.\nHaider holds a veteran\u2019s card, as she had been training as a recruit in the Australian Defence Force before an injury prevented her from progressing with a military career.\nAfter converting, she began carrying the veteran\u2019s card with her whenever she left the house, \u201cjust in case someone came up to me\u201d.\n\u201cI found that was my get out of jail free card. That was my buffer. I remember once I was getting abused in a car park and I got out the card and threw it in this guy\u2019s face like, \u2018can you read?\u2019 and he was like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\u201cObviously as a Muslim I don\u2019t agree with our foreign policies any more, if I ever did,\u201d Haidar said, noting the irony of her situation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because the narrative of invading Afghanistan was \u2018saving the women\u2019, but usually the people who attack you here are tradies. Generally, it\u2019s blokes. If men experience Islamophobia, usually it\u2019s racism first. It\u2019s only Islamophobia first if they\u2019re very visibly Muslim.\n\u201cBut with women, it\u2019s always Islam first.\u201d\nThe incident Haider reported to the IRA occurred on a train in Melbourne, when a man hissed, spat at, and verbally abused her. When the man alighted the train, she reported the incident to the protective services officers at that station, only to discover the perpetrator was notorious for harassing Muslim women.\n\u201cIn Melbourne, it was only ever public transport where I was a target,\u201d Haider said. \u201cEvery Anzac Day, Australia Day, I would try not to go into public \u2013 I would try not to be on public transport on those holidays that I know have a nationalism aspect, even though I\u2019ve served in the army. I know I\u2019m a target every time.\u201d\nThe report\u2019s recommendations include social media companies taking more responsibility for online hate, political leadership in standing up against hate, and clearer legal consequences for online platforms and perpetrators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Muslim people\u2019s problem; it\u2019s a society-wide problem. It can be countered by bystanders but also by systemic change,\u201d Iner said.",

He also called for an expanded network of net-free zones along the length of the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s coasts.\nThough the licences WWF has bought would \u201cnever be used for commercial gill net fishing again\u201d, it hoped to hand them over to traditional owners on the Cape for \u201csustainable fishing\u201d practices such as line or mud crabbing, or to generate income from charters.\nThe organisation is understood to have paid Riesenweber an amount at the lower end of six figures for his licence.\nRiesenweber mainly sought to catch barramundi with the gill net, which he said he used on or around river mouths and areas with muddy or sandy bottoms.\nThe fisher described the WFF\u2019s offer as a rare case of \u201csomeone outside doing something positive\u201d for an industry which he said had been abandoned by the government.\n\u201cThey are trying to stand with the industry, in a lot of respects,\u201d Riesenweber said of WWF.\n\u201cSo at least some fishermen can get out with a bit of dignity.\u201d\nConservationists describe gill nets as \u201cwalls of death\u201d, but Riesenweber disputed the characterisation of them as indiscriminate killers. He said commercial operators had a vested interest in sustainable fishing, but described selling his licence as \u201ca compromise\u201d.\n\u201cThey wanted it, they had a good reason for it and they gave me an offer that I considered reasonable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all want the same result at the end of day \u2026 what we gotta do is understand everyone\u2019s point of view.\n\u201cYou never trust your enemy, but you can understand them.\u201d\nThe 68-year-old said he would continue to commercially line fish on the outer reefs, but was concerned about rising fuel prices and seafood imports.\nRiesenweber said his grandfather had fished Moreton Bay and his dad had died on a trawler in 1971.\n\u201cWhen I retire I want to be able to buy fresh Australian fish,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the way we are heading is we won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nLeck said WWF supported sustainable fishing on the reef \u2013 commercial and recreational.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that still, within the World Heritage area, we have a number of poor fishing practices and a lot of room for improvement of fisheries management,\u201d Leck said.\nRiesenweber\u2019s is the fourth gill net licence bought by WWF on the reef. Two were bought primarily to protect dugongs, two others for hammerhead sharks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not normal practice for a conservation organisation to buy and shelve commercial net fishing licences,\u201d Leck said.\n\u201cBut it was a practical way to remove the threat of gill nets from a section of the reef [that is] incredibly important for threatened species.\u201d\nWWF has focused on the northern section of the reef as it has the highest proportion of threatened marine wildlife, with the area north of Cape Flattery home to about 7,000 dugongs and 282,000 large juvenile and adult turtles.\nLeck said there was no formal recording of the entanglement and drowning of threatened marine species in nets. But WWF points to recent marine deaths they say demonstrate the dangers of gill nets.\nIn September 2018, six sawfish and two dugongs washed up on a beach south of Townsville. All were believed killed by gill nets.\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s nature needs us now more than ever,\u201d Leck said.",

        "content": "Exclusive: 70% of discretionary funds from the then deputy premier went to Coalition seats\nFormer New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro directed millions of dollars in grants to Coalition electorates, many of them at-risk National party seats, from a discretionary pool of funds which have almost no departmental oversight.\nAn analysis of discretionary grants handed out by Barilaro during the past three years shows that 70% of the $3m spent went to Coalition seats.\nRecipients have included his successor in the seat of Monaro, Nichole Overall, as well as the NRL and a soccer club where Barilaro was president for eight years.\nIn particular, the use of discretionary funds in seats in the lead-up to elections has raised questions about how the grants operate, and a lack of oversight by government departments.\nIn some cases, recipients said they were asked by Barilaro himself to submit funding requests to his office.\nIn the lead up to last May\u2019s Upper Hunter byelection, the Nationals made some $120m in funding promises as it successfully held the seat after the resignation of former MP Michael Johnsen. Among them were a series of significant announcements, including $45m for an upgrade of the Muswellbrook hospital and $12m for a police station in the town of Singleton.\nBut the pre-election spend also included a series of grants to local organisations that were not subject to departmental advice, or recommendations.\nThe Upper Hunter received $340,000 in grants from Barilaro in the last financial year, about a fifth of the total money distributed under a fund known as the deputy premier\u2019s discretionary or miscellaneous fund.\nAmong the grants were $200,000 given to the Muswellbrook Golf Club in the weeks leading up to the vote. The grant followed a separate $1m payment in 2019, and was announced by Barilaro just days before the byelection.\nClub president Daryl Egan told the Guardian a cost blowout meant the course needed additional funding to complete work on the project, and that he raised the prospect of securing the money while Barilaro was in town during the byelection campaign.\n\u201cWe were talking to the deputy premier and he asked how it was going and I told him that, yes, because of Covid and a few other things the cost had increased,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nEgan said he was asked to write a letter explaining the need for the additional funding and that it had been secured \u201cwithin a few weeks\u201d. The funding was not without any requirements \u2013 Egan said that after the money was provided the club was required to provide evidence to the department showing what it had been spent on \u2013 but did not require a formal grant application.\nSimilarly, in the weeks leading up to the vote Barilaro announced a $100,000 grant to a local networking organisation called Upper Hunter Women in Business.\nThe funds were to be delivered over two separate years. The group\u2019s founder, Lavinia Hutchinson, did not respond to a request for comment, but in April when the grant was awarded she told a local news site that Barilaro had offered the group funding in the lead up to the byelection.\n\u201cWe got a phone call today from John basically asking if we would like some funding \u2026 he said \u2018how\u2019s $100,000 sound?\u2019,\u201d Hutchinson said at the time.\nBarilaro was quoted in the same report saying: \u201cThis is not an election commitment, regardless of the election it is me as deputy premier supporting what I believe is a very worthy organisation.\u201d\nBarilaro did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.\nLabor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, accused the Nationals of doing \u201ctheir best Santa Claus impression\u201d during the byelection.\n\u201cThey gave what they want, to whom they wanted, whenever they wanted to,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOther communities missed out as the government doled on public funds to save their skins in a tightly fought byelection.\u201d\nThat pattern has been repeated elsewhere. At the previous state election in 2019 the Nationals party was fighting to hold on to a series of seats including Lismore, Barwon and Murray, while also hoping to win back Ballina, which it lost to the Greens in 2015.\nOf the almost $870,000 in total grants awarded by Barilaro during that year, about a fifth went to those four seats. They included a $26,000 grant to a gym in the seat of Murray two weeks before the election, as well as a series of larger grants to local councils. In Ballina, a $25,700 grant for the Lennox Head Surf Club was announced four months before the 2019 election by Nationals\u2019 candidate in the seat Ben Franklin.\nOf the rest of the funds distributed that year, only two grants valued at $35,000 went to organisations based in non-government seats, although some were directed to larger organisations not based in a particular electorate.\nThe NSW government has faced repeated controversy over its use of grant funding in recent years. In February the auditor general released a scathing report into a $252m grant scheme which directed more than 95% of funds to local councils in government seats. The fund, the auditor found, \u201clacked integrity\u201d and did not use any consistent guidelines in awarding grants.\nBut unlike those programs, the deputy premier\u2019s discretionary grants aren\u2019t subject to vetting, and government departments don\u2019t make formal recommendations about the benefits of the funding.\nInstead, as the name suggests, the grants are entirely at the discretion of the minister.\nIn March last year, Chris Hanger, a senior official in the Department of Regional NSW, told a parliamentary inquiry that approvals for money from the discretionary grant pool only require an email from a ministerial adviser to gain signoff.\n \nEmail:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\nApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest stories\nSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0Twitter\nPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\nIt was, Hanger said, the only fund of its type overseen by his department.\nDesigned to allow the deputy premier to fund \u201csmall-scale\u201d community projects that would otherwise struggle to gain financial support, some of the money has also been directed to larger private organisations.\nLast year, one of the largest grants handed out under the fund was $50,000 given to the NRL to help fund the multi-billion dollar code\u2019s \u201croads to regions\u201d program.\nThe program, according to a spokesperson for current deputy premier Paul Toole, was aimed at allowing former NRL stars and NRLW players to travel to regional areas to run \u201ceducational programs in schools, visit junior rugby league clubs and take part in local community events\u201d.\nAccording to the NRL, though, the program\u2019s aim was to \u201csupport and empower rugby league communities where no NRL club engagement is present\u201d in order to \u201cgrow the game\u201d not only in NSW but also Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.\nIt was the second time the program had received funds from the deputy premier. In 2018, Barilaro directed another $40,000 to the NRL for the same purpose. Last year another $130,000 was given separately to the league under the government\u2019s drought stimulus fund.\nThat funding, which Barilaro also oversaw, was allocated to play a match in Tamworth to \u201cbolster community morale and support drought recovery\u201d.\nThe government refused to answer repeated questions about how grants are chosen under the scheme, and how potential applicants are informed about the availability of discretionary grant funds.\nBut other grants have also raised eyebrows. In 2018, Barilaro awarded $5,000 to Nichole Overall, a Queanbeyan-based journalist and author, to support a local art installation.\nOverall, whose husband, Tim Overall, was until recently mayor of Queanbeyan and once sat on the council with Barilaro, replaced him as the Monaro state MP at last month\u2019s byelection. She did not respond to a request for comment.\nOverall did not respond to a request for comment.\nBarilaro also handed two grants to the Monaro Panthers, a football club where he was president for eight years prior to his election to parliament.\nThe two grants \u2013 for $30,000 in 2018/19 and $10,000 in 2020/21 \u2013 went to upgrades to toilets, stadium seating, and female dressing rooms at the club, as well as support for a youth football tournament.\nIt followed $78,000 in funds he allocated the club under the now defunct Community Building Partnerships in 2013 prior to becoming Nationals leader. At the time, Barilaro faced criticism for his failure to declare a conflict of interest over the grant, which he dismissed because he was not an office bearer at the club when the money was awarded.\nDiscretionary funds aren\u2019t new. The premier has his own fund which has existed since 1998, and money allocated from it has fluctuated significantly in that time. In 2010/11, during the final year of the former Labor government, $14.2m was signed off on from the fund.\nIt was only after Barry O\u2019Farrell\u2019s election in 2011 that money from the fund was made consistent at $2.3m per annum.",

My mum\u2019s name is Larbalestier and I am just about to put that in my name.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really fully understand the whole idea that when people get married the woman loses her name and I really want my mum\u2019s name to continue on with the Hamilton name.\u201d\nAsked when he anticipated the change would take place, Hamilton said: \u201cHopefully soon.

After all, they\u2019d surely pick up six points from their matches in the Goodison cauldron against Wolves and Newcastle, whereupon any notions of impending relegation would become fanciful and the chance to riff, bebop and scat on Frank Lampard\u2019s pain would be gone. The mental gymnastics we have to perform, eh, readers? We go to these extra lengths just for you. You deserve it. Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, right?\nHowever, as we watched the blood drain from Lampard\u2019s face yesterday afternoon, supporters segueing seamlessly from supportive cheering to booing to a crisp, clear snatch of You\u2019re Not Fit To Wear The Shirt, we began to wonder if the unthinkable was starting to occur in plain sight in front of our very eyes. We\u2019ve seen that grey, glazed expression of confused impotence on Merseyside before \u2013 Mike Walker, Roy Hodgson, Jimmy Corkhill \u2013 and it rarely ends well. The miserable 1-0 defeat to Wolves means the Ev are now only out of the relegation places on goal difference, with rejuvenated 18th-placed Watford breathing down their necks, and the aforementioned Hodgson, merely by adding a pair of wire spectacles, now transformed into a windswept romantic with a vague similarity to late-era WB Yeats.

Everton still have matches in hand on those around them at the bottom, but should they fail to pick up all three points later this week against a Newcastle team suddenly good enough to give the European and world champions a game, that might not count for too much, because the rest of that run-in is testing, to say the very least.

Antonio Conte said on Saturday that it was a very difficult atmosphere for them to play and that\u2019s probably one of the biggest compliments you can get: if the opposition manager says that after the game.\u201d\nAlex Telles echoed Rangnick\u2019s sentiment. \u201cThe support is extremely important,\u201d said the Brazilian defender. \u201cIf we play well the fans will always be behind us. We feel that when we\u2019re at home. We have fantastic fans \u2013 they\u2019re very positive and we react positively to that. It\u2019s how it was against Spurs and I think it will be the same against Atl\u00e9tico: we\u2019re really happy with the fans.\u201d\nBruno Fernandes is set to return, having missed the Spurs win because of Covid. He has now tested negative. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why he could train today,\u201d Rangnick said. \u201cAs it is right now we have all the players available tomorrow. There\u2019s a small question mark over Luke Shaw \u2013 he was training yesterday and today. We have to wait and see if he\u2019s fully fit to be available for the game. All the other players are back in training and available.\u201d\nThe Champions League is the last competition United can win this season, and Rangnick is intent that they progress to the next round to match the club\u2019s status as three-times winners. \u201cFor us it\u2019s about our own sporting ambition \u2013 we\u2019re highly ambitious and we want to proceed and show we can compete with the best teams in Europe,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have a fantastic opportunity to be in the top eight teams of Europe if we beat them on Tuesday and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to achieve. The game against Tottenham showed the level we can play and with another 10 or 20% on top of that I\u2019m sure we can win.\u201d\nRegarding Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a hat-trick against Spurs, Rangnick has no concerns about the 37-year-old having to play again only 72 hours later. \u201cI\u2019m not worried that he has not been able to recover,\u201d the 63-year-old said. \u201cSo far he\u2019s always been a person who looks after himself and his body and he knows what to do. I\u2019m not worried about that.\n\u201cIf he can score another three, we will see. It\u2019s not so easy to score three goals against this team at all. His overall performance was good if not even very good [against Spurs] and this is what we hope to get from him again tomorrow night. He\u2019s still a very important player for this team and it will be good for us if he has a similar performance to the one against Tottenham.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Cristiano \u2013 it\u2019s about the whole team. We saw in the first half in Madrid [when conceding after seven minutes] what we shouldn\u2019t do and how we should not play and this was obviously a big topic for us yesterday and today when we spoke about the game. We have to know what it takes tactically and then the rest is about energy.\n\u201cWe had a team against Spurs that just wanted to win that game, and it became obvious. The supporters played a vital role because they realised how much we wanted to win that game and tomorrow will be similar.\u201d",

        "content": "For the first mile or so Christopher Mallaby walked and stumbled through a maze of British rocks and puddles into the still raw and unfinished Channel tunnel. Then he got on to a makeshift buggy for the next 35 miles. The final mile he completed on foot to emerge in Calais as the new British ambassador to France. It had been Christopher\u2019s idea to inaugurate his ambassadorship there in 1993 by becoming the first diplomat ever to make a land journey from Britain to the European mainland.\nChristopher, who has died aged 85, was one of Britain\u2019s pre-eminent postwar diplomats. From 1960 to 1996 he was at the centre of diplomatic activity surrounding the end of the cold war and German reunification.\nFluent in French, German and Russian, he was a fledgling diplomat in Moscow during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. He was back in Moscow in a senior position from 1975 to 1977, a period when the adoption of the Helsinki accords was beginning to help east-west relations, and from henceforth always landed in the right postings, either in the Russian capital, London or Bonn \u2013 later moving to Berlin \u2013 to help steer British policy as cold war tensions eased.\nAs British ambassador (1988-92) in what was initially West Germany when the Berlin Wall came down, Christopher was an early convert to reunification and had the courage to be blunt with Margaret Thatcher over her unrealistic opposition to a united Germany. He battled hard to reconcile her to that inevitability, which, when it came in 1990, prompted crucial discussions about the future role of Nato.\nIn his memoir, Living the Cold War (2017), he gave an account of the diplomatic manoeuvring at that time, which Vladimir Putin is now exploiting to justify Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Christopher wrote that the US secretary of state, James Baker, \u201ctold Mikhail Gorbachev in early February 1990 that the borders of Nato would not move further eastward than united Germany. He offered a guarantee on this on the assumption that Gorbachev would agree that Nato would continue to exist and US forces would be stationed in Europe under Nato.\u201d Christopher added that Helmut Kohl of Germany and the then prime minister, John Major, gave the Russians a similar undertaking.\nHowever, the US president, George HW Bush, \u201cimmediately decided that this undertaking should not be made\u201d. Gorbachev did not ask for a written record of these exchanges and the way was left open for dangerous controversy. As he observed at the time of his memoir, \u201ca truculent Putin and the Russian people now see themselves as surrounded by a truculent west \u2026 and believe that the west wants to add Ukraine to Nato\u201d.\nWhile Christopher recognised the dangers of expanding Nato into the Baltics and eastern Europe, he nevertheless concluded it would give them essential security guarantees against Russia.\nBorn in London, Christopher came from a military family and was only nine years old when his father, Maj Gen Aubertin Mallaby, was assassinated in Indonesia. His mother, Margaret (nee Jones), his brother, Anthony, and sister, Sue, were left in straitened circumstances, but both boys were awarded bursaries to go to Eton.\nAfter a stint of national service that took Christopher for his first extended stay in West Germany, he spent three years at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, initially studying French and German before turning to modern history.\nThe army experience taught Christopher that he did not want to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. In search of another form of public service, he turned to the Foreign Office, where in 1959 he passed the entrance exams with flying colours. He had found his metier.\nHe had also found the love of his life, Pascale Thierry-Mieg, and they married shortly before going to Moscow in 1961.\nHis first contact with cold war diplomacy came in 1960, when he was posted to the United Nations during the general assembly, where east-west tensions were on full display. He continued to be in the right place as a 23-year-old junior in Moscow, when he was conveniently at hand to replace an interpreter during a British businessman\u2019s conversation with the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev.\nHe was London-based as head of policy planning (1980-82) when he was asked to coordinate Foreign Office work on the Falklands crisis and had his first direct contact with Thatcher. He worked with the prime minister again during the negotiation of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.\nThe three years of his final posting, as ambassador in Paris, gave him ample scope for promoting Anglo-French cooperation. He had considerable access to presidents Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, and a kaleidoscopic cross-section of French society was invited to the palatial embassy. The former health minister and Auschwitz survivor Simone Veil became a close friend. Pamela Harriman, the US ambassador, would slip through the garden gate between the two embassies for informal chats.\nChristopher was managing director of what became UBS Investment Bank (2000-06), had a four-year term as chairman of Somerset House Trust, and six years as a trustee of the Tate. He also served as deputy chairman of Reuters (1998-2013), and chairman of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (2001-13).\nKnighted in 1996, he made lasting friendships in every post. \u201cI loved almost every moment of my career,\u201d he wrote in his memoir.\nPascale died in 2020. Christopher is survived by a son, Sebastian, and three daughters, Emily, Julia and Charlotte.\n Christopher Leslie George Mallaby, diplomat, born 7 July 1936; died 28 February 2022",

        "content": "As the coup against President Salvador Allende in Chile unfolded on 11 September 1973, Hugh O\u2019Shaughnessy was one of the few foreign correspondents in the capital, Santiago, and was able to give an eyewitness account of the seizure of power by the armed forces, and the death of the president.\nForty years later, O\u2019Shaughnessy recalled that he walked back to his hotel through the deserted streets, hands in the air, to find Pinochet\u2019s rich supporters already celebrating victory: \u201cThey whooped as he announced on television the closing down of congress, the political parties, the trade unions and the judges.\u201d\nIn order to report as a freelance journalist on Latin America, O\u2019Shaughnessy, who has died aged 87, had taken the typically bold step of uprooting his family to the Chilean capital in 1966, when he first met and became friends with Allende, then the Socialist party leader. O\u2019Shaughnessy\u2019s view that the 1973 coup was engineered by the US made him a trenchant critic of that country\u2019s role in Latin America from then on.\nIn October 1983 he again found himself at the centre of events on the island of Grenada in the Caribbean when US forces moved in to overthrow the revolutionary government \u2013 the only occasion when there was direct confrontation between US and Cuban troops. He later published a book about his experiences there: Grenada: Revolution, Invasion and Aftermath (1984).\nFor 30 years, O\u2019Shaughnessy seemed to appear everywhere, from Argentina to Mexico, usually properly suited and booted, and taking advantage of his vast network of friends and contacts to send perceptive reports back for the Financial Times, and in later years the Observer and the Guardian, as well as being a regular contributor to the Tablet, the Catholic weekly.\nA lifelong Catholic, he also wrote regularly about the church, in particular its poor record on human rights in Argentina, Chile and elsewhere. He was a staunch supporter of the leftwing clergy in Nicaragua\u2019s revolutionary Sandinista government, and of Oscar Romero, archbishop of El Salvador, and wrote a biography of Fernando Lugo, the Roman Catholic bishop who was president of Paraguay from 2008 until 2012 (The Priest of Paraguay: Fernando Lugo and the Making of a Nation, 2009).\nAt the same time, he was scathing in his contempt for more reactionary elements in the church, such as Marcial Maciel Degollado, the founder of the Legionaries of Christ, whom he memorably described thus: \u201cThe pushy Mexican priest [was] the bisexual pederast, drug-addicted lover of several women and father of three who hoodwinked a succession of popes.\u201d\nBorn in Reading, Hugh was the only child of Irish immigrants. His father, Charles O\u2019Shaughnessy, worked as a porter at the Home Office, and his mother, Mary (nee Donovan), was an administrative assistant. Evacuated during the second world war to stay with cousins in Cork, Hugh developed during his years there a love of Ireland and the Irish that remained with him all his life. When he returned to England at the end of the war, his family was living in Chiswick, west London; Hugh was educated at the Catholic St Benedict\u2019s school in Ealing, and subsequently at Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied modern languages and met Georgina Alliston (Georgie), whom he married in 1961.\nAfter national service and a short spell working for Rowntree\u2019s in York, he was determined to use his language skills to pursue a career as a journalist, in particular in Latin America. The 1970s was a decade of brutal dictatorships throughout the region, and O\u2019Shaughnessy reported from many of the countries where grave human rights abuses were being committed.\nHe was equally active in Latin American affairs when in Britain. He worked with Amnesty International and other organisations helping refugees from Chile, Argentina and other countries. A stalwart of the Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR), he was one of the founders of the Latin America Bureau, a charity promoting the defence of human rights and social justice in the region. He later helped launch the Latin American Newsletters, an influential weekly series of newsletters analysing events throughout the area.\nSomehow he also found time to write a series of books, perhaps most notably Latin Americans (1988); Around the Spanish Main: Travels in the Caribbean and the Guianas (1991); and Pinochet: The Politics of Torture (1999), written at the time of the Chilean dictator\u2019s arrest in London.\nOne of his most moving articles was written following the death of Georgie, his wife of \u201c50 years and 36 hours\u201d, of a brain tumour in 2011. In it, he spoke of the magnificent care offered by NHS doctors and nurses, but bemoaned how the service was being privatised even then: \u201cIt seemed bizarre that the NHS was manoeuvred by an aggressive privatisation lobby into accepting a clearly inferior service from a company run from a country incapable of organising a health service for its own citizens.\u201d\nO\u2019Shaughnessy won two British Press awards, the 1986 Maria Moors Cabot prize for journalistic contributions to inter-American understanding, and the Wilberforce Medallion from the city of Hull. Yet he was perhaps most proud of the honours that he received from Michelle Bachelet during her periods as president of Chile, in recognition of his support for its people during the years of repression.\nIn his final years he suffered from increasingly poor health, but remained typically active and sociable.\nHis son Thomas died in 1985. He is survived by his children Frances, Matthew and Luke.\n  Hugh O\u2019Shaughnessy, journalist and writer, born 21 January 1935; died 1 March 2022\n This article was amended on 15 March 2022. O\u2019Shaughnessy married in 1961, not 1937 as stated in an earlier version.",

A bipartisan Senate report said seven deaths were connected to the assault on Congress which followed.\nThomas said brief attendance at the rally was the full extent of her involvement.\n\u201cI was disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering of Trump supporters on the Ellipse on 6 January,\u201d she told the Free Beacon, a conservative site.\nInvestigations by the New York Times and the New Yorker have raised questions about Thomas\u2019s ties to organizers of the January 6 rally.\nAccording to the Times, Thomas sits on the board of a rightwing group that circulated \u201caction steps\u201d after the 2020 election, in an attempt to keep Trump in power.\nOne of the organizers of the rally told the Times that Thomas was a peacekeeper between various factions. Thomas denied those allegations.\n\u201cI played no role with those who were planning and leading the 6 January events,\u201d she said.\nThe Times told the Free Beacon it stood by its \u201cfair and accurate\u201d reporting.\nThomas, who has been involved in conservative activism for decades, also categorically rejected any suggestion her political activities present a conflict of interest for her husband. Some judicial ethics experts have called on Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving causes with which his wife has been involved.\nHowever, Ginni Thomas\u2019s comments on the morning of 6 January only intensified questions about her husband\u2019s possible conflicts of interest.\nIn a series of Facebook posts that are no longer visible, Thomas said \u201cLOVE MAGA people!!!!\u201d and \u201cGOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING!\u201d\nShe later added a note that the posts were written before the attack on the Capitol, according to Slate.\nThomas has insisted her activism has no bearing on her husband\u2019s rulings, saying they have kept their careers separate since he was confirmed in 1991.\n\u201cLike so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America,\u201d Thomas told the Free Beacon. \u201cBut we have our own separate careers and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn\u2019t discuss his work with me and I don\u2019t involve him in my work.\u201d\nJustice Thomas\u2019s critics will closely scrutinize his work related to the Capitol attack.\nIn January, he provided an early hint about his opinion of efforts to investigate January 6. The supreme court rejected Trump\u2019s request to stop a House select committee accessing his White House records.\nOnly one justice dissented: Clarence Thomas.",

        "content": "Labour leader was invited to visit a church with Standard owner but declined to be pictured alongside him\nKeir Starmer turned down a lengthy photo opportunity with Evgeny Lebedev shortly after he became Labour leader, the Guardian can reveal, with aides citing a desire to keep the Russian businessman at arm\u2019s length.\nStarmer, the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in north London, was invited to spend the day with the proprietor of the Evening Standard and the Independent during the first months of the Covid pandemic.\nThe invitation in June 2020 involved a planned visit to a church in Kensington, where Starmer would be greeted by Lord Lebedev and see the church\u2019s efforts to feed homeless people. The pair were to prepare meals with volunteer chefs and hand out packed lunches together.\nStarmer\u2019s team turned down the offer to be pictured alongside Lebedev, though said they were prepared to send a supportive quote.\nSources said the invitation had been extended after a Zoom meeting with Standard staff where the possibility of a visit was initially raised with Starmer.\nLebedev, the son of a former KGB agent, was given a peerage by Boris Johnson, who has insisted he is not a security risk. Johnson denied he intervened to secure a peerage for Lebedev after intelligence services had warned it would be a security risk, after reports in the Guardian and Sunday Times.\nLebedev has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called on Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops. \u201cAt the moment many with Russian roots are under scrutiny, including myself,\u201d Lebedev wrote. \u201cI understand the reason for this as it is inevitable when events of such magnitude occur and the world order as we have known it in recent decades suddenly gets torn up.\u201d\nLebedev, who joined the House of Lords in November 2020 as a crossbencher, said he was \u201cnot a security risk to this country, which I love\u201d and that while his father had been a KGB agent, he was \u201cnot some agent of Russia\u201d.\n\u201cBeing Russian does not automatically make one an enemy of the state, and it is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,\u201d Lebedev said.\nThough he has said he is not supportive of the Kremlin regime, Lebedev has used some of his public profile to question the British line on matters related to Russia, including tweets that raised whether the defector Alexander Litvinenko was \u201cmurdered by MI6\u201d, quoting a Mail article.\nIn 2014 he told Andrew Marr that Crimea had been \u201cfor many years\u201d part of Russia and that \u201cRussia has reached out to the west and I think now it\u2019s time to stop cold war rhetoric on both sides\u201d. In 2015 he wrote that the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, was better for the west\u2019s \u201csecurity and interests\u201d, adding: \u201cOn this point I am emphatically with Putin.\u201d\nStarmer, a former director of public prosecutions, wrote to Lord Bew, the chair of the House of Lords appointments commission, to ask him to reassess the peerage.\n\u201cFor Boris Johnson to nominate to the House of Lords someone who has promoted the worst conspiracy theories and defences of Vladimir Putin shows just how flawed the prime minister\u2019s judgment is,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe accusations made by Lord Lebedev that the British security services had any involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is insulting. I have seen first-hand the real impact of Russian interference in Britain and the difficulties prosecutors encounter when dealing with those who act on behalf of Putin. This is a clearly a matter of national security.\u201d\nLabour politicians have been courted by Lebedev in the past. Ed Miliband attended a party thrown by the mogul at Lebedev\u2019s house in west London to mark the launch of London Live.\nTony Blair and Gordon Brown have also attended his events, with Blair interviewed by Lebedev personally for a piece in the Independent. Brown\u2019s wife, Sarah, attended a black-tie fundraiser hosted by Lebedev.\nLebedev has been approached for comment.",

The time of Teahupoo\u2019s recent Grade Three win at Gowran Park suggests the form is stronger than it might have looked.\nHoneysuckle (3.30), though, still has something to spare on form and gets the 7lb mares\u2019 allowance too. The odds are short, but a win under Rachael Blackmore to elevate her further among the hurdling greats will be something to savour.\n1.30 The \u201cbig three\u201d in the market are unbeaten in seven starts over hurdles and closely matched on form and ratings. Dysart Dynamo\u2019s winning time at Punchestown in January suggests the Irish form could be strongest and he gets the nod at around 5-2.\n2.10 Edwardstone has been impressively consistent but he has little in hand on Timeform\u2019s ratings and looks too short at 11-4. Haut En Couleurs (8-1) lacks his experience, which is a concern, but the market gave him a similar chance to stable companion Blue Lord before his fall at Leopardstown last time and his winning form on debut is rock-solid.\nThe 2022 Cheltenham Festival will open on mainly good going after a warm, drying day at the track yesterday resulted in the ground drying out rapidly to good, good-to-soft in places, having been good-to-soft, soft in places on Sunday. There will be no watering on the Old Course \u2013 which stages the first two days of the meeting \u2013 as up to 9mm of rain are forecast for the track on Wednesday.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s currently soft, good-to-soft in places on the New Course, which is in use for the last two days,\u201d Jon Pullin, Cheltenham\u2019s clerk of the course, said on Monday night. \u201cWe are dry today, with temperatures of around 13 or 14C, and it\u2019s a similar forecast for the opening day, but then on Wednesday there is some rain around, with the lower end of forecasts around 3mm, but some forecasts indicating up to 8 or 9mm.\u00a0\n\u201cIt will be spread throughout the day, but if it becomes heavier it will be during the afternoon,\" Pullin added. \"We irrigated the New Course on Friday with 12mm, based on the forecast we were given and the warm temperatures that were expected. We\u2019ll see where we are with forecasts for Wednesday and assess how much rain we actually get before making any decision on further watering of the New Course.\u201d\n2.50 Our Power ran into traffic problems at a vital stage at Kempton last time, but removed any doubts about his stamina for this three-mile trip when staying on well to finish within eight lengths of the winner. At 14-1, he is a very fair price to give Denman\u2019s Gold Cup-winning jockey, Sam Thomas, his first Festival winner as a trainer.\n4.10 Almost a private sweepstake for the Irish, who have the first six in the betting. Burning Victory, also very useful on the Flat, could be the one with most potential to find improvement, having looked more assured over hurdles in victory at Punchestown last month.\nSedgefield\n1.15 Nora The Xplorer\n1.50 Astra Via\n2.30 Coral Blue\n3.10 Just Call Me Al\n3.50 Sayar\n4.30 Powerful Position\n5.10 Royal SamCheltenham\n1.30 Dysart Dynamo\n2.10 Haut En Couleurs\n2.50 Our Power (nap)\n3.30 Honeysuckle\n4.10 Burning Victory\n4.50 Bell Ex One\n5.30 Stattler (nb)Southwell\n5.20 Enderman\n5.55 Divine Connection\n6.30 Art Expert\n7.00 Brandy Station\n7.30 Fair Star\n8.00 Daafy\n8.30 Capla SpiritNewcastle\n5.45 Love Mystery\n6.15 War Defender\n6.45 Old News\n7.15 Monsieur Jumbo\n7.45 Ginato\n8.15 Pulse Of Poppy\n4.50 A daunting puzzle where at least a dozen runners could improve a stone on their form to date and still find a few to beat them.

Plus letters from Mariam Khan and Stacy Marking\nGaby Hinsliff\u2019s conclusions on Westminster bullying are well-founded (Let the humiliation of John Bercow be a warning to bullying bosses everywhere, 10 March). Part of the explanation for this malignancy is that we tend to consider the few visible cases as exceptional rather than indicative. But while the reported behaviour of Dominic Cummings, Priti Patel or John Bercow may represent the higher-octane levels of outrageous conduct, it is hardly the case that lacerating tirades are rare in Westminster.\nIn my brief stint as a parliamentary researcher I witnessed displays of unconstrained thuggery by some MPs towards their subordinates that certainly would not have been tolerated in any other branch of public service. It would also have appalled the public, who are used to seeing only the urbane, polished versions of these MPs on television.\nIt was perfectly clear and wholly understood that, for some, party affiliations and personal ambition required these brutal tantrums to be endured as an occupational hazard.\nSuch tolerance has three pernicious effects: lowering of the bar for what is permissible; encouraging a perception that abuse is the consequence merely of passion and perfectionism; and imagining that an elevated position should offer indemnity against sanction for behaviour for which the less exalted would be dismissed.\nHinsliff is, of course, right to point to the heavy obligation that rests with the workplace \u201cthat makes the rules for everyone else\u201d, but institutional cultures have long histories and deep roots, and their dismantling always has as many defenders as disruptors. That is why they endure despite good sense, public incredulity or common decency.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex\n Workplace bullying \u2013 which can be sideways between workers, upwards from workers to supervisors, or downwards from supervisors to workers \u2013 is rampant in many organisations. In the absence of clear policies against this, ideas about what is workplace bullying remain arbitrary and subjective. Employers should implement clear policies on this and raise awareness at all levels.\nPeople who are hurt are prone to hurting others and creating a negative work environment. Organisations should consider pre-employment psychological screening to identify people with personality disorders, while ensuring that the screening is not used to discriminate against vulnerable people, but to protect others from the harmful effects of unaddressed psychological issues.Mariam KhanLahore, Pakistan\n Gaby Hinsliff does not mention Priti Patel\u2019s history of bullying and harassment in three separate ministries. Protected by Boris Johnson\u2019s instructions for MPs to \u201cform a square around the Prittster\u201d, Patel has somehow remained home secretary, while Bercow is ritually humiliated for seemingly the same (and, yes, inexcusable) offence.

If it really were the death knell for the staple of men\u2019s business attire then surely the Office for National Statistics would have replaced it with some tracksuit bottoms or even some shorts? Instead, what\u2019s taken its place is \u201ca formal jacket or blazer\u201d. It is an admission that these two very strange years of pandemic living have altered our daily sartorial habits but not transformed them completely.\nAs offices vacated and many of us adapted to working from home, a clear shift to \u201ctop-down dressing\u201d emerged (remember the \u201cZoom shirt\u201d?). But when the government dispensed with Covid restrictions, a return to the workplace forced us to dust off our commuting wear and re-evaluate our wardrobes in a fresh light. The transition from elasticated waistbands and Uggs to formal trousers and brogues has been a tricky one, however, and most of us are navigating our new style somewhere in between.\nA year ago, Marks & Spencer produced a range of \u201csemi suits\u201d featuring the kind of stretchy fabric one might associate with sports attire. At the time, the head of menswear design told me: \u201cCustomers are looking for hybrid pieces that are smart enough to wear into the office but still offer the comfort and relaxed style that they have been accustomed to.\u201d\nI think, one year on, this remains the case. Office workers still long for the comfort of their work-from-home wardrobe but equally desire options that give off an air of professionalism. It\u2019s a \u201ccasualisation\u201d of our wardrobe that\u2019s not casual at all. Indeed, the current definitions of \u201chybrid dressing\u201d and \u201ccasualisation\u201d have nothing to do with the \u201csmart casual\u201d of the past (with all its associations of provincial restrictiveness and slovenliness). Instead, it is about simply dialling down the strict boundaries between what\u2019s considered formal wear and what\u2019s not.\nMore so than No Time To Die or Peaky Blinders, Sunday night\u2019s Baftas were a good bellwether for the suit. Stars turned out in a mix of the traditional (Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston in classic cuts) and the new (Questlove in a robe and Crocs, Daniel Kaluuya wearing those turquoise furry armbands from Prada), which suggests the suit is now more \u201cconcept\u201d than time-honoured. It\u2019s a concept that forces its wearer to be inventive and express themselves.\nThe suit in all its forms isn\u2019t dead; it is, in fact, thriving. So let\u2019s take our \u201cformal jacket or blazer\u201d and get creative.",

After the decision, the case is expected to be formally sent to Priti Patel to approve the extradition.\nAssange\u2019s lawyers will have four weeks to make submissions to the home secretary before her decision. There also remain other routes to fight his extradition, for instance by mounting a challenge on other issues of law raised at first instance that he lost on and have not yet been subject to appeal.\nThe attempted appeal to the supreme court was specifically on the issue of the US assurances.\nIn January last year, district judge Vanessa Baraitser blocked extradition on the basis that procedures in prisons in the US would not prevent Assange from potentially taking his own life.\nBut that decision was overturned by two senior judges, Lord Burnett of Maldon, the lord chief justice, and Lord Justice Holroyde, at the high court. Burnett said the risk of Assange being held in highly restrictive US prison conditions was \u201cexcluded by the assurances which are offered. It follows that we are satisfied that, if the assurances had been before the judge, she would have answered the relevant question differently.\u201d\nResponding to the supreme court\u2019s decision, a spokesperson for Assange\u2019s solicitors, Birnberg Peirce, said: \u201cWe regret that the opportunity has not been taken to consider the troubling circumstances in which requesting states can provide caveated guarantees after the conclusion of a full evidential hearing. In Mr Assange\u2019s case, the court had found that there was a real risk of prohibited treatment in the event of his onward extradition.\u201d\nAssange is due to marry his fiancee, the lawyer Stella Moris, in Belmarsh prison on 23 March.",

It involved placing the detainee\u2019s heels against a specially designed plywood wall \u201cwhich had flexibility to it\u201d and putting a rolled up towel around the detainee\u2019s neck.\n\u201cThe interrogators would then grab the ends of the towel in front of and below the detainees face and shove [Baluchi] backwards into the wall, never letting go of the towel,\u201d the report said. One of the interrogators (identified only by a code) said the goal was to \u201cbounce\u201d the detainee off the wall. The report noted that Baluchi was \u201cnaked for the proceedings.\u201d\nThere was no time limit for the \u201cwalling\u201d sessions but \u201ctypically a session did not last for more than two hours at a time.\u201d They went on for so long because Baluchi was being used as a teaching prop.\nOne former trainee told investigators \u201call the interrogation students lined up to \u2018wall\u2019 Ammar so that [the instructor] could certify them on their ability to use the technique.\u201d\nThe report said that: \u201cIn the case of \u2018walling\u2019 in particular the [Office of the Inspector General] had difficulty determining whether the session was designed to elicit information from Ammar or to ensure that all interrogator trainees received their certification.\u201d\nThe fact that interrogators lined up to \u201cwall\u201d Ammar suggested that \u201ccertification was key,\u201d the report concluded.\nA neuropsychologist carried out an MRI of Baluchi\u2019s head in late 2018 and found \u201cabnormalities indicating moderate to severe brain damage\u201d in parts of his brain, affecting memory formation and retrieval as well as behavioral regulation. The specialist found that the \u201cabnormalities observed were consistent with traumatic brain injury.\u201d\nThe inspector general\u2019s report also concluded that Baluchi\u2019s treatment did not yield any useful intelligence. It noted that the interrogators at Cobalt \u201cfocused more on whether Ammar was \u2018compliant\u2019 than on the quality of the information he was providing.\u201d It called the CIA\u2019s logic in justifying the detention \u201cfuzzy and circular.\u201d\n\u201cAmmar fabricated the information he provided when undergoing EITs,\u201d it said. \u201cHe later admitted to his interrogators/debriefers that he was terrified and lied to get agency officers to stop the measures \u2026 Ammar also explained that he was afraid to tell a lie and was afraid to tell the truth because he did not know how either would be received.\u201d\nThe interrogators were convinced that Baluchi knew more than he was saying because he was a nephew of the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khaled Sheikh Mohammed. Baluchi spent more than three years in CIA custody, moved between a total of six \u201cblack sites\u201d before being transferred in 2006 to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where he is still awaiting trial.\nAlka Pradhan, one of his lawyers said: \u201cIf the CIA had not hidden their own conclusions about the illegality of Ammar\u2019s torture for this long, the US government would not have been able to bring charges against Ammar because we now know that the torture inflicted on Ammar led to lasting brain damage in the form of a traumatic brain injury and other debilitating illnesses that cannot be treated at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\u201d",

The government, which has been criticised for its slow response to the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, expects to provide \u201ctens of thousands\u201d more, according to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove.\nThree Britons who are thinking about offering to house Ukrainian refugees speak about why they are taking the step and what challenges they may encounter.\nJo Cooksey, a 56-year-old civil servant in Tameside, Greater Manchester, has been thinking about opening her home to refugees since people started fleeing Ukraine. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit by and watch this horror unfolding,\u201d Cooksey says. \u201cThe Polish have been amazing, the way they\u2019ve just opened the border and taken everybody who wants to go, but, obviously, Poland can\u2019t sustain that. I thought maybe there was a chance that we would be able to help. I would like to think that somebody would do the same for me, you know?\u201d\nThe 56-year-old, who has had a spare room since her daughter moved out, says she \u201cwould offer [her] home to a woman with a child or an elderly person\u201d for \u201cas long as it takes.\u201d The homes for Ukraine programme asks people to commit to providing housing for a minimum of six months. \u201cAt the moment, we just have no idea about what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big leap of faith to offer a home to a stranger. You\u2019re not going to know this person, and you won\u2019t know anything about their background until you meet them. However, that won\u2019t put me off trying to help.\u201d\nKyleen Kelly, 37, a part-time dental receptionist in Taunton, Somerset, has already donated money and items to local collections for Ukraine, but says she wants to keep helping refugees in whatever way she can. \u201cI\u2019ve got three children and I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through.

Maybe we can help with this crisis, at least, if we really weren\u2019t there for the Syrians.\u201d\nWhile Sullivan has some experience working with asylum seekers in the UK, she has never offered accommodation to people she doesn\u2019t know. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice I\u2019m glad I have and can make. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be that easy for either of us. But that\u2019s part of the challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it is scary for people to think about doing this and there are risks \u2026 but you\u2019ve got to accept all that and just hope you can bring good about despite it. It\u2019s not a reason not to try to do good.\u201d\nBen Fielding, 65, is already in touch with a Ukrainian family who are trying to reach the UK, and is ready to share his home in Kent with them. \u201cMy son, who\u2019s in the RAF, has reached out to a Ukrainian he knows to offer sanctuary to his wife and children while he remains in Ukraine to join the military,\u201d he says.\nThe family are still in Ukraine but are hoping to reach Poland in the next few days and, from there, travel to the UK. However, the portal for visa applications is not set to go live until Friday, and Fielding worries that the government is not acting quickly enough. \u201cWhat families like these need is certainty that they will be allowed to travel to the UK and to be able to stay with us,\u201d he says, adding that while he understands that such schemes take time to organise: \u201cThis family do not have this time.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me that the UK government is fiddling while Ukraine burns and innocent women and children suffer. Those fleeing the war need certainty now, so they can make plans while there is still time.\u201d",

        "content": "Criticism follows announcement that UK householders will have to name refugees they wish to sponsor\nMichael Gove\u2019s plan to permit UK householders to shelter Ukrainians seeking to escape the Russian war machine has been compared to a \u201cDIY asylum scheme\u201d after it was announced that people would have to name the refugees they wish to sponsor.\nThe communities secretary was criticised after setting out details of the homes for Ukraine scheme in the Commons on Monday, after complaints about the government\u2019s slow response to the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe for decades.\nThe scheme will initially only facilitate sponsorship between people with known connections so it can be \u201cup and running as soon as possible,\u201d Gove told MPs. He added that it should \u201crapidly\u201d expand by working with charities, faith and community groups.\nLisa Nandy, the shadow communities secretary, raised concerns over matching Ukrainian families to sponsors and claimed the government was suggesting people should advertise on Instagram via a \u201cDIY asylum scheme.\u201d\n\u201cOn his [Gove\u2019s] tour of the TV studios, he suggested several times that people who are willing to sponsor a Ukrainian family need to come to the government with the name of that family who will then rubber stamp it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t seriously be asking Ukrainian families who are fleeing Vladimir Putin, who have left their homes with nothing, to get on to Instagram and advertise themselves in the hope a British family might notice them. Is this genuinely the extent of this scheme?\u201d she said.\nThe details of the new scheme were unveiled after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, became the first senior MP to say that he would apply, while No 10 said the prime minister would not for security reasons. The website accepting UK applicants appeared to crash on Monday afternoon, minutes after being launched.\nBritons will be able to apply to accept Ukrainians into their homes for a minimum of six months, and will be given \u00a3350 a month for doing so. They will be subjected to \u201clight touch\u201d vetting checks and checks from local authorities on the suitability of their homes. By 8.30pm GMT on Monday, almost 37,000 forms had been submitted by UK householders to join the scheme.\nSponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years\u2019 leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Gove said the number of Ukrainians now arriving in the UK was \u201crapidly increasing.\u201d \u201cThe scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home. There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can benefit from this scheme,\u201d he said.\nAsked about safeguarding checks on UK applicants, he said: \u201cWe are working with the Home Office. We don\u2019t believe we need to have full DBS checks in order to make sure that someone is an appropriate sponsor.\n\u201cIt will often be the case that very light-touch criminal checks will be sufficient and then local authorities can be supported in order to make sure that people are safe.\u201d\nThe government has already made changes to simplify the visa application scheme, Gove said. \u201cWe are moving as quickly as possible in order to ensure \u2013 working with NGOs and local government \u2013 that individuals in need can be found the families and sponsors whom they need in order to get people into this country as quickly as possible.\u201d\nGove said he was speaking to people in local government 10 days ago about the scheme, telling MPs additional funding was available to local authorities for school places and care.\nNandy also questioned the government\u2019s insistence that Ukrainians will have to fill in lengthy visa application forms. \u201cWe could keep essential checks but drop the excessive bureaucracy,\u201d she said.\nThe SNP\u2019s home affairs spokesperson, Stuart McDonald, called for the government to \u201cstop asking Ukrainians to apply for visas altogether.\u201d\nEarlier, it emerged that the PM was unlikely to take any Ukrainian refugees into No 10 because of security concerns, but the transport secretary said he would apply to the new programme.\nAsked about Johnson, who lives in the flat above No 11 Downing Street with his wife, Carrie, and two of his children, the PM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThere are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10.\n\u201cVarious ministers have been asked about this. Obviously it will come down to individual circumstances. This is a significant commitment.\u201d\nShapps became the first senior MP to confirm he would register to host a Ukrainian refugee in his home.\n\u201cWe intend to apply today to join other UK households in offering our home to provide refuge to Ukrainians until it is safe for them to return to their country,\u201d he tweeted.\nAround 4,000 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show.\nThe Home Office has defended requiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia\u2019s invasion, arguing that it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need.\nThe government has faced criticism \u2013 including from its own MPs \u2013 over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nMore than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine as Russia continues its advance.The UN high commissioner for refugees has called it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war and it is expected that the number could grow to 4 million people.",

Given the large footprint of the site, whatever choice is made the club\u2019s wider vision may be to position the stadium as the centre of a cultural and community hub, similar to Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s stadium, which opened three years ago and cost around \u00a31bn.\nUnited executives are in the process of fielding different ideas from companies who would tender to carry out any work on a venue that was first built in 1910. But until a master planner is appointed no concrete decision will be made, with the club having committed to consulting with supporters throughout the process.\nNo notable modernisation of Old Trafford has occurred since Malcolm Glazer bought the club in 2005 \u2013 the increased capacity to 75,000 via the quadrants built in 2006 was approved before the now-deceased American became proprietor. Last month Collette Roche, United\u2019s chief operating officer, discussed the future of Old Trafford with the club fans\u2019 forum. \u201cWe have been assessing the capabilities of globally leading consultants who want to help us develop a masterplan for the modernisation of Old Trafford, with the ultimate aim of improving the matchday experience for fans,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe are hoping to appoint our preferred partners in the coming weeks; following this, we will be able to formally kick off phase one of the project, which will be focused on establishing the vision and objectives for the masterplan.\u201d\nUnited invested almost \u00a320m in Old Trafford in 2019 \u2013 \u00a311m was spent on improvements to accessible facilities, \u00a34m on security and \u00a34m on refurbishing hospitality locales.",

No to war\u2019\nAn employee on Russia\u2019s state Channel One television has interrupted the channel\u2019s main news programme with an extraordinary protest against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nMarina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the live broadcast of the nightly news on Monday evening, shouting: \u201cStop the war. No to war.\u201d\nShe also held a sign saying: \u201cDon\u2019t believe the propaganda. They\u2019re lying to you here.\u201d It was signed in English: \u201cRussians against the war.\u201d\nThe news anchor continued to read from her teleprompter speaking louder in an attempt to drown out Ovsyannikova, but her protest could be seen and heard for several seconds before the channel switched to a recorded segment.\nOvsyannikova also released a pre-recorded video via the OVD-Info human rights group in which she expressed her shame at working for Channel One and spreading \u201cKremlin propaganda.\u201d\n\u201cRegrettably, for a number of years, I worked on Channel One and worked on Kremlin propaganda, I am very ashamed of this right now. Ashamed that I was allowed to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed the zombification of the Russian people. We were silent in 2014 when this was just beginning. We did not go out to protest when the Kremlin poisoned [opposition leader Alexei] Navalny,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe are just silently watching this anti-human regime. And now the whole world has turned away from us and the next 10 generations won\u2019t be able to clean themselves from the shame of this fratricidal war.\u201d\nWearing a necklace in the colours of the Ukrainian and Russian flags, Ovsyannikova said in her video statement that her father is Ukrainian and her mother is Russian.\n\u201cWhat is happening in Ukraine is a crime and Russia is the aggressor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe responsibility of this aggression lies on the shoulders of only one person: Vladimir Putin.\u201d\nShe urged fellow Russians to join anti-war protests in order to bring an end to the conflict. \u201cOnly we have the power to stop all this madness. Go to the protests. Don\u2019t be afraid of anything. They can\u2019t imprison us all.\u201d\nThe protest was welcomed by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a video address on Monday night he said: \u201cI\u2019m thankful to those Russians who don\u2019t stop trying to deliver the truth, who are fighting against disinformation and tell real facts to their friends and families, and personally to that woman who went in the studio of Channel One with an anti-war poster.\u201d\nOVD-Info said that Ovsyannikova was arrested shortly after her protest and was being held at the Ostankino television centre. Pavel Chikov, head of of the Agora human rights group, later said Ovsyannikova had been arrested and taken to a Moscow police station.\nShe could face prison time under a newly introduced Russian legislation that criminalised spreading so-called \u201cfake news\u201d about the Russian military. Those found guilty under the law could face up to 15 years in jail.\nOvsyannikova could also face legal consequences for encouraging \u201ccivil unrest\u201d by telling Russians to protest.\nIn a statement published by the state news agency TASS, Channel One said that \u201can incident took place with an extraneous woman in shot. An internal check is being carried out.\u201d\nA law enforcement source told TASS that Ovsyannikova could be charged under legislation banning public acts that aim to \u201cdiscredit the use of Russia\u2019s armed forces.\u201d\nHer statement marks the first time that an employee from Russian state media has publicly denounced the war as the country continues its crackdown on anti-war dissent. So strict is the current wave 0f censorship that other news programmes blurred out the message on Ovsyannikova\u2019s sign in their own reports on the incident.\nSince the start of the war, Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on protestors, independent news outlets and foreign social media networks. Nearly 15,000 people, including children and elderly people have been detained for protesting against the war.\nMore than two dozen Russian media outlets have been blocked by the country\u2019s media regulator or have chosen to cease operations. The widely used social media platforms Facebook and Instagram have also been banned.\nState TV meanwhile, remains the main source of news for many millions of Russians, and closely follows the Kremlin line.\nWithin hours of her protest, more than 40,000 people had so far left comments on Ovsyannikova\u2019s Facebook page, with many praising her for her taking a stand.\n\u201cYou are a hero. Thank you so much,\u201d one comment read.\nVideos of the incident quickly racked up thousands of views.\n\u201cWow, that girl is cool,\u201d tweeted Kira Yarmysh, the spokesperson for the jailed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny.\nEdgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, Latvia\u2019s foreign minister, said on Twitter: \u201cWhile there are brave people like Maria #Ovsyanikova, a producer at Russia\u2019s Channel 1, protesting against the Russia\u2019s war and propaganda tonight or protesters on the streets #Russia still has a chance for better future.\u201d\n This article was amended on 16 March 2022. Ovsyannikova\u2019s necklace was in the colours of the Russian as well as the Ukrainian flag, not just the latter as stated in an earlier version.",

He said afterwards: \u201cI could hear his [Dubler\u2019s] voice bouncing in my cranium like a bat out of hell.\u201d\nIt was acknowledged on Tuesday with the AOC\u2019s inaugural Cecil Healy Award for Outstanding Sportsmanship displayed at an Olympic Games.\n\u201cIn the closing stages, Cedric had no other thought, other than the possibility for his teammate winning an Olympic medal,\u201d AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said. \u201cHe could have easily chosen to improve his own standing in the event, but he made another choice and it was a noble one.\u201d\nThe award was created in August 2018 in memory of Cecil Healy, whose act of sportsmanship at the 1912 Games in Stockholm was widely commended.\nThe Australian swimmer insisted 100m favourite Duke Kahanamoku be allowed to contest the final, despite the American missing his semi-final due to an apparent mix-up. Healy\u2019s stance led to officials holding a special semi-final to include Kahanamoku, who duly went on to win gold in the final. Healy won silver.\n\u201cI am absolutely honoured and really quite amazed that something that happened in the moment can result in this type of recognition,\u201d Dubler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t compete at the Olympic Games thinking about these moments. Every athlete just wants to do their best and performance is the focus.\n\u201cThe camaraderie amongst decathletes is something very special, but I also felt a really strong bond within our Australian team in Tokyo.\n\u201cI am still stunned that my spontaneous decision to urge him on struck such a chord around the world. I definitely can\u2019t compare my actions with those of Cecil Healy, but I am immensely proud to be the first Australian to win this award, named in his honour.\u201d\nDubler will be formally honoured with the presentation of a special medal at the AOC\u2019s AGM next month.",

The Ever Given\u2019s plight caused headaches for more than 400 waiting vessels, costing global trade $6bn to $10bn a day, according to a study. The Ever Forward\u2019s grounding, on the other hand, was \u201cnot preventing other ships from transiting to the Port of Baltimore\u201d, said William P Doyle, the executive director of the Maryland Port Association, to Bloomberg in a statement on Monday. \u201cEfforts have been under way since last night to try and free the ship and will continue today.\u201d\nOther ships in the area were told to slow down and use a one-way traffic pattern.\nThe ship needs water at least 43ft deep to move, but it was stuck in an area that was just 25ft deep. It was not clear when it might be freed. \u201cEverything like this is kind of its own beast,\u201d the coastguard petty officer Steven Lehmann told the Baltimore Sun.\nThe effort to rescue the Ever Given, which weighs 220,000 metric tons, required dredging 30,000 cubic meters of sand, with the help of 13 tugboats and a rising tide. The vessel was trapped from 23 to 29 March.\nSince then, however, the Ever Given has managed to get through the canal without getting stuck. The maritime app Marine Traffic showed it in the Red Sea on Monday night, headed toward the Suez once again.",

        "content": "We need dedicated government support \u2013 including a wholesale reassessment of how to respond to future disasters\nWatching the flood waters rise in the Northern Rivers, Queensland and far western Sydney last week, I\u2019ve had a horrible sense of deja vu.\nDread. Exhaustion. Abandonment. And a rising, furious anger.\nI\u2019ve been a New South Wales Rural Fire Service volunteer for several years. My unit is based in the Blue Mountains. In late 2019, I was involved in what is now called the Black Summer.\nThese floods are horribly reminiscent of that time. Not just because of the scale of the disaster, but because people in some of the worst circumstances imaginable have, again, been abandoned by the government.\nOver Black Summer, the prime minister went overseas for a holiday. He should have been in Australia, if only to demonstrate support for the communities that were really suffering. It was an insensitive thing to do \u2013 especially when people like myself were giving up time with our kids to protect our communities.\nI can only talk for myself, but I was baffled that there was so little support for RFS volunteers and our communities from the federal government. Seeing the scenes from Lismore and Brisbane and Richmond over the last week, I get the same feeling.\nThe months of Black Summer were the hardest of my life. Not just because of the fires, or the fear and devastation I saw in the towns, or the nights, days and weekends away from my kids. As the months dragged on, and me and my mates exhausted ourselves trying to defend or save what we could, I was thinking: where\u2019s the government? When are they coming to help? Why are we on our own?\nFirefighting and preparation is some of the most backbreaking work you can do. Imagine hacking defensive lines through the scrub, backburning in dense bush, dragging heavy equipment through difficult, dangerous terrain to put out fires and doing most of that in heavy PPE and thick smoke.\nNone of that was surprising \u2013 it comes with the job. But the length and intensity of that fire season was something else.\nFor weeks on end, I spent every moment I physically could on the fireground. When I couldn\u2019t do that, I helped people in the community prepare or went to my full-time job. I spent New Year\u2019s Eve patrolling a defensive burn. I\u2019d get stopped on the street by people who wanted to know what was happening. There was no downtime.\nLife became a blur. I barely saw my kids although it was school holidays. I ran out of paid leave, so I took unpaid leave. That was a financial hit. There\u2019s little else you can do when your community is at risk and when your mates are as tired as you are. There\u2019s no one else to do it.\nThis is no criticism of the RFS. The RFS was amazing. I always felt supported and still do. They did an unbelievable job with the resources they had. The communities, too, were unbelievable \u2013 you have no idea how much that meant. People brought us home cooked meals. Kids drew pictures. Everyone knew that season was above and beyond.\nBut volunteers need time to heal. Seeing burnt-out houses and hearing stories of people dying to defend their homes, seeing that level of fire intensity and living on high alert for months scars you. It feels like a lifetime and several world-changing events away, but Black Summer was only two years ago.\nThat\u2019s another reason I think these floods are so frightening. They\u2019re evidence that climate change is already here, and we are nowhere near prepared for it. Anyone on the ground will tell you that the summers are getting hotter, and the fires are getting worse. We\u2019ve had at least four major catastrophic fires in recent history.\nClimate change means the old volunteer model we\u2019ve used for decades to respond to natural disasters isn\u2019t as effective. It was never designed to tie people up for weeks or months at a time. Many volunteers are older too; there\u2019s only so long they can do the physical work the RFS requires.\nListening to politicians talk about people being \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cresilient\u201d makes me so angry now. We are tough, but we\u2019re human too. We have families and responsibilities that we can\u2019t just set aside. When a disaster like Black Summer or these floods happens, community spirit only gets you so far.\nWe need dedicated government support \u2013 not just more funding and bodies on the ground, but a wholesale reassessment of what disasters from now on are going to look like, and what we\u2019ll need to help people through them.\nWe also need a government that finally bites the bullet and admits that corporations burning coal and gas are heating the planet, which is killing people and destroying entire communities.\nAustralia is the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world \u2013 behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. Pretending that our massive coal and gas exports aren\u2019t fuelling these disasters is unbelievably cynical.\nI want a government that helps me to help my community when we need it. People want to help their neighbours. It\u2019s a natural instinct. But to just expect regular people to do all the work without backing them to do it is crazy. It feels like, on a fundamental level, the government just doesn\u2019t get that.\nI hope I\u2019m wrong. I hope that the floods wake us up in a way the fires didn\u2019t. When the election comes around, I hope people remember who turned up to help, and who didn\u2019t.\n The writer is a RFS volunteer in western Sydney and a GetUp member.

The union has run a series of rolling industrial actions in a bid to force the government to make concessions on its pay and safety demands.\nLast month\u2019s shutdown prompted a significant scandal within the government after Elliott incorrectly blamed the union for a \u201cstrike\u201d and accused them of \u201cterrorist-like activity\u201d.\nIt later emerged it was the government that had ordered the shutdown due to safety concerns, and that Elliott had gone to bed while bureaucrats scrambled to make a call on the network after negotiations fell apart at the 11th hour.\nThe union has been engaged in ongoing industrial action for months, and is due to begin a separate round of action on Monday 20 March. On Tuesday, Elliott was unable to say whether that action would lead to another round of shutdowns, but conceded it was likely to lead to significant disruptions.\n\u201cUnfortunately \u2026 we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is a strong possibility this industrial action, over a prolonged period of time, could cause the rail management to restrict services. The advice I\u2019ve got is there is every possibility we won\u2019t be able to run the network.\u201d\nThe dispute between the union and the government has escalated significantly since Elliott became transport minister in December, but the minister dismissed questions about his responsibility for the ongoing disruptions.\n\u201cA lot has been said about communication between my office other people over the course of the last few weeks. I can give you an ironclad guarantee that conversations have been had, emails have been exchanged, text messages have been exchanged,\u201d he said.\nElliott also said he had potentially acted illegally by attempting to negotiate with the union prior to being sworn in as minister.\n\u201cI met with this union before I was even sworn in, probably illegally, I was negotiating before I was even sworn in as the transport minister,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI gave them their first concession before I was even sworn in as transport minister.\u201d\nBut the minister could not say whether he had met with the union since last month\u2019s shutdown, and revealed he would not be in Sydney for the next negotiation meeting with the union on Thursday because he was meeting with homeless veterans in flood-affected Lismore.\nAfter the shutdown, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Elliott was set to announce half-price peak-hour travel and free fares on weekends to apologise for the chaotic shutdown that left thousands of commuters stranded.\nOn Tuesday he defended not having made that announcement three weeks later, saying he was \u201cactively considering\u201d options for discounts.\n\u201cAs recently as this morning I\u2019ve discussed with the member for Sydney about what way we would ensure we get maximum economic activity in the CBD in relation to fare,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nBut Claassens earlier called on the government to come through on the commitment.\n\u201cWorkers are still waiting on offers from the government to resolve basic safety claims that were made nine months ago. It\u2019s beyond ridiculous that we\u2019re still taking industrial action to force the government to do its job.\u201d",

So I forgive myself for not initially noticing the two limestone slabs standing upright in a dismantled wall.\nThis drystone structure is being rebuilt and these two columns, 1.2 metres high, perhaps 35cm apart, have been left to serve presumably as the stile through which walkers will pass. The stones were probably first cut when there was no such thing as engine noise here and the loudest human sounds were the clank of hammer on metal as a thick L-shaped iron bar was driven into the heart of one rock as a gate hinge.\nNext to this detail is snagged a long, whitish, wind-wittering strand of wool, and it occurs to me that this one hair has a heritage stretching back probably to the Zagros mountains of Iran, where sheep began their 11,000-year journey of domestication to this very spot.\nOn the other stone, however, is the evidence of a deeper past. The surface limestone ripples with fossils of crinoids or sea lilies, echinoderm animals anchored by a central rope-like stem into the seabed and possessed of swaying seaweedy limbs that sifted out planktonic food from the currents when this place was an ocean more than 300m years ago.\nThe beautiful crinoid remnants take me to another time, but there is one detail here that carries me into another galaxy. Around the old gate hinge is a tarnished grey metal mass, used to secure the blacksmith\u2019s ironwork and probably extracted from these very hillsides, given that lead mining here dates back to the Romans.\nYet lead originates through stellar nucleosynthesis in the hearts of stars called supernovae, whose explosions have scattered the rare element across space, until it finally came to rest at the birth of our solar system about five billion years ago. Lead was veined through the underworld of this landscape and then fixed as solder around this hinge. So, walker, when you pass this spot next, recall that you are seeing the one place, but you are brushing past a whole universe.\n Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

        "content": "Environmental law organisation ClientEarth brings action and urges other shareholders to join\nThe directors of Shell are being sued for failing to properly prepare the multinational oil and gas company for net zero.\nIn what is thought to be a first-of-its-kind action, the lawsuit brought by activist shareholders claims that Shell\u2019s 13 directors are personally liable for failing to devise a strategy in line with the Paris agreement, which aims to limit global heating to below 2C by slashing fossil fuel emissions.\nThe lawsuit claims the failure puts the directors in breach of their duties under the UK\u2019s Companies Act.\nIf successful, Shell\u2019s board could be forced by the courts to change its strategy, taking specific concrete steps to align its plan with the Paris deal. But if the claimants lose, they could be liable for the full costs of the case, including directors\u2019 legal fees.\nClientEarth, the environmental law organisation taking the action against Shell, said it was calling for other shareholders to join.\nAt Shell\u2019s 2021 annual general meeting more than 30% of shareholders voted against the board in support of a resolution calling for Paris-aligned emissions targets.\nBut other shareholders may be reluctant to join after Shell announced in February an increase in dividends and a plan to buy back shares \u2013 increasing the value of those remaining in investors\u2019 hands \u2013 after reporting a staggering $19bn profit.\nClientEarth has said it is taking the action against Shell in the company\u2019s best interests. Their claim says the board has failed to properly account for the risks climate change poses to the company. Under the Companies Act, directors are legally bound to act in a way that promotes the company\u2019s success and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence.\nPaul Benson, a ClientEarth lawyer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first of its kind, this case. It\u2019s the first time that anyone has sought to hold the board accountable for failing to properly prepare for the net zero transition.\u201d\n\u201cIt is highly novel, we\u2019re in uncharted territory here but we see real merit with this claim. We think, frankly, the longer the board delays with this the more likely it is that the company is going to have to execute this sort of handbrake turn to retain commercial competitiveness, to meet the challenges of inevitable regulatory developments.\u201d\nIt will not be the first time Shell has faced action over emissions. In May 2021, a Dutch court ruled the company must reduce its emissions \u2013 including those from the fuel it sells \u2013 by 45% by the end of 2030.\nBut Shell\u2019s directors have appealed against that verdict and published an \u201cenergy transition strategy\u201d outlining the company\u2019s aim to reach net zero by 2050 \u2013 a transition it describes as \u201cin step with society\u201d. ClientEarth\u2019s lawyers say the strategy does not meet the targets scientists say are critical to avoid catastrophic climate change.\n\u201cWe say in our claim that Shell\u2019s board is mismanaging the material and foreseeable climate risk facing the company,\u201d Benson said.\n\u201cShell is actually really quite exposed to the risks of climate change those are physical risks and transitional risks. They are exposed to what we call stranded asset risk, where their assets \u2013 for example their facilities, their physical infrastructure \u2013 the value of that is just going to reduce or it will become a liability as the net zero transition progresses.\n\u201cAnd they are exposed to massive write-downs of those assets.\u201d\nA Shell spokesperson said: \u201cTo be a net-zero emissions business by 2050, we are delivering on our global strategy that supports the Paris agreement. This includes the industry-leading target we have set to halve emissions from our global operations by 2030, and transforming our business to provide more low-carbon energy for customers.\n\u201cAddressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters. The energy supply challenges we are seeing underscore the need for effective, government-led, policies to address critical needs such as energy security while decarbonising our energy system. These challenges cannot be solved by litigation.\u201d",

The most recent official figures showed that the NHS in England is short of almost 8,200 doctors.\nDr Dustyn Saint, a GP in Norfolk, tweeted the health secretary, Sajid Javid, about the situation, saying: \u201cSajid Javid sort this out! You know how much general practice needs these people in a few years, standing by and doing nothing is inexcusable.\u201d\nAnother doctor said: \u201cIt\u2019s bonkers that 800 would-be doctors could be denied training places at a time when the NHS in England is short of 8,200 doctors.\u201d\nHalf (393) the 791 will soon graduate from UK medical schools while the other half (398) are \u201celigibility applicants\u201d \u2013 those with a medical degree from an overseas medical school who are entitled to work in the UK or who graduated from a British medical school before August 2020.\nThe UK Foundation Programme (UKFPO) ensures that aspirant doctors who have just graduated from medical school are able to start foundation one training, the bottom rung of the ladder that leads to medics becoming fully qualified. Training usually starts in the August after graduation.\nBut the UKFPO has warned that the foundation programme is \u201cover-subscribed\u201d to a record level this year, raising the prospect that some of the 791 may not be allocated a training slot.\nWhile it has already filled 8,209 foundation training places, the 791 who have missed out so far have been put on a reserve list.\nThe UKFPO, which is run by Health Education England (HEE), has told them that: \u201cWe would like to reassure the applicants on our reserve list, who may be feeling anxious, that we are currently working very hard to find additional places for everyone who needs one.\u201d\nIt works with the health departments in the four home nations to ensure that the NHS has as many new trainee doctors as they need and works with them to increase numbers if necessary.\nThe 791 is the largest number of applicants on record that the UKFPO has not placed by this stage of the year. In 2017 only 25 graduates were in that position, though that number has risen sharply in recent years and by last year had risen to 494.\nHEE has blamed the situation on a record number of applicants and promised \u201cpastoral support\u201d to medical graduates on the reserve list, many of whom are anxious about their futures.\n\u201cThere have been record numbers of applicants for the 2022 foundation programme. Although the statutory medical education bodies have increased the number of foundation posts available, we recognise that 791 students have been placed on the reserve list,\u201d said Prof Liz Hughes, HEE\u2019s deputy medical director.\nIt has sought to reassure graduates without a training place that they will get one somewhere in the UK by August. Places will be freed because historically about 7% of applicants withdraw between applying and starting their F1 training, it said.\nThe British Medical Association has voiced concern about the large number of unallocated medics. \u201cNow we have a situation where a record number are left with unnecessary uncertainty about where they are headed this August,\u201d said Khadija Meghrawi, the co-chair of its medical students committee. \u201cIn a time where student mental health is declining, this additional source of uncertainty and stress is particularly unfair.\u201d\nProf Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cIt is important we get to the bottom of why this has happened and address it as soon as possible. It\u2019s encouraging that we have so many people completing medical school and wanting to continue their training. This needs to be matched by capacity in foundation training schemes.\u201d\nAzeem Majeed, a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s essential that workforce planning in the NHS is adequate, given that there are shortages of many health professionals, including doctors. This means having enough foundation posts for newly qualified doctors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that most of the 791 people without foundation doctor posts will eventually be allocated one but it does create undue stress for them and they may be allocated a role in a part of England where it may be difficult for them to work due to family reasons.\u201d",

        "content": "Pandemic upended finances, and action over possible job cuts, pay freezes and closures seems likely\nA \u201cspring of discontent\u201d is looming for the railways as unions and senior rail officials prepare for widespread industrial action in response to curbs in government emergency funding that spell job cuts, pay freezes and closures.\nTalks between the industry and unions to negotiate the \u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn savings demanded by the Treasury were held through last year on the basis of no compulsory redundancies and no walkouts. That agreement lapsed at the end of 2021 \u2013 leaving unions warning of immediate strike action should any jobs be axed.\nThat outcome now appears inevitable, with formal proposals for cuts, including substantial job losses in maintenance roles to save \u00a3100m annually at Network Rail, expected in the coming weeks. Train operators will try to cut staff costs in a move to contactless ticketing. Mick Lynch, the leader of rail\u2019s biggest union, the RMT, says: \u201cIt\u2019s our belief that they want to close virtually every ticket office on the mainline railway.\u201d\nThe roots of the dispute lie with the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended the finances of rail firms \u2013 potentially even more than those of the London Underground, where two 24-hour strikes earlier this month closed the tube. Passenger numbers have fluctuated similarly on both networks, from deserted at the start of the pandemic to between 60 and 70% of pre-Covid levels now.\nYet the past two years have brought other changes that mean some are questioning how much power a stoppage still holds to disrupt on national rail and London transport.\nTim Shoveller, a Network Rail regional director, said: \u201cEven as passenger numbers start to recover, we know travel habits and passenger demand have changed and the industry has to change, too. We cannot keep relying on government handouts. We are discussing ideas with our unions about how we can modernise to create better and safer jobs for our people.\u201d\nUnions argue that their members, who kept transport services running during the pandemic, should not pick up the tab, either on national rail or in the capital. More RMT walkouts are likely in London, where pensions as well as job cuts are in the frame, after the mayor, Sadiq Khan, was told to find \u00a3500m in annual cost savings in order to receive almost \u00a35bn in emergency state funding to cover shrinking tube fare income.\nBut do rail strikes still work for unions? Bringing London to a standstill for most of the working week would have been intolerable to many businesses before Covid; with Tube trains normally now only two-thirds full, the impact this month was muted. Many commuters could dodge the disruption by staying at home to work, leaving the city\u2019s remaining trains, buses and roads crowded but far more functional than in strike days gone by.\nA similar picture could emerge on national rail this spring: some key commuter railways, such as South Western, which once heaved with annual season ticket holders riding daily to the City, have been left with their lucrative regular clientele melting away. A senior industry source says of the strike option: \u201cThey used to have an ace of spades. Now it\u2019s a five of hearts.\u201d\nOthers disagree. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, contends that the threat of a strike could be \u201cmore powerful in the confusing new world created by Grant Shapps\u201d. Under the transport secretary\u2019s reforms to franchising, more of the railway is under central control through new contracts where all fare income goes to government rather than being at the operators\u2019 risk.\nThe London School of Economics professor Tony Travers, a local government expert, argues that despite the falling numbers of affected commuters who may be stranded by a rail strike, \u201cthe government, in a curious way by guaranteeing the income, has re-empowered the unions. They can use their muscle in the normal way because the government and Khan still want to keep the tube and the national railway running.\u201d\nWhile smaller than the RMT, the drivers\u2019 union has a greater ability to stop trains: in the Southern dispute of 2016-17, rail managers attempted to step in to replace striking RMT conductors but nothing ran on the few days that Aslef went on strike.\nAt the moment, it is relatively relaxed about its members\u2019 prospects: train companies remain short of drivers and rely on overtime \u2013 and about 2,000 drivers, who are typically middle-aged men, are due to retire in the next five years. However, Whelan says: \u201cThere are issues that would, rightly, lead to national action. Let\u2019s remember that many of our members, who put themselves at risk for two years during the pandemic, have received no pay rises. That cannot continue.\u201d\nThe final year of an inflation-linked pay deal has kept tube salaries up in London but on national rail, Lynch says a two-year freeze is \u201ceffectively a 10% cut so far and the clock is ticking\u201d. A total of 1,450 managers have also left Network Rail, so far by voluntary redundancy, saving \u00a3100m. The TSSA union said any compulsory cuts would prompt immediate industrial action.\nThe Rail Delivery Group estimates that \u00a314bn in fare revenue has been lost to the industry since the pandemic started, with another \u00a36bn shortfall over the next three years. A spokesperson said it had been \u201can unprecedented financial shock\u201d, adding: \u201cThe whole industry needs to respond to the challenges we face with the acceleration of changing travel patterns and more passengers migrating to digital technology.\u201d\nTicket offices are under threat of closure \u2013 a politically difficult prospect, not only because of union opposition. \u201cPeople see there\u2019s no argument when you do the sums,\u201d said a senior figure at a rail operating group. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want their own one closed.\u201d\nFor the RMT at least, there is no sign of strikes abating. The union has been coordinating action ranging from the night tube dispute, which has stopped Transport for London relaunching 24-hour weekend services, to walkouts by conductors on TransPennine Express, and outsourced train cleaners at Churchill in the south-east.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like going on strike. Our members lose money, we take a lot of heat and it\u2019s not a great position,\u201d Lynch says. However, he adds: \u201cThe reason people see us is because our union will not be cowed. The unions that have given way have lost membership and lost the ability to fight for people.\u201d\nFor Lynch, the point of this month\u2019s walkouts was clear: \u201cWhere unions don\u2019t fight, people end up on the minimum wage, no pension, no rights. I think it will make a difference because it shows people that we\u2019re serious.\u201d",

When the principals refused to relent, a group of students took the matter to court.\nFearing unrest over the ruling, the state government, run by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which also governs nationally, has banned large gatherings this week.\nThe college authorities were backed by the state government which contended in court that the hijab was not an essential religious practice of Islam, and banning it in classrooms did not violate the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom.\nThe students argued the opposite, namely, that the constitution guaranteed them the right to practise their faith and Islam required them to wear the hijab.\nAcross the state, the controversy triggered protests and violence. In retaliation, rightwing Hindu groups demanded the right to wear saffron scarves in the classroom if the hijab was allowed \u2013 saffron is the colour of Hinduism and is associated with the BJP.\nStudent activist Dhruv Jatti welcomed the verdict, saying that no Muslim student had insisted earlier on wearing the hijab and accused Islamist activists of having a hand in the case. \u201cBut I do feel that to avoid poisoning the atmosphere in college, Muslim girls should get counselling so they can understand the reasons for the ruling and come to college,\u201d Jatti told NDTV news channel.\nMukhtar Abbas Naqvi, federal BJP minister for minorities, welcomed the ruling.\n\u201cMuslim women can wear the hijab wherever they want \u2013 the market, the shop, the street, in private colleges \u2013 but government educational institutions have their own dress code and this must be followed,\u201d he said.\nThere has been no response yet from the Muslim students who took the matter to court. They are expected to appeal against it in the supreme court.\nThe ruling is unlikely to douse the fiery debate that has been raging in India for weeks. Some fear that a ban on the hijab will force Muslim girls to stay at home and not seek an education.\nIn a multi-religious society like India where people of each faith \u2013 such as Sikhs and their turbans and Hindus with their dab of vermilion on their foreheads wear symbols \u2013 they argue it is untenable to ban the hijab, particularly as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is a monk who wears saffron robes.\nThe fear among this group is that the BJP is trying again to impose its Hindu majority agenda on the minorities by depriving them of their right to religion and their freedom of choice.",

        "content": "The surge in campervan holidays in Scotland has had a negative impact on local communities. Now, a Hebridean island has found a sustainable solution\nWith an ever-growing number of Britons choosing to holiday in the UK, campervans and motorhomes have become much more popular, providing, as they do, a balance between freedom and home comforts. But in Scotland, in particular, the sheer number of large vehicles visiting popular rural areas has become a seasonal problem for some communities. Last summer, issues with inappropriate parking and waste management reached crisis point, causing local frustration and negative newspaper stories.\nCalmac, which runs ferries to the Hebrides, reports that annual motorhome crossings have risen from 16,507 in 2015 to 56,420 in 2021. The story is similar in the Highlands \u2013 Gordon Petrie from Scottish Campervan Rentals in Crieff, tells of an overwhelming increase in inquiries.\nMany visitors do not understand that Scotland\u2019s wild camping rules don\u2019t apply to motor vehicles, which causes additional problems. So, as campervan numbers climb, many Scottish communities are looking for ways to make their tourist season more sustainable. One successful model is on the Hebridean island of Tiree.\nTiree was suffering from uncontrolled campervan arrivals long before this latest surge in popularity, and the community took uncompromising action in 2010. Visiting camping vehicles must now book an overnight pitch in advance, which will be checked by a ranger on arrival. To facilitate this, Tiree\u2019s Croft Camping scheme allows individual crofters to allocate an unserviced piece of land and host a maximum of three vehicles. There are nine sites on the island, with pitches costing \u00a312 a night and water and waste facilities in the island\u2019s main village of Scarinish. There is also a traditional campsite at Balinoe.\nTiree ranger Hayley Douglas says: \u201cThe scheme was introduced to ease pressure on Tiree\u2019s fragile environment, and reduce conflict over inappropriate access. Our machair and sand dune habitat is unique, hosting protected rare species. Additionally, some crofting land is unfenced. Previously, visitors were driving on to folk\u2019s crofts and damaging their grazing, as well as our protected areas.\u201d\nWhile there was some initial pushback from visitors, the scheme has now been operating for over a decade, and Douglas says it\u2019s been a success. Crofters can make additional income, and campers are generally keen to visit responsibly, and pitch on picturesque sites. \u201cLast year, we had none of the publicised campervan problems here, despite nearly triple the usual campers. Since then, many other communities have contacted me to see how they can set up something similar,\u201d Douglas adds.\nCrofter Rhoda Meek says the scheme is vital to balance the number of campervans with the capacity of the island\u2019s roads and infrastructure \u2013 and the added benefit for crofters. She says: \u201cIt hopefully helps visitors understand they are not just parked in beauty spots, but that the land is someone\u2019s home and livelihood.\u201d\nAcross the constituency, Brendan O\u2019Hara, Argyll and Bute\u2019s SNP MP, describes campervans as a welcome frustration. \u201cWe rely on tourism economically, and understand why folk want to come here: it\u2019s a beautiful part of the world. We\u2019re set up for tourism and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the more the merrier.\u201d\nHowever, he says, the frustration comes from the failure of some campervan drivers to realise they are visiting local communities, where \u201cfolk have to get on with their daily lives\u201d.\nFunding is needed to establish infrastructure, and it\u2019s unlikely any one-size-fits-all approach would suit the whole Highlands and Islands region.\nMull, a larger, more populous island, has recently taken similar steps to stop campervans arriving without bookings. The island has asked Calmac to display a warning message during online ferry bookings. While a small minority of visitors go against this request \u2013 pitch bookings are not checked on arrival as in Tiree \u2013 the situation has greatly improved.\nAnthony Robin, manager of community-owned Camping Skye, says the road and parking infrastructures on Skye are not yet good enough to cope with increasing visitor traffic.\nWhile the Highland Council and community try to address this, the campsite provides visitor information. \u201cWe point people in the right direction, making it easier for visitors to enjoy themselves, while protecting small communities from waves of tourists on wheels,\u201d says Robin. The campsite\u2019s profits are used for community projects, including new public toilets in Broadford and Elgol.\nHighlander John MacPherson says opinions on campervans are polarised. His family have been working in tourism since the 19th century, when his grandfather owned a stables in Fort William. They ran carriages for visitors, including Queen Victoria, and offered pony trips up Ben Nevis. Managing Highland tourism is nothing new to them.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked around the Highlands and Islands for 40 years, sleeping in my van, and have seen dramatic changes recently: previously accessible pull-outs blocked off, and a huge surge in the number and size of vans,\u201d MacPherson says.\nHe describes the popular NC500 route as \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d: it put the Highlands on the map, but too suddenly and without broad local buy-in and infrastructure development. He suggests that long-term government funding is needed to ease these pressures. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be left to locals to fill infrastructure gaps.\u201d",

For many people with dementia, this isolation has led to a significant deterioration in their condition and mental health,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWith infection rates rising once again, the government must provide free lateral flow tests for all visitors to care homes so that families are not put in an agonising position where they are forced to ration visits, leaving people with dementia once again isolated and alone.\u201d\nDr Sam Royston, the director of policy and research at Marie Curie, which runs hospices, also raised concerns.\n\u201cWithout the provision of free testing, many people living with a terminal illness and their families will face additional costs at a time when we know people are often struggling. This extra cost would put further strain and pressure on people\u2019s lives at a time when their basic living costs are already rising exponentially due to the high cost of living and energy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor those who can\u2019t afford the extra financial burden of paying for testing, this could lead to more people facing further social isolation towards the end of life.\u201d\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society is running a petition to keep testing free for care home visitors \u2013 which has been signed by more than 7,000 people \u2013 with the charity suggesting there are a number of options to do so, including providing tests to care homes or sending weekly tests to essential caregivers.\nCaroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said: \u201cNo one should have to pay out of their own pocket for tests in circumstances where the expert advice is clear that testing remains an important safeguard against Covid,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf care home visitors are going to continue to be asked to keep testing to protect their loved ones, it would be completely unacceptable to expect them to pay.\u201d\nThe concerns come as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests infection levels in the UK are on the rise once more, with the proportion of those over 70 who had Covid in the most recent week the highest since the ONS survey began.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care currently advises that testing for visitors to care homes should continue, in line with the wider care home testing regime.\nHowever the Guardian understands measures around testing as well as infection, prevention and control measures \u2013 including for care home visiting \u2013 are currently under review. The DHSC has said further details are to be set out by 1 April.\nThe DHSC is also soon expected to announce which at-risk groups will be eligible for free symptomatic testing. At present, it is thought this will include people over 80 or with compromised immune systems, as well as NHS and social care staff.\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAs set out in the government\u2019s Living With Covid plan, the approach to managing Covid-19 in adult social care services will continue to evolve in the coming months. We will continue to focus on providing care for those that need it and supporting people who are most vulnerable to Covid-19.\u201d",

        "content": "Fans of the biggest clubs are angry and it isn\u2019t a lack of trophies but a desire to gain a stake in the future\nThe hymns were still playing and the sermons were still being read, but the cathedral was in flames. The Parc des Princes, this monument to glory and desire, the place where you go to see your fantasies made flesh, was in revolt. They were watching Paris Saint-Germain, their team, rip Bordeaux to shreds with perhaps the most preposterously dazzling front three in the history of football. And they were furious about it.\nLionel Messi was booed, by many of the same fans who lined the streets to celebrate his arrival in August. Neymar was booed when he scored and cheered when he missed. It was profane and it was shocking and maybe that was the point. \u201cWe understand their disappointment, we understand their hatred,\u201d the PSG centre-half Presnel Kimpembe said. \u201cNow we must move forward in order to win Ligue 1.\u201d\nThe immediate assumption was that this was a sort of acid reflux, an intestinal reaction to the Champions League defeat against Real Madrid in midweek. On social media, fans of other clubs brandished their tiny violins. Fifteen points clear in Ligue 1, close to an eighth title in 10 seasons and with a front-row seat to the greatest show in world football. Maybe, you know, grow up?\nBut Paris has been at war with itself for a while now, for reasons that go far deeper than one second-half capitulation. Last month, the fan group Collectif Ultras Paris organised a picket of the fixture against Rennes, denouncing the Qatari owners, the sporting director, Leonardo, and even the head of communications. There were demands to \u201crespect the women\u2019s team.\u201d One banner even referenced the revolutionary reign of terror: \u201cToo many useless heads! Robespierre, where are you?\u201d And people say this club has no sense of history.\nWatching from the directors\u2019 box on Sunday was Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the club president who, since 2011, has spent more than \u00a31bn in transfer fees and overseen the most successful era in PSG\u2019s history. As the team he built was pilloried, it was possible to picture his puzzlement. Hang on. I bought you Messi, Neymar, Mbapp\u00e9, Ibrahimovic, Cavani, Dani Alves. What more, exactly, do you want?\nOf course, Paris fans have told Khelaifi exactly what they want. In a statement by the Collectif last week, they asked him: \u201cHow can you want to change everything for the people of Paris when you\u2019re more often seen at Fashion Week than meeting with your own fans?\u201d They demanded his resignation \u201cin the greater interest of a club; not a brand, not a marketing product. Our club!\u201d\nKimpembe may have claimed to understand the fans\u2019 anger, but his Ligue 1 comment betrayed the fact he hadn\u2019t a clue. Paris are 15 points clear of Marseille. Silverware isn\u2019t the problem here. The ultras\u2019 statement didn\u2019t mention the Champions League at all. Rather, the barracking of Neymar and Messi felt like an expression of a more fundamental need: a longing that no quantity of star signings or precious metal can truly fulfil.\nIf Khelaifi reckons a Champions League crown will placate the restless natives, he should look at the competition\u2019s past two winners. Bayern Munich are sauntering towards their 10th Bundesliga in a row, but at their most recent annual general meeting angry fans turned on the club president, Herbert Hainer, and the chief executive, Oliver Kahn, for refusing to discuss the club\u2019s controversial sponsorship deal with Qatar. \u201cWe are Bayern! You are not!\u201d members shouted at club officials who condescendingly invited them to pursue their grievances in court.\nChelsea fans, meanwhile, have been forced to watch the dismemberment of their club in real time. Again, sympathy will be in short supply. Some clearly see themselves as the real victims of the war in Ukraine, continuing to serenade their sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich. But for the silent majority and dickhead minority alike, the common theme is a basic powerlessness, the sense that the thing they care about is simply a piece in somebody\u2019s Monopoly game.\nYou could equally shift the focus to Manchester United or Tottenham, to Liverpool where an unconditional love for the team masks an underlying suspicion of the club\u2019s ownership, or Manchester City where the fanbase seems to be on a permanent war footing, fixated on slights and enemies. These are fans of the world\u2019s biggest clubs, home to its best players, reared on a diet of what 99% of the game would consider as unimaginable success. Why is nobody happy?\nPerhaps the answer lies in a common realisation, sharpened by the Super League protests and subsequent events: that wins and new signings are no real substitute for a genuine stake. For decades all fans, but especially those of big clubs, have essentially been commodified, patronised, seen not as partners but as eyeballs, a resource to be tapped. Supporter groups demand a place on the board and a share in the future. Clubs respond with viral content, soaring ticket prices and fan tokens.\nAnd so for the most part following a superclub has become a pursuit of ever-diminishing returns: a doomed search for lost meaning in an increasingly transactional relationship. \u201cOur club,\u201d the Paris ultras insisted. But it isn\u2019t and Khelaifi has the documents to prove it. In a sense these protests feel like a natural end point: an overdue recognition these are no longer our clubs and this is no longer our game. You can\u2019t bring down the church. But there comes a point where you may just stop believing.\n This article was amended on 17 March 2022. An earlier version misspelled Oliver Kahn\u2019s last name.",

The supply of workers has been reduced by an increase in long-term sickness affecting mainly the over 50 age group.\nAs a result, there is enough upward pressure on pay to persuade the Bank of England to continue raising interest rates, but the big squeeze on living standards has begun.\nThe latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics shows there is upward pressure on pay, but even so wages were struggling to keep pace with rising prices at the turn of the year and the gap looks set to widen during the course of 2022.\nRishi Sunak said the labour market had bounced back more rapidly than many people expected \u2013 and the chancellor is right about that.\nFew would have imagined that following the end of the furlough scheme last autumn the unemployment rate in the three months to January would stand at 3.9%, within a whisker of its pre-Covid low. Or that more timely data from HMRC would show 275,000 people added to payrolls in February.\nMeanwhile, the pool of available workers shrank by 100,000 in the three months to January, in large part because of people retiring or being long-term sick. Firms are having trouble filling the record number of job vacancies, hence the upward pressure on pay.\nEven so, in the three months to January, pay barely kept up with prices. Pay including bonuses over that quarter was 4.8% higher than a year earlier, up from 4.6% in the three months ending in December. But the ONS says the annual inflation rate was running at 4.7%, leaving workers hardly any better off.\nThe Bank of England has been surprised by the strength of the labour market in the past and is unlikely to be deterred from raising interest rates by the latest official jobs data, despite the uncertainty caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nYet higher borrowing costs, higher taxes and higher energy costs will weaken demand for labour over the coming months.

        "content": "Democrats tout president\u2019s role in responding to Russian aggression \u2013 and bid to highlight contrast with Putin-friendly Donald Trump\nJoe Biden came into the White House vowing to restore American leadership on the world stage. But the tumultuous end to the war in Afghanistan last year shook Americans\u2019 confidence in their new commander-in-chief, raising doubts about his competence and judgment and sending his approval ratings tumbling.\nNow Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has given Biden a second chance to demonstrate the steady leadership he promised, raising hopes among Democrats that the White House\u2019s efforts to punish Moscow for its shocking aggression will resonate with voters in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\nBut Democrats face stiff headwinds in their attempt to defy historical trends and maintain their narrow majorities in Congress. Among their biggest obstacles are Biden\u2019s deep unpopularity and the rising cost of gas, food and rent, for which Republicans have faulted Democrats.\nAt the Democrats\u2019 annual retreat in Philadelphia last week, party leaders spoke of a world \u2013 and an electorate \u2013 reshaped by Russia\u2019s invasion of its democratic neighbor. They said the conflict provided a new clarity of purpose \u2013 and a new villain: Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\nAs the war in Ukraine threatens to push already rising gas prices even higher, Democrats are blaming \u201cPutin\u2019s tax hike\u201d. At the same time, they are touting the administration\u2019s role coordinating a worldwide response to Russia, and the devastating impact of economic sanctions, highlighting a contrast with former president Donald Trump, who has continued to praise Putin.\n\u201cThat economic bomb that went off inside that dictator\u2019s regime would not have been possible without Joe Biden\u2019s leadership,\u201d New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats\u2019 election campaign arm, said in Philadelphia.\nThis strategy comes with considerable risk. Foreign policy is rarely front of mind for voters. The situation remains volatile and unpredictable. And Republicans are arguing that inflation was on the rise long before Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine.\nIn a recent op-ed for CNBC, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy blamed the administration\u2019s energy policy for exacerbating the current crisis.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Democrats\u2019 wayward leadership for the past year has undermined America\u2019s energy potential with senseless policies that seem designed to reverse decades of success and wreak havoc on our gas prices,\u201d he wrote.\nYet Democrats see some reasons to be hopeful. Recent surveys have shown an uptick in support for Biden, buoyed by approval of his handling of the conflict in Ukraine, though his overall ratings are still mired in the low 40s.\nAmericans broadly say they support the administration\u2019s response to the conflict, which includes efforts to cripple Russia\u2019s economy and aid Ukraine. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans overwhelmingly favor a ban on oil and gas purchases from Russia, even if it means paying more at the pump. Among those respondents, a quarter said they would be willing, at least in theory, to pay as much as it takes to support Ukraine, while 32% said they would be willing to pay between $1 and $2 more per gallon and 11% said they would be willing to pay more than $2 more.\nWhether voters blame Putin or Democrats for the rising cost of their gas may yet be a central question of the midterm election.\n\u201cDemocrats didn\u2019t cause this problem,\u201d Biden told Democrats in Philadelphia. \u201cVladimir Putin did.\u201d\nFor American voters, foreign policy is often an issue that \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter until it does,\u201d said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based thinktank.\nHe said matters of war and peace have \u201crepresented two opposite turning points\u201d in Biden\u2019s presidency. While Afghanistan hurt his image as a statesman who could rebuild America\u2019s credibility with allies after four turbulent years of Trump, Galston said the war in Europe has given the US president another chance to prove himself.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through about three decades \u2013 the post cold-war era, which has now ended, thunderously \u2013 when foreign policy didn\u2019t matter so much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it does, and I expect that it will continue to, because now we face severe challenges on our western front in Europe and our eastern front in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d\nHe added that the conflict \u201chas played to the strengths of president Biden and his foreign policy team: they are all deeply transatlantic in their history and their commitments.\u201d\nAs a senator and vice-president, Biden worked to strengthen the alliances forged in the aftermath of the second world war. Now as president, he sought to unite democracies around the world against the threat of rising autocracies, an effort complicated by the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol and the widespread belief among Republican voters that the 2020 election was stolen.\nIn recent weeks, Biden has rallied world leaders, tapping his deep foreign policy experience to reinvigorate old alliances that his predecessor had disparaged and nearly abandoned.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the alliance together \u2013 the EU, Nato, and all of our allies, including our Asian allies,\u201d he told Democrats in Philadelphia. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve been able to ramp up our economic pressure on Putin and further isolate Russia on the global stage.\u201d\nInflation has weighed down Biden\u2019s approval rating, as Republicans blame government spending and Democrats\u2019 energy policies for the rising cost of gasoline. Research suggests that rising gas prices drives consumer pessimism, an effect that is particularly noticeable among Americans who lived through the 1970s oil crisis.\nGuy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic political action committee Priorities USA, told reporters during a briefing last week that Biden\u2019s handling of the war \u201cwas reminding people why they voted for Joe Biden to begin with and, frankly, why they opposed Donald Trump\u201d.\nAlthough much of the Democrats\u2019 2022 messaging will be focused on the party\u2019s economic agenda and legislative accomplishments, Cecil said the war in Russia provides a stark contrast between the president and Trump, who has forced some in his party to walk a tightrope as they aim to condemn Putin without crossing the former president. Priorities USA recently released a dark new ad that highlights Trump\u2019s repeated praise of Putin and accuses Republicans of aligning with a \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d.\n\u201cDonald Trump continues to say he wants to be a player in politics; he\u2019s endorsing primary candidates around the country,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cHe\u2019s raising money for candidates at Mar-a-Lago. He\u2019s doing campaign events, and I think every candidate should be held accountable for Trump\u2019s position.\u201d\nIn Philadelphia, Democrats expressed confidence that Biden\u2019s leadership in recent weeks would shake the long shadow cast by the administration\u2019s exit from Afghanistan.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that his numbers have already bounced back up, and I think you\u2019re going to see that the worst is behind us, and the next chapter is going to be where the American people rediscover they elected a strong, decent man, who is fighting for very important things,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the Democrats that are doing that with him against Republican opposition.\u201d",
